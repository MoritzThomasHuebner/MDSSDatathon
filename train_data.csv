trn_1,"I really enjoy coming to this movie theater​. The prices are very reasonable ($3-5). The snacks are a little expensive, but you do get refills on the popcorn and soda.There is a game room there to help pass the time while waiting for your movie to start. The staff is very friendly, and the bathrooms are decent. I highly recommend this movie theater whether you are on a budget or not.",1
trn_2,"I heard this place was pretty good so I decided to try it out, my experience was bad. I've been to similar pizza places with the same ""build-your-own"" concept. I began building my pizza and when I got to the ""proteins"" I told the guy (didn't have a name tag) that I wanted all the proteins then he quickly said ""You can't do that, the cheese won't cook all the way"". I've been to Pieology and Fired Pie and they both had no issue with allowing me to put all the proteins and the pizzas cooked to perfection. It didn't seem like this guy was too fond of my idea of putting every meat because maybe they lose money that way or something, regardless I was shocked that this was my custom pizza and I couldn't even customize it to my liking. I ordered a pizza anyway and it was sub-par. Not bad I guess but next time I'll make the drive to Fired Pie in Downtown Phoenix instead.",-1
trn_3,This place is bomb! It was a long wait but worth it i promise. We ordered the hot Cheeto elote bomb! The orange chicken bomb! And the mangodana and spicy watermelon. There's a long line for a reason and staff is really nice working hard and fast. Can't wait to come back and haven't left yet.,1
trn_4,"Came here for my friend's 21st birthday dinner with a group of 6 people. The atmosphere didn't seem too crowded for a prime dinner time or during happy hour time (5:30-6:30pm). But the service was pretty slow throughout our dining. It took a while for our food to get ordered as well as be brought to us. Also we brought a cake to eat there after the dinner portion and asked if they could store it for us in their kitchen so we assumed that it'd be refrigerated at least - but when the cake was brought out, it was lukewarm and definitely was not refrigerated. I thought it was a basic rule to know that something like this should be refrigerated but was disappointed that it wasn't. Also we mentioned it was our friend's birthday, but there was nothing in particular that was done for her birthday? Seemed kind of like there wasn't anything special that Kaya does for birthdays, for example singing happy birthday or having some of the workers gather to sing? Also the person refilling the water came too frequently that it was almost disturbing our dinner. And lastly, when we got our checks, they gave it to us with the customer copy on top when the merchant copy should be on top. Maybe these are petty things I'm reviewing about but I think these are also basic restaurant manners. I would give the service a 3/5. 

We shared the Jerked Pork & Plantain Nachos appetizer. The plantain chips were really good but I would say that the flavors were not consistent throughout. For my dinner entree I ordered the flank steak cemita, which was a sandwich with sliced pieces of steak, romaine lettuce, avocado, tomato, cilantro, pickled red onion, Oaxaca cheese, black bean and chipotle aioli. I got a side of sweet potato fries to go with that. The cemita was actually very good. All the flavors blended very well together. I didn't feel that it was seasoned too salty or too bland. Overall was very pleased with my entree order. I would give the food a 4/5. 

Not sure if I would come here again any time soon just because it is more of a high-end restaurant that college students would not be able to afford very often.",1
trn_5,"I was in Scottsadale last month and made a spur-of-the-moment decision to get my teeth whitened for my upcoming nuptials.  A friend suggested Brookstone Dental, so I made an appointment (they were excellent on accommodating my schedule).  The results were fantastic.  My teeth were noticeably (but not shockingly) brighter and I could not be happier with the results.  Excellent staff there as well and the office itself - very modern; very hi-tech.  I wished I lived in Az to go there regularly.",1
trn_6,"I was excited when this Villa Madina opened. I'm excited when any place that potentially has vegan options in its menu, opens up in a mall food court. Especially when I remember how much I enjoyed Villa Madina at Cross Iron Mills.

This place, however, needs some tweaking. The portions here are just as big as their Cross Iron Mills counterpart, but everything tastes either old, over dressed or reheated. The falafel balls tasted like the ones you get in a six-pack at Superstore. The tabouleh was swimming in extremely acidic dressing. I kept having to press it with my fork and shake it before eating it. The dolmades, however weren't bad. 

I want to root for them, because, again, vegan options in a Cowtown food court are hard to come by. But my tummy can't handle the old and acidic when I am hungry. I hope they improve, though. Or I'll just have to remember that pop a few antacids before hitting them up.",0
trn_7,These folks are really nice and accomodating. This is one of many different locations and I must say I get the same amount of attention and hospitality at the various locations I have been in. Cancer is never a pleasant thing but these guys try to make you feel comfortable as much as possible.,1
trn_8,"There's something about the vibe at Maizie's that feels so comfortable. It feels retro to me... a flashback to Indiana in the late '70s - early '80s. Maybe it's the giant bowls they serve the salads in. They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980. 

Here are some things I like best about Maizie's:

The wingless buffalo dip is deadly -- I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu). It's gotta be mostly cream cheese... how can you go wrong?!

The fries are good, but the potato cakes are frickin' awesome! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish, barely browned on either side.

The inside out burgers are literally filled with the items described (my fave is the Feta burger - stuffed with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and served with a thimble full of chipotle humus that packs a slight punch and is great on top of the burger as bizarre as that sounds)",1
trn_9,I purchased a living social gift certificate and this was my first visit. I will definitely go back. This is an outstanding service oriented salon. I have short thick hair and Allison gave me one of the best haircuts I have ever received! I have already made my second appointment.,1

trn_11,"We were at the Border Grill on Valentine's day, the food was amazing!! I had the chicken poblano enchiladas and they were incredible!  Our waitress on the other hand was not so great! A man delivered our menus and chips and he was much more friendly and helpful than our waitress who referred to Him her assistant, should have been the other way around.  Once I got a drink it was great, but she was slow, rude and didnt even tell us the specials.  I asked for a side of something and my meal was over by the time she had it delivered.  Then we waited fifteen minutes just to get our check!  Great food!  Bad waitress!  Would go again and hope for a better server.",1
trn_12,"I said YES to the dress today! Haley is who assisted me, along with her Mom. They were both so nice, friendly, professional and helpful. I am a very happy bride with the dress of my dreams! Thank you ladies for all of your time and help! I recommend this place to anyone! A++++",1
trn_13,"I can think of nothing I enjoy more for lunch than a well-crafted, hot sandwich. Bertha's sells a mean panini, and I can't bring myself to order anything but the one that features asparagus. It's that good. My wife surprised me with the asparagus panini on Valentine's Day, and it was the perfect gift.

For those of you who like sweets, this place has some fantastic cookies and dessert bars.",1
trn_14,"Beth and her team are absolutely fantastic. I travel extensively and we have never used a pet sitter that isn't a very close family friend. This year, our plans didn't work out, and 5 says before Thanksgiving I reached out to Beth in desperate mode for a sitter for a 16 week old retriever puppy, 12 year old yellow lab, and tiny special needs kitty. She accepted the request, came over without much notice for the meet and greet and did a phenomenal job with a tough group of animals. She kept us updated with texts, pics and notes and we were able to enjoy the holiday without stressing. We will spread the word to as many people as we can, I highly recommend Beth and the wags in the city team!",1
trn_15,I'm here almost daily. I love the staff always so helpful even encouraged me to branch out and try new teas.  I'm addicted to tea lattes and my latest is the cherry green tea vanilla latte iced.  There's plenty of space a great place for catching up with friends or studying.,1
trn_16,"I've been to this place twice now and I'm super indifferent. First I had the traditional gyro and the lemon oregano fries. Solid lunch on a Friday. I returned last week for a lamb special platter which included, 5-6 small strips of lamb (gyro), a side Greek salad, rice pilaf and warm pita bread. For a price tag of almost $12 I do not feel the portions are substantial for dinner, although the food is quite tasty and authentic. I will probably return as it is in my neighborhood but when I'm looking for a more hearty meal, I may drive a little further out for a similar cuisine.",0
trn_17,"Preface: I only eat sushi nigiri and sashimi and consider myself a sushi enthusiast (it is my favorite food). 

This was my third time eating at this restaurant. The first two times were great, and all of a sudden everything went to hell in a hand basket. 

Let me summarize:
1) I had to ask 3 times to get a miso soup (not a big deal on its own)
2) food took over 45 minutes to come out from the point of us placing the order (apparently because the unagi needed to be cooked...hey, next time bring everything else out first and then the unagi later like every other sushi place does. Maybe that way our sushi won't be room temperature and taste off.)
3) the maguro (tuna) sushi tasted old and overly fishy to the point where my coworker, who loves tuna, had to spit it out into his napkin. I unfortunately swallowed my piece of tuna and now I'm feeling ill writing this review.
4) our waiter did not remove the tuna from our bill even though it cost $7 and our entire bill was $218. He claimed he spoke with his Mgmt and they refused to remove it from the bill. I'm pretty sure that is a lie as almost any manager knows you SHOULD remove something off the bill if someone has to literally spit out into their napkin because it tastes disgusting.

What makes me ultimately write this review is that Maiko did not care about whether we enjoyed our meals and would ever come back. It was the 3rd time I had eaten there in a month, and I was a huge fan. But instead here I am feeling nauseous in bed from that ****ing tuna, writing my first ever negative review. 

Eat there with caution--it will either be great or you will literally leave angry and feeling ill.",-1
trn_18,"Come for the great dogs, stay for the conversation. Sidewalk socialite and local philanthropist, Vic will definitely put a smile on your face :).",1
trn_19,"We came here for the hot pot. The portions were enough to fill us up. It was cool how they had the self serve sauce concoction stands in the front. There drinks are pretty nice as well. The waiter, although overwhelmed, was still cordial.",0
trn_20,"Love this place, especially for happy hour. Can be a bit pricey outside happy hour but still great food (steaks). The servers are very attentive and friendly. Can get pretty loud and crowded on the weekend nights. Did I mention happy hour yet? Or breakfast? go for breakfast, ask to be seated with Teresa... she is awesome. Byron and James at the bar during the week for happy hour; can't go wrong. Did I mention their awesome happy hour yet? :)",1

trn_22,"We Love Angela and her Lil Brown Sugar's Cupcake Café!  Our Dessert and Candy displays would not be complete without her rosette sugar cookies!  OMG!  They taste as good as they look.  And the cake pops!  Forget about it! Angela is the best! She will do whatever we ask of her like a Little Mermaid Birthday cake, so moist and delish!  Or chocolate mustaches on a stick, or mini pies on a stick!  She does it all!  Thank you so much, Angela!",1
trn_23,"My family and I love this restaurant in general, but we particularly love this central Scottsdale location. The new decor is really comfortable and gives a lot more ambience than the old model. We ate there this weekend for lobster fest, yay, but I was the only one who ordered something with lobster. My husband and son both ordered shrimp scampi (weirdos...it's Lobster Fest). Our waiter was friendly, got our drink orders and yummy hot biscuits out to us right away. It wasn't long that the piping hot shrimp scampi orders arrived at our table. I was promised mine would be out soon. I ordered the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. A few minutes later the manager came by and apologized for my order not coming out when the guys meals came. She was a little horrified by it, I could tell. She mentioned that she never lets food to come out in stages like this! I could tell someone was going to get a ""what for"" any second. She was very, very sweet and as soon as my dinner was ready she brought it over herself and again apologized. She said she was so embarrassed it happened, and I really didn't even think anything of it until she mentioned it. She comp'ed my meal and it was the most expensive dish at our table! Of course we were super pleased by such service. Mistakes happen, and her acknowledging the mistake and apologizing is all I really needed, but it takes really great customer service to go that extra mile. Our waiter also apologized and overall, we were all very pleased with our meals...super yummy...and our service..overall, great!  We will be back again and again.",1
trn_24,"First time here tonight with friends and it was a good experience. For sushi rolls had the Mariachi Samurai, Lemon Roll & Secret Weapon. All 3 worth trying! The miso soup was good but maybe chunks of Tofu were too big. Bigger than any I've seen before in miso. For a starter the Stellar Chips were really good. Manager was really friendly. Turns out we had some friends in common. No complaints really. I will be back again.",1

trn_26,"Small place. Good Chinese food. This place is easy to miss. Blink once and you may find yourself making a u-turn. Their house specialties are pretty good. Try to stay away from the traditional menu since all places make these dishes differently. I personally like the spicy shrimp with shell, porkchops Peking style, honey walnut shrimp and the spare ribs in black bean sauce. They have oxtail soup, which I shall definitely try on my next visit. this place is really small and is not for the intimacy freaks. The lunch specials are quite cheap but the entrees and specials can add up quick.",0
trn_27,My shits look bigger than their dinner plates. If you're looking somewhere to fill you up don't come here. Expensive & over priced for snack size meals.,-1

trn_31,"The bread, the ambiance and the bruschetta alone are worth visiting this quaint restaurant located on the waterfront.  Such a relaxing last lunch before heading home to Chicago.",1
trn_32,"Not impressed in general but it was OK.  I came here with a group of 6 girlfriends and thought immediately that the place had the feeling of a chain restaurant...the tables were too big (3 double tables were put together but could have easily fit 4 on each side) and the restaurant was just too big.  Size-wise I'd expect it of Joeys, Cactus, Earls, or the Cheesecake factory..but not really what i'm looking for in Italian.  

As for the food, it was average. I live in the UK and caesar salads aren't common here so I was looking forward to a traditional caesar.  I also asked for light dressing.  Way too much dressing and too much bacon - like actual full strips!  Way too big for an appetizer salad. Could have for sure been a full meal.  

Had a plain Margarhita pizza as my main. Not adventurous but to be honest I didn't feel it was the place to order a special pasta. Sort of like how I'd never order pasta at a chain...

Anyway maybe my expectations were just wrong.  I guess I expected a trendy small-ish Yorkville restaurant but instead it was huge with no character.  Pretty affordable but gladly would have paid more for a better atmosphere.",-1
trn_33,"RIPPED OFF. Our lunch here today was the worst dining experience we've had in Calgary. Our $15 chicken donburi bowl was literally white rice and three slices of chicken. Additionally the Bento Box we ordered had dry fish on the sushi and the edamame was soggy and brown (not crisp, green or fresh). The salmon teriyaki consisted of three quarter-sized pieces of fish. For a $30 meal it looked like $5 worth of ingredients. We raised our concerns about the value and were told by staff that ""we understand the portions are not fair, but we can't do anything about it."" What kind of customer service is that?? There was no attempt to offer us a discount or side item. Overall we felt extremely ripped off. Also, the quality was questionable - which is something you shouldn't be thinking about when eating raw fish! With so many other restaurant options in Calgary, we highly recommend going elsewhere. We will NEVER be returning.",-1
trn_34,Waited 20 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. The server finally came over after we asked 2 people for our server. After that she took our order on a newspaper that she grabbed off a stand because she didnt have her pad. She took out orders and the wrong food came out. Food was bland with little flavor. I do not recomment this place.,-1
trn_35,They did an excellent job pulling my loan together in such a short time. I enjoyed working with Michael and Adam. They made sure that they kept the process smooth and easy. Somehow they pulled things off without too many worries on my end.,1
trn_36,"I love Lavazza coffee, which is served here. Totally Italian style. The coffee is good, but, unfortunately,  the service is not so good.  The first day, I went to get a coffee, and ordered it, and paid for it. 10 minutes later, I found out its supposed to be free to hotel guests. I had charged it to my room, and showed my ID...she obviously knew she should have told me my coffee was free! The rest of our time here...we made sure not to be charged! 

The coffee is very good, and you can choose between mild or bold. It is served hot or cold...but, unfortunately,  our last coffee was supposed to be hot, but was only luke warm. There is plenty of seating to enjoy your coffee and it's conveniently located in the walkway between the Palazzo and the Venetian.",0
trn_37,"The food is good, but if you're in a hurry and want to order take-out, don't come here.  Even on nights when there is hardly any one in the place, the service is extremely slow.   The prices are too high for a take-out diner too.  The only saving grace is that if I order the ""large"" portion, I can get two meals out of it.",0
trn_38,"Quality sucks! Bought a necklace 2 days ago, and when I opened it, it  was broken!!!! Wtf? And I call to see if I can get a new one and they say no because it has been a couple of days...    I did not want my money back I just wanted a necklace that was not broken.   Horrible customer service.",-1
trn_39,"Update since new management took over on July, 22 2015-

Things have returned to normal.  It was a very rough 3 months for the residents during the transition.  That being said, the building is now cleaned every week, the free coffee/latte machine is working, packages are no longer left in the unsecured lobby, exercise equipment has been fixed etc.   LaKeycha, the Assistant Property Manager, may have had a lot to do with the positive changes.  

This is a great location, living above Earthfare is so convenient, the building is quiet.
Also, changes are coming to the units. Upgraded wood floors and appliances.",1
trn_40,"Nice property to stay with if you like to stay off of the Strip. (which is only about 1 1/2 to 2 miles away.  

Staff is nice and courteous.  Good maid service.

Rooms are kept clean and of course, include a kitchen, which is always nice to have. Full-sized refrigerator, microwave, 2 burner stove top, diswasher, garbage disposal. Great for extended stays. Complimentary breakfast (served 7 days) and light dinner fare served during the week. 

Very convenient to the McCarren Car Rental property which is approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from the Homewood property. 

Beds and pillows are comfortable (though I still maintain that the Hilton Doubletree line has the best!).  

The only restaurant within walking distance would be the PanoVino.  You will need a car!",1
trn_41,"I've not taken a lot of time to find a solid Chinese restaurant here in Arizona.  My wife and I recently moved to Peoria and this establishment has popped up on my Yelp feed a few times.  We ordered take out because that's how Chinese food should be eaten. 

First, the entire Grand Ave. x Peoria Ave. exchange is just bizarre and really missed up.  Unfortunately, the restaurant sits kitty corner to Wendy's right on the corner. 

We walked in and the restaurant is very clean.  We were greeted instantly and handed take out menus.  I went with the Spicy Orange Chicken combo and my lovely bride went with the Sweet & Sour Chicken combo.  In less than 10 minutes, our food was produced to us fresh and piping hot. 

Next, we got a ton of food.  It's a solid combo guaranteed to put you in an Asian food coma.  For my Spicy Orange Chicken combo, my main entrée came with a scoop of fried rice, a solitary piece of fried shrimp, a few pieces of sweet & sour chicken and an egg roll.  That's a lot of food for $10 as far as I'm concerned.

I liked that the orange chicken was spicy as it should be and not caramelized in a candy coating of orange syrup.  The egg roll was delicious as was the piece of fried shrimp I was given.  The few pieces of sweet & sour chicken I was given was also quite tender and flavorful.  The only part of the combo I didn't care for was the fried rice.  That's all it was... fried rice in some shoyu.  No tiny morsels of pork or green onions or carrots or anything.  I love fried rice, but it was bland and sort of lackluster. 

It was still a good experience and they made a great first impression on me.  A solid 4-star contender, indeed!",1
trn_42,"Horrible service, would give 0 stars if possible. We tried to use a Groupon here and got yelled at because we didn't make a reservation and print the Groupon. The restaurant was totally empty (we were literally the only ones), and it's 2017 sorry I don't carry a printer around. Don't go here, many many better options to eat in Montreal.",-1
trn_43,Delicious wine! They have a very wide variety of wines from chardonnays to light summer wines to deep reds like Sangiovese and Cabs! One of my favorite places so far in the Phoenix area! Would definitely recommend if you are in the area. Great happy hour deals too! And the woman serving us was very knowledgeable and welcoming from the beginning-- we will definitely go back!,1
trn_44,"Rainbow Donuts is THE BEST. After a confusing mixup with finding a dessert for my wedding reception, the owner, Jason, said they would rush a batch of 20 dozen donuts! They also threw in a few dozen extra and made my wife and I two heart  shaped donuts with pink frosting. Not only are their donuts great, but their hospitality is incredible! They saved our reception and we can't thank them enough!",1
trn_45,We go for breakfast at least once per week.  The food and selection are excellent and the service is fast and courteous.  This is the best place for a home-cooked breakfast in the area!!,1
trn_46,"This is a good pizza place, the staff was attentive and knowledgeable in getting everything done, I've never been there before and received a coupon for a free pizza in the mail. So decided what the hell let's go. One thing I don't like is everything is all up-sell. A free pizza should mean free and not $18.00 at the end of the line for a basic pizza and a small salad. Other than that the pizza was great.",1
trn_47,We've done both take out and delivery from here.  Both have been good experiences. I think the piece that makes this place really stand out is the appetizers. Their dumplings are so good. They seem to be homemade and not the bulk frozen kind. I enjoy the crab rangoon also. Spring rolls and egg rolls are also very good. I am still working on finding a favorite main dish but the dumplings keep me coming back for more!,1
trn_48,"Great coffee, and they made me a great custom vegan sandwich!",1
trn_49,"One of my absolute favourite places to grab xiao long bao in the city!  It can get pretty busy at times, but the food is consistently delicious. Perfect for a meal with friends, brunch with the family, or simply to go for good old-fashioned Chinese comfort food. It's also my go-to place to order out when I have a cold; there's absolutely nothing better than a warm bowl of savoury soy milk soup for the heart and soul.

The Good: The restaurant itself is clean and modern with spacious seating. The food itself boasts amazing flavours that are both rich and comforting at the same time. My boyfriend and his family first took me here a few years ago, and I've been in love with xiao long bao ever since. The ones here are made fresh (there's even a little window at the back where you can see the chefs prepare them!), and are always bursting with soup and juice. Also really enjoy the savour soy milk soup here. My friend Lisa recently introduced me to the wontons in a spicy chili oil - they're delicious! Definitely try those, too, if you have room to spare. Even if you don't get the wontons in spicy chili oil, I'm a big fan of the spicy chili sauce that they have on each table here and love dousing my dumplings in them.

The Bad: Can get a little busy at times, but the wait never gets too long. Also, sometimes the seating can be a bit awkward just because of the size of the tables (i.e) a table of four often gets seated at a large, circular table for 6-8 people, etc.) Nothing too fussy, though!

The Ugly: How much I end up ordering and devouring when I get there. Definitely can't be good for my health, but #YOLO, no ""ragratz!"" ;) 

Bottom line: Amazing food at decent prices, with flavours that never fail to disappoint. Call me a fan. I'll definitely be back...multiple times.",1
trn_50,The Carne Asada tacos are as good as ever. I've done both dine and take out. Service has always been good. I enjoy sitting outside when the weather is good. The restaurant is comfortable and has a nice atmosphere.,1
trn_51,This place is definitely a hidden treasure in Chandler!!  The food was absolutely delicious. The waiter and chef went out of thier way to make the entire experience one to remember. One of our guests is allergic to soy and they were more than accommodating. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 we because I used a 2 for $19 Groupon and they scanned it first and then a friend happened to be in the area and joined us.  I told my friend about the Groupon but the waiter said they could only have one Groupon per table. I then aske if we could use the 4 for $60 Groupon. The waiter called the owner and said we could not. The waiter was honestly apologetic.  Had the owner been more accomadating I would have definitely given 5 stars.  The food and service was amazing!!!!,1
trn_52,"My favorite spot for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh. The food is delicious and inspired - not the generic sandwiches and sodas you get at a corner deli. I've had their soups, sandwiches, sides, desserts, and coffee. The breakfast menu looks amazing as well but I'm never downtown for breakfast so I can't say much about that.

The prices are a bit higher for a meal than, say, nearby Chipotle or Subway, but the quality of the food you get more than makes up for the difference in my opinion. I usually get a small soup and small side and that's enough for a satisfying lunch for me and comes out to be about $7-8. They have a core menu of items and also daily and monthly specials so there's always something new to try. One thing to keep in mind is that the sandwiches are made to order while the salads are pre-made that morning and in to-go boxes. 

Seating is limited to bar-style seating along the wall and windows, which works fine for me since I'm usually just looking to grab a quick lunch during the workday and not to have a long sit-down meal.

I hope Bluebird Kitchen never leaves downtown because there's really no other similar spot downtown like it.",1
trn_53,"As a rental tenant and having to deal with this company as a third party, my experience has been HORRIBLE. Called in on Monday to the property manager to report our AC was out. Was called the next day for the electrician to set up an appoinment, (why not an AC tech on the first trip, when that's the issue I called in...) The electrician who showed up in a van that said HVAC/Electrical/etc... told me that the AC unit was the problem and not the electrical....(I knew that). He said that an AC tech would have to come back the next day. Wednesday I was supposed to get a call and they never called. Thursday, NHW called and said a tech was on his way, so I left work, got home and the tech was rude, unprofessional and did not know what he was doing, he figured out that the compressor was bad and would need to be replaced. Friday they sent a tech in the morning to clean to the coils to verify if they could replace the unit under warranty, Friday afternoon, they sent ANOTHER AC tech that verified that the unit would need to be replaced and would be done by Saturday. NO calls TUESDAY and finally had the unprofessional come back and spend the entire day to replace the compressor.... If they would have sent the AC tech the first day, I could have had the problem fixed by Thursday or Friday and been happy. I spent $300 at Lowes to get a portable AC unit and left work on 3 separate occasions.... This company needs to get their SH!* together.... I know when I buy a home that I WON'T be using this company for anything....",-1

We had an array of foods on our afternoon pool break on a beautiful Sunday.   The duckbreast salad special was great.   Two other salads.   The mushroom quiche was good and the deserts were all yummy.  We had almost all - then took leftovers for our pool break this evening ;) 

See you soon!",1

trn_60,"Our family members attended this restaurant last night to celebrate several birthdays.  Haven't concluded yet the next morning what was worst, the food or the service.  Evening started out with an approximate wait of 30 minutes to receive my ordered cocktail.  Also of note, out of several of the featured on tap draft beers.  Waitress seemed to not have a clue.  Several times, some in our party came close to getting up to talk with a manager.  Entrees finally arrived with a mixed bag of results.  Walleye was noted as being very good while the Faroe Island Salmon entree was bland and tasteless.  Don't they have spices in the kitchen?  Granted this is a newer restaurant but it has been open now for almost 3 months.  Bottom line, save your self some $$$ and frustration and have dinner elsewhere until this place gets their collective act together and determines if they want to be a place for the bar crowd or a fine dining establishment.  Right now they succeed at neither.",-1

trn_62,"**Disclaimer** Did not dine here, but was looking forward to...

I made reservations back in October 2017 for New Years Eve dinner on OpenTable.  On 12/30/2017, at ~5pm, I received a phone call from the owner demanding my credit card information, in the event that we did not show, or cancelled last minute, that the restaurant would charge the card $50/person.  I told the owner that I would call him back to confirm (as I was not comfortable giving out this information in a public place), but he instead decided to cancel my reservation in OpenTable.  

While I don't disagree with a deposit policy for NYE dinner at a restaurant, I didn't think the way by which this owner decided to go about it was appropriate.  He sounded extremely perturbed by other customers calling and canceling last minute, and made reference to that in the call.  Very rude and condescending tone on the phone as well.

I am happy the reservation was cancelled, as it would have been bothersome to know I spent money on an establishment that treats potential customers in that manner.",-1

My friend and I had halibut and haddock and I highly recommend them both. Also, service there were very good, waitresses there were very friendly.

Ever since I discovered Oregano's I've never been back to Olive Garden. I think their food is fantastic and I've learned to try other things aside from their meatballs...ummm! Service is always, always, always fantastic! The servers are so helpful and friendly. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If you do come here...be sure to explore the menu.

One bad thing, but I can't knock a star off for it, is that the wait can be extremely long especially during lunch hours. I've waited an hour before and at other times, I've gotten lucky to get the last table available. 

Check out the pictures!",1

Great daily happy hour deals in the bar area! We like the shrimp cocktail, calamari, filet medallions, and other small plates. Their meat is always cooked perfect and is very flavorful. Nice selection of spirits and wine. I like your dining rewards program too! Great service with TJ and the managers are always walking around checking in on your meal. Top notch!",1

trn_72,"I stumbled upon Cinquieme Peche last night with a friend.  As we were strolling in the Mont Royal neighborhood, it started pouring heavily.  We ran into the first place that looked reasonable, mostly to avoid the rain.  Our lack of planning, as it turns out, paid off.  Cinquieme Peche is a small, highly imaginative French brasserie serving a limited amount of starters and entrees off a chalkboard menu.  For our starters, we had the seal (yes, the kind that clap and do tricks) tartare and a lobster broth with scallops, mussels and pancetta.  The tartare was interesting, the meat itself is fairly bland but the texture was pleasant and went well with the capers.  My lobster broth was subtle but pleasant.  As for the mains, I had the filet served with broccoli rabe, escargot and gnochi.  An unexpected combination but was perfect.  My friend had the sea breem, seared on a pan and finished off in the oven.  It was served with artichoke puree and roasted fennel and a light tomato sauce.  Outstanding.  The owners, two brothers, are from France and have been operating this restaurant  for 7 years now.  Although it is expensive, I would highly recommend it.",1
trn_73,"There is a nice feel to the place, with a decadent Chandelier hanging as soon as you walk in. Staff is friendly and helpful. It is small but comfortable. The food was good. I had the meatloaf with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. Though  the brussel sprouts are not your conventional type but were good. It would have been a wonderful experience if it weren't for the bill. The prices in my opinion are much higher than they should be, perhaps if the portions were larger it may justified. It seems they are not sure what they want to be, a high end restaurant or local hip bar.",1

trn_77,"Overall I've got mixed emotions about it.....

This is where I purchased my first clubs, putter and golf bag. Colton was working with me and they guy was awesome; full of knowledge, patient, and articulate. The guy worked his a$$ off seriously.  I came to frequent this place regularly. 

Well Colton moved on-you know the saying poop flows down hill. The customer service dropped; you might not be acknowledged walking in the store let alone the thought of being approached with a welcoming smile and a handshake. 

The dudes act like old tour pros who want the fame and glory: they are smug and pompous. It really turns my stomach. 

The place is clean but its small and packed like a constipated small intestine. You will bump into stuff or people, no if ands or butts about it folks. 

Van's is fair on pricing and if you haggle a bit they will budge on prices excluding ping and titleist ( those two ""ping and titleist""  are like 12 year old bullies who failed for three years, you go down on their prices and they'll whip ya a&&). 

The parking lot is small and used by multiple establishments, there are two reserved parking spaces for Van's shoppers.",0

trn_79,"This review is for the nagoya-style ramen, a dark auburn-coloured, richly flavoured broth with perfect noodles, a nice amount of ground beef and pork, and a smattering of sesame seeds. I've never had ramen like this before, and I absolutely loved the broth...but my dining companion said she'd rate the soup a 3 due to its lack of inclusions, like egg, veggies or slices of fatty pork. It did have some sliced mild peppers in it, but certainly was a very brothy soup overall.

Me personally, I thought it was lovely! So I'm giving it a 4.

I also enjoyed a lemon chu-hai, a refreshing, not-too-sweet carbonated alcoholic bevvy that brought me right back to Tokyo, where I remember drinking it out of cans while touring the city. But it's quite light on the booze, so don't expect to get a buzz from just one.

Overall, neat little spot! I heard the wings and corn fritters are also amazing here, so I'll be back.",1
trn_80,So chalking up last couple experiences to going in during lunch when there's a crowd. Morning crew is super chill and helpful. Great tips and ideas on how to reach my goals.

trn_82,"This is my first time here. Although there is room for improvement, I will likely not stay anywhere else when I come to Vegas. The hotel is large enough but is also small enough so you don't get lost. LAVO has a nice bar and restaurant and I like the lounge. I am not a big fan of Tao Beach and Nightclub. An added bonus is that it is right across the street from Bare at the Mirage, my favorite pool in Vegas. 

The Big:  The rooms are huge. King bed with a sunken living room and two sinks and a separate tub from the shower.  The food court has a lot of variety and the Grand Lux is a great 24 hr joint that is close to the hotel towers. There is an Expressamente to buy coffee and a bagel, Bouchon Bakery to also buy something on the fly and Cocilino for gelato. It is also close to the Canal shops and my favorite Italian restaurant Zefferino that my Italian friend turned me on to.

The Little:  The towels and robes are too small and not plush enough for a $200/night hotel. In addition, the made did not give me more bath soap after the first night. Lastly, the internet connection was spotty and the TV reception wasn't much better. I hate paying for a resort fee when crap doesn't work properly.

OVERALL RATING:  3.5",0

trn_88,"The food was passable. The dining room was nearly empty at 7 pm on a weeknight. Not that I crave a crowded and noisy dining experience, but it would've been nice to think we'd made the right choice eating there by seeing other diners voting with their wallets.

I don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.

The food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out).",-1
trn_89,"I went with my sister on Sunday to try on wedding dresses for the first time. I expected to get a little panicky, but I had a wonderful experience! Owner Rebecca took the time to help me pick out about a dozen dresses to try on, and then helped me in and out of them, giving me options along the way like jeweled sashes and lace shrugs for my not so perfect shoulders. The dresses are amazing and not what you will see at chain-bridal stores. The decor is soft and vintage and made me want to move right in. 

I have not chosen a dress yet, but I am grateful for the personalized and never-pushy service. Keep in mind that if you order a dress it will take 16 weeks to deliver. Not for the last-minute bride.

I almost forgot: Bridesmaid alterations are ONLY $40!!!! That is amazing! Seriously, I am a professional seamstress and I can't touch this price.",1
trn_90,"Green is AMAZING!!!!!  I absolutely love this place!  I go here a few times a month and I think I've tried everything on their menu.  All food there is vegan and they serve up amazing comfort food that resembles foods I ate growing up as a full on carnivore, but now I can enjoy them as a vegan too.  The wings are amazing and I usually get them every time as a side dish.  They have awesome sandwiches, rice or noodle bowls, salads.  They are the only place I know that serves up crab puffs that taste like I remember, only meat and dairy free!  The Tsoynamis (basically a vegan version of the Dairy Queen blizzard) are absolutely amazing.  This restaurant is amazing for vegans, gluten-free vegans, vegetarians, omnivores... everyone!  Thank you GREEN for being there and working hard everyday to create amazing food!",1

Kevin was so consistent and precise with his massage, that I felt every part of my body equally relaxed. His details in massage is like no other I've had the pleasure to experience. 

I am so grateful for the skills these therapist have.  But someone like Kevin who was just amazing at what he does, deserves to be recognized. Thank you so very much Kevin! I will be back!!",1

I didn't love the rolls but the nigiri were good, with fresh fish and good proportioning between rice and fish. For a quick, no frills sushi dinner, I would be back, but would stick to nigiri. The purple rice was fun and different - I prefer white rice but they pull it off okay.",1
trn_99,"Excellent experience with this company.  I had a leak in the drain pan, and called for a service call.  Received a return call almost immediately and was able to schedule a service call for the next morning.  Technician was top notch.  Knowledgeable, professional, courteous, competent.  He diagnosed problem, presented solutions, told me wha to do until repair part was available.  2 days later I received a phone call saying part was in, and scheduled the service call for next day.  Technician arrived promptly at scheduled time, performed the repair, and asked if I had any questions.  Overall excellent service.  I would rate them 5 stars.",1
trn_100,"You're supposed to watch a little bit longer on your waiters. You better rattle off your whole order right away when they ask, ""What do you want, assholes?"" You may or may not get a paper hat saying, ""You've taken more packages than UPS""..and yes, drink prices are strip drink prices.

We asked the hostess for a table for 4 and she told me to hold on while she danced the rest of the song, ignoring us but sat us after a minute.

But its a fun atmosphere if you come with the right frame of mind. The food isn't too bad, my brisket sandwich was overflowing with BBQ sauce and meat and I wanted a fork, but my waiter said I could stop being a pansy and eat with my fingers. When asked for a glass of water, he said that we're in the middle of the desert and that the water was being saved for Taco's water show. Bottom line though our drinks and food came out pretty fast and there weren't any complaints. At a table next to us, a mom had brought her kids with her. She was wearing a paper hat with 'MILF' written across it by the waiter. She wasn't aware of what it meant.  Our waiter said if we didn't tell her, he wouldn't bring us our drinks. I don't think I'll ever see teenage boys' faces be any redder than they were. We let her know and she was pretty red in the face too. Good times. Parents should have Urban Dictionary saved on their websites to keep up with the times, though cmon...everyone knows what a MILF is.

Ah, Taco. The man that makes this joint run. He'll give bachelorettes a lap dance while he sports a thong hanging out of his pants. Too hot to handle!! He popped in a Grease sing-a-long DVD and made his own commentary that was pretty entertaining, along with making old men dance with the videos for free drinks. But his crowning achievement is his water show. A spin off the Bellagio fountains, I won't give anything away but you'll be laughing your ass off by the time its over.

Base humor and crude jokes run rampant so if you have a stick in your ass, go somewhere else.",1

trn_103,"My experience here has been awful. I have been to this nail salon on several different occasions, but this past one was the worst. An earlier occasion was getting a pedicure with my mother. We had an appointment, but my nail tech started on my pedicure about 10-15 before they started on my mom's so they were almost done with mine when they started my mom's so we couldn't enjoy it together. 

This last experience has been the worst. I decided to get a full set of acrylics for prom. I believe it was the owner of the salon that worked on me. I felt extremely rushed. I have had acrylics before, so I know what they're supposed to look like. The nails are extremely thick and uneven. The acrylic starts too far away from my cuticle and they already look like they're grown out. And he didn't clean up the acrylic that is still attached to the sides of my nails that's cemented to the sides of my cuticles. One nail is even CROOKED!!!! He did not file neatly and I left with acrylic shavings still attached to my nails. The nail polish was uneven also. He also got dirt on my nail polish and put a top coat over the dirt anyway. 

He was also extremely rude to me. I told him I wanted a coffin shape, but I didn't want them to be very long since it's very impractical and he told me that they have to be a certain length. I said that I didn't want the coffin then and wanted to say I want a rounded square kind of look. In the middle of me trying to explain that, he interrupted me and did the coffin anyways. I kept telling him I wanted it shorter than that and he ended up yelling ""oh my god! Why didn't you tell me!"" It was extremely disrespectful. 

He was also hurting me! He was filing my nail so hard that the tip came off on a couple nails. On the first nail that broke he said ""s**t!"" Extremely unprofessional!!! And now my nails are extremely sore and I will NEVER come back here again. 

NEVER COME HERE FOR ACRYLICS",-1

There is on that is a scary yellow one that is safe but it is hot enough to remove layers of flesh from inside you mouth and possibly other orifices.

They did apologize but didn't bother to see if she was cut or bruised. It's not fun eating with a wet shoe people. 

The food there is pretty good but the selection seemed small but we were told it was a holiday thing due to the fight and cinco de mayo days. 

The crab was good and the herb crusted beer was very good too. The other food selections tended to be rather standard and nothing there that jumps out and catches your eye. They had two omelet stations which maybe you only needed one.

The man at the counter said that when they handed me my stupid bagel that he said egg sandwich, when he didn't he had said you're waiting for an order to go?  I said yes. I had checked with my mom because he was the one who had handed it to her and and when I check back with her,  she said the man had said you're waiting for an order to go? When I came back he was disputing that whole thing with me and I just said you know who's order is who's,  this is your restaurant you should know this and he just said I'm sorry what kind of a nasty attitude red hair tall gentleman I don't even care what his name it was I'm just never going back, too much if a hassle.",-1

trn_123,"We dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. 

I was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.

If you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!

trn_126,"Went to what seemed like a cool spot for bite for brunch, but was bitterly disappointed.  The food was just alright, and the service was horrible.  We had to ask for silverware and hunt down the bartender for drink refills.

At one point, a couple came in and sat near us at the bar, but the bartender wasn't present.  A waitress came behind the bar, filled up a couple of glasses with ice (the ice bin being directly in front of the couple,) all without a second glance at the customers.  She didn't bother telling the bartender that new customers had come it.

Overall, it was a very unsatisfying experience.",-1
trn_127,"This is BY FAR the best Middle Eastern restaurant I've eaten at. It's inside a small plaza that's nothing flashy, but step inside and it's like walking into a vacation. The place is small, cozy and elegant. All the staff is friendly. The prices are kinda high. 

The waitress warned me that the Arabic coffee is strong and sweet. She brought out a tiny expresso-sized coffee (I assumed I was getting a full mug), however, the price is reasonable compared to a real café and it was super yummy and just the right sweetness. 

Let me say that I've eaten at other Persian restaurants, such as Al-Ameera on Broadway, and that they have messed up my falafal before, with a terrible taste, that is, and well...how do you mess up something that is as popular as pizza to them?? But Sahara's falafal was generous and yummy. Their hummus is thick and creamy. Their pita bread is warm and made to perfection. I ordered a tabouli salad as an appetizer and it was my first time trying tabouli and it was very flavorful. It could have been a bland salad but the cook must have lots of experience with mint and lemon juice and exactly how to use them. 

I dragged my dad and husband to this place, trying to convince them that there's nothing wrong with foreign food, you know, sometimes you have relatives whose taste buds aren't as adventurous as yours. I made believers out of them.",1
trn_128,"When I ate steak this was the place to go for a decent - consistent - reasonable price point Steak.

Although a chain - it doesn't have that generic chain quality to the food.

I have gone to many steak places (some very expensive) - and found myself realizing that the expensive steaks didn't even really compare to The Keg.

a) excellent steaks
b) good price-point for the food
c) good ceasar salad
d) yummy garlic mash potatoes
e) Kegsize drinks are good value (but don't drink and drive - as the Kegsize is bigger than the average pour)
f) good overall place for date/celebration/friends/intimate/business etc.
g) all Keg's are consistent in the sense it doesn't matter which one you go to - it is generally the same good experience in the food and friendly staff

I have always found The Keg every bit as good - if not better than some of the most expensive Steak places in Toronto.",1

The burger was amazing!! And the sliders... Yum! Only thing I can complain about is the service. Our food took at least an hour to come out, but I would give this place 5 stars anyways because of the food quality and taste. I think they may have just had an off day or had someone call in...? This place is a bit expensive, but a MUST TRY if you are walking around the Vegas Strip!",1

Another great feature is the cosmetics floor.  I use the Dior Black Mascara and they always have it, best part is the are also up to date with all the lines of cosmetics.  You will find other notable brands - Chanel, Lancôme, Urban Decay, MAC  and more.

trn_132,"I read some of the old reviews sporting some hefty criticism and it seems that the Asians owner do take heed at some of the remarks on Yelp for my Poutine was made with insanely hot gravy. In fact, I had to sit out 3-4 minutes for it to cool down.

The portions are generous. That family size (to be shared... or not... if you wish to have a heart attack in your 30s), is a generous quantity for the low price of 11$+tax. The steamed hot dogs all dressed, 1.09$+tax each. The fries are pretty good, the cheese is typical Poutine cheese curds although the gravy seems somewhat tasteless. 

This isn't the best tasting food but it certainly is far from the worst. I'd place it above average but Belle Province, as far as I can remember, since my childhood, was never really about the quality but about the [(quantity+(quality/3)]/price. Yes, that's my mathematical equation for Belle Pro standards. Discounting all-you-can-eat buffets, I'd say Belle Pro gives out the best quantity/price output in the West Island. So, if you're not afraid of carbs (or if you're feeling up for your arteries to be clogged with cholesterol), this is one of the best places to have a decent snack on a budget in the West.

The place is surprisingly clean and the owners are pretty friendly. Service was quick.

P.S. A warning to the ladies. I've heard rumors of certain Paki employees sleazily flirting with girls. It happened to one of my friends, and, apparently, others before her.",0
trn_133,"Short review: Great food, decent price, good atmosphere, unique. 

We came in late on a Sunday night (around 8:15 PM). The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. The twist on grilled cheese was more than satisfying. I had what was a grilled cheese take on a ""philly"" called an ""Arsenio Hall"" and it was the best philly I have ever had. I had it on sour dough bread without mushrooms and every bite of the sandwich was delicious. The crispy toast and completely melted cheese were better than I would have expected. 

She had the ""Nick Saban with bacon"" on sour dough and her sandwich was comparably good. The spicy aioli was particularly well matched for her 'wich but I think we both prefered the Arsenio Hall. Again the bread and cheese were perfectly cooked and really high quality. 

Also, they have a decent beer selection (all bottles or cans to draft). The atmosphere was also nice with lots on the walls.",1
trn_134,I put a lot I miles on my 96 R110RS and I always swing by other dealerships on my road trips. The customer service from the entire staff is unmatched by any other dealer. I really enjoy stopping by to look at all the new bikes and riding gear. I especially like the service I receive from Miller in the service department because he never treats me like I'm an idiot and really wants me to come back. I will definitely buy my next BMW from this dealership.,1

I already had one of their candles at home that I had bought at the Gilbert Farmer's Market so I knew I loved them.  I ended up buying a larger candle in a different scent.  I also bought a beautiful necklace from Adam Rabbit.  Each designer/artisan takes turns working in the store, so it's a true team effort to run it.

trn_140,"Very Happy I did business here.
This review is long overdue, but what this company/location does is very rare in the buy-here/pay-here business.  
I purchased an '04 Jeep Liberty in Nov. of 2011.  Before I signed on the line, Lou invited me back to his office and told me about how the whole thing works and why he does what he does.  And even then I thought ""Well, he could just be a very good actor.. so we'll see"".  And I did see.  The guy is for real and he does what he says he will do.
Back then they were offering oil changes almost at cost for as long as you were making payments (not sure what they do now), and I also had a couple of minor repairs done at way below the average dealer pricing.  The record keeping was impeccable, which is also rare in the 'buy-here/pay-here' market.  But because my work schedule is so hectic, and because I like to pay cars off as quickly as possible, I sometimes just have to call from the road to see where I stand.  I could call at any time and in a matter of seconds had my last payment, what was owed, total interest paid, etc.  And when it was all done (about 18 mos. later) They sent my title (Which is another thing you have to watch out for in this business, because sometimes it's not so easy with other dealerships) and I just kept on driving.
I've had the car now for nearly 4 years, and put about 100k miles on it (I do a lot of business on the road) and it's still humming along, getting about 20 mpg on average, and better on long trips.
So now it's about time to start shopping for another car again and can tell you... if I were back in Vegas I'd happily do business here again.",1

Staff is always walking around making sure everything is going well and asking if we were okay. The kids spent almost 4 hours running around and having fun. I was able to enjoy a message on the massage chairs. Have to say that made my experience a little better. After the kids ran around I was able to find a nice snack pack for them to enjoy which included juice, gold fish, raisins, a tangerine, and cheese. It was only $2.75 and my son loves everything in it. Only thing that was a little frustrating was the bathrooms. My 7 month old nephew needed a diaper change and there is only 1 changing table and it took a while for us to be able to get to the 1 bathroom with the 1 changing table maybe a changing tabke in each of the 3 bathrooms would be better. Even with that, however I can still give this business 5 stars. We will be back very soon!",1
trn_143,"A patient for the past three years, with biannual check ups.  Every time I leave after my appointment I ask myself why?  Without a doubt the most screwed up business I have ever seen.  The majority of the time their computer system is down and can not schedule a follow up appointment when I leave.  Their ""central"" appointment center is a disaster.  I was on hold for over an hour and then before my call was answered, they closed!  The latest is I need a surgical clearance from CVC before I can have out patient surgery for a deviated septum.  Four trips to CVC over the past week and now their doctor wants a stress test.  They have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now.  Assuming I can ever get resolution for my surgical clearance it will be the last time I deal with this entity.",-1

trn_145,"This place was so fun ! Came early evening on a Friday night. We were told if we didn't have a reservation we wouldn't have a table so make sure you make one ! There is of course standing room but its more fun with a table and easier to drink your massive drinks. 

We opted for the volcano bowl first which was celebrated by chanting over the loud speakers. The bowl is for four people but we easily finished just the two of us. I also had the navy grog. All of the drinks taste much different than the sugary cocktails we are used to so keep an open mind. 

Service was excellent. Our server made recommendations for drink choices and was super friendly and funny. Drinks are on the pricier side however completely worth it given the amount of alcohol in them.",1
trn_146,"This is where I discovered my love of Chili Chicken. The soup here is great, prices are decent for what you get. But dried chili chicken with the sauce on the side is amazing. The deep fried fish was really great. The portions are huge. Definitely wouldn't over do the ordering as I've had so much leftover to take out every time...But I'm not complaining. 

The place has been turned into Hakka Legend but it definitely still has the same feel and people working there. 

Definitely my new go to place after work when I want some comfort food.",1

Sadly, I cannot give it more than 2 because the BEER sucks. When it comes down to it, this is a bar, and any time I come here, I'll have breakfast and tea, but won't touch the beer. If you're lucky, about the best beer you can find is something from Mill Street. I made the mistake once of ordering a draft macro lager and it was disgusting. I like good beer, so it was a mistake to order that in the first place, but damn this beer was skunky. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. And that's too bad, because when I come to watch a match, I'm there for 2-3 hours and I'd consume a generous amount of beer, if it tasted good. Could you not stock some bottles of some decent beer rather than the swill that you're serving. I'd imagine that some of your clientele would appreciate it. Those that don't have plenty of macro lagers to choose from.",-1

trn_156,"WHY we liked this place so much remains a mystery...it doesn't really fit into our typical dining template with the noise, and the beer, and the noise. However, we loved our experience here. 

I had pretzel-crusted chicken and boyfriend had the meatloaf, and we were very happy not only with the food, but with the **value**. That is, you get a lot of bang for your buck here. Lots of food, delicious mashed taters, and I received TWO tasty slabs o' chicken, such that I had to take one of the breasts home. 

The atmosphere is actually really beautiful too; gleaming wood everywhere, a three-tiered dining area, lots of windows, a huge, old timey bar, and interior windows so you could see their little beer silo situation. 

The only lackluster part of the experience were the lackluster teenagers manning the Host booth. They seemed very confused about life. It's also very loud in here but if you come early enough, people aren't quite drunk yet.

Me and my boyfriend got our food and drinks, great view.. Then he noticed a huge spider inside, and so the windows went up.. Then there was one on my side, inside and we killed it. Then a huge one across the front windows again... We got so hot we had to open the windows for a cross breeze (it was a beautiful night!) and the huge spider from before was in my car, again we sadly killed it..  Then 5 minutes later the biggest one yet was outside my drivers seat window, it was too much and we left after that. So unfortunate. I'm not sure if it's a problem, or where we were parked but everyone around us had their windows and doors open.. I still have the heebie jeebies. Maybe it was the wrong time of year for us..

Well, with you bad service plus most of my order is for take out! Why I need to tip you as 10% of my total bill? Also, there has no law request a min. Of 10% tip!

Really bad service plus so so food! I think there store manager need to training their waitress again before they service customer!",-1

The first time we enjoyed:
The soup dumpling (many tasty ingredients)  Really good!
Thousand layer cake (the spice left a wonderful taste in your mouth)
The other four dim sum were adequate.  The congee was rather bland.

Nevertheless, for just the first two items and the general atmosphere, we returned within eight days.

What a disappointment!
The soup dumpling not the same at all.  The majority of the ingredients were gone and it was thin and watery and we paid $5 each.
The spice was gone from the thousand layer cake, and while still reasonably tasty, it was not worth the money.

We were surprised the food quality went down so quickly and will not return.

We have been going to Graceful Vegetarian (Market Village) for many years.  It's quality is not spectacular like Wu Tai was the first time we went, but we can always count on Graceful to be consistent.",0

trn_172,"i recently obtained an 80's nishiki road bike from my mom that had been collected dust in her garage since the 80's. a good tune up and some new tires were in order for my vintage gem of a road bike.

i took it to hoodride first, via recommendation from a friend, and was charged $45 for new tubes and a tune up. what i got were new tubes that encountered a splinter within weeks and required a completely new tube. a tune up that was promised was negligent as the bike didn't seem to ride right and didn't even look clean.

so after a careful yelp search i happened upon trailheads, and brought my bike in to have them check it out. they put my bike up and checked it out to see what i needed to get it back in rideable shape. turns out there was a ton of gunk in my gears and the tires were not trued and the spokes were loose. they offered to replace both my tires and tubes with thorn-resistant ones. i brought the bike in around noon that day, opted for their ""silver"" tune up package, which they bunked a few bucks off of due to my debacle with hoodride. my bike was ready by 5pm that day.

after i picked it up, i noticed my chain was still rubbing and making a strange noise. i had a friend who specializes in road bikes look at it, and adjusted my gear shifters that solved the problem. kind of disappointed they didn't catch this, but overall, i was very satisfied with the service i received. and they make a mean cappucino.",1

trn_175,"I wonder if I was at a different restaurant than some of the other reviewers because it was NOT a 24 hour cafe.  
My husband and I just returned from Vegas and dined there on our last night in town.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess was gracious and seated us right away.  We had a lovely view of the restaurant and were treated to the sounds of a singer  and piano wafting in from the bar.  The decor was quite swanky and we were pleasantly surprised to find there was no casino in the building.
The waiter immediately brought menus and took our drink orders.  We pondered the offerings and finally settled on a rabbit and tortellini appetizer to share, salads and then went over the main menu selections.  While there was not a long list to chose from, all of the offerings sounded good.  I ordered a double pork chop, braised cabbage with bacon and whipped sweet potatoes.  Hubby went with the beef tenderloin, fingerling potatoes and asparagus.  We were not disappointed.  The meal was awesome! I seriously believe it was the best pork chop I have ever eaten.  We were so impressed that the waiter brought out the chef to meet us.
The wait staff was very attentive.  My water never got half empty and they were so polite.  While the dinner, with 4 cocktails and no dessert cost close to $200, in my mind it was well worth it.  We have a great memory of Las Vegas and had a real dining experience.   We will surely go again when we return to Sin City.",1

When we showed up there was a band playing, that was loud on the outside and when we got in, had to shout to the guy at the door 3-4 times about getting in, that there was a $4 cover ($8 for the both of us).  I COULD NOT HEAR THE GUY A FOOT AWAY. I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING. I left. I'm not paying extra to go deaf and I'd like to talk to the person I go with.  I wouldn't mind the cover if the band was playing at a volume that didn't cause instant ear damage. We are 20-somethings, I love metal, rock and rap so loud music is normally not a problem.  But if you actually wanted to listen to the bad, stand outside.
Happy Dog, you missed out on a $30+ check from booze and food because your band was too loud and you wanted to charge us to go deaf.  Your establishment is too small to necessitate amps, or at least don't let the band turn it up so loud. Your place is small, you don't need it that loud.

We went to the Melt instead and it was fantastic.

I will rate you guys again next time I visit and that rating will be about food and service.  This one was about how I was unable to eat here.",-1

trn_178,"My bf rented a VERSA for 48hrs/2days because his main car broke down and he needed a car to get to work, the quote was $44.  He declined everything that was offered. He specifically refused insurance because his would cover it. When he returned the car, he was charged $111. THEY ADDED INSURANCE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT at $25.99 per day.  Representative that helped him was ""Devry"", (at least that's what he said his name was) 

Never doing business with them again. Why do they do ""Bait & Switch""??!?!! This is so wrong!",-1

He is certified in chiropractic sports medicine and he definitely knows what he is doing/talking about.  Dr Frankie takes the time to listen to you and provide outstanding adjustments,  always followed by ideas/techniques for at home stretching/care.  He has helped me though a back injury and multiple other ailments from being an athlete.  I have seen multiple chiropractors over the years and no one compares to Dr Frankie!  I believe in him so much that i drive 20 minutes one way to get my adjustments from him, even thought there is another  LSM chiropractor 1 mile away.",1

Some of our favorites include: chocolate covered pretzels, chocolate covered oreos, mint melt aways, and just the plain old foil wrapped chocolate (hearts and eggs at Valentine's Day and Easter).  If you have not tried it, please do!  You will not be disappointed!  And now that I live out of the state, I can still enjoy with online ordering :)",1

trn_182,"Came here on mother's day, so we were expecting a crazy wait time, but we were seated within 5 minutes. Denise, our waitress, was super attentive, and immediately came out and gave our dog a bowl of water as we sat down. After we ordered our meals, she let us know that the kitchen was a little behind since they were so busy, but she made sure our food was being prepared as quickly as possible. We didn't mind at all actually, it was a holiday and the restaurant was packed, but we appreciated Denise letting us know that she hadn't forgotten about our order. The food was great, and afterwards the manager Rachel came over to our table to apologize for the wait (which really was no big deal), and gave us a free appetizer card for next time. Both Denise and Rachel provided exceptional customer service, and we will always return and request for Denise to serve us. Thank you both for your awesome service!",1
trn_183,"Fast, friendly, and the driver did the heavy lifting on my bag with a smile! That is service worth tipping well for and will always bring me back.  I love that they know where you parked and take you directly to your car and the bottled water is a really nice added touch.",1
trn_184,"Tremont Animal Clinic has been great to me and my furbaby, Lola.  They are friendly and accommodating when making appointments and have ""after-work"" hours that make it easy to bring my dog in without missing anything at work.  

The location is easy to find and has plenty of parking.  Quickly after checking in, you and your pet are put into a private exam room while you wait for your vet.  Our veterinarian, Dr. Kelly, was so friendly and patient with my Lola.  She took some time to let my dog sniff her, kiss her, and jump on her a bit, before getting started.  

She and her vet tech helped keep my anxious pup in place and calm while she was examined.  She addressed my concerns with professionalism and reassurance.  

Checkout was prompt and easy.  They also keep a nice stock of medicines, including heartworm and flea/tick medicine, so you can stock up.  They also responded quickly (the next day after my appointment-- I was the last appointment of the day) with the results of her fecal sample.

Luckily, my Lola dog hasn't had to visit them for anything outside of a check-up and vaccinations, but if that day comes, I'll know I'm in good hands with TAC.",1

trn_189,"First timer. Lunch. It's kinda like a Greek ""Chipotle."" (And I love Chipotle.) The customer line was long, but they moved it along at a good clip. The staff was efficient and a little friendlier than most fast food places of the sort. And they had drafts! (May not be for every lunch, but it's a nice amenity.) 

The food was good, really good for the price, and the staff acted like they own the place (in a good way).",1

The chicken and avocado was forgettable. The seafood fettucine was bad- watery and bland. They did put enough seafood in though. 2 stars for the food. That is to say i would've given this place if it were a $10/person type of place. But it's not. The service was nauseatingly slow too.",-1

trn_193,"My mother ordered a gift basket for my brother's birthday from the Rock Hill location on 9/16 to be picked up on 9/17. She spoke Corey who assured her that they would order it and have it ready. Her checking account was immediately debited. My brother was to pick it up at 1:00pm on 9/17. My mother called around noon to confirm. She spoke with Hannah who had no record of the order and wasn't able to look because she had a line of customers. She told my mother that she would call this store as it is the main office. My mother called you as well after never hearing back from Hannah. She told them that she didn't get the basket and asked for a manager. The girl said the manager was there and she went to get him on the phone. Mysteriously, when the girl returned to the phone, the manager wasn't at the store and never had been. Still no one called back. My mother called both Rock Hill and Charlotte again. No one knew anything. Nim, who identified himself as some kind of manager at the Charlotte location but not the kind that could help her, said that he would refund the money by 8:00pm on 9/17 and that he would make sure a manager called her on Monday. Here it is on Monday, and not only has no manager ever called her back but more importantly, she has yet to receive a refund. My mother called your location again and no manager. The guy who answered said a manager would be back at 5pm and would call her. No call. My mother called Rock Hill back. Hannah tells us that there isn't even a manager in Rock Hill but she would text the Charlotte manager. Hannah came up with a ticket saying my mother's refund was processed and it would be a few days. Of course, my brother's birthday has come and gone. Thank you for not only making the birthday stressful and disappointing but also lying repeatedly to my 62 year old mother.",-1

The store owner was helpful in trying to rectify my complaint, advising that the vase my mom chose was not good for the flowers and that she would b pleased to create an arrangement suited to that vase. Nonetheless, the sparse arrangement originally sent was not at all what you would expect for the money spent. Picture to follow.",-1

trn_200,Came in for the special tonight --- sesame crusted ahi tuna with avocado wasabi dressing.  Absolutely the best!!

trn_201,"I don't see the need normally to review a grocery store but this one needs dire help.
I've lived in Lakewood for several years now and always tell myself I'm never going back to Marc's anytime I step in there. I normally like Marc's but the Lakewood location is godawful. 
First off the parking lot here is A NIGHTMARE! I can't tell you how many times I've almost got hit in the lot. There's several blind spots when turning out of aisles. 
The aisles in this store are very narrow, the store itself is grungy, and the only staff is either 15 or 115 so take your pick. 
They do NOT take cards except for Discover so prepare to wait behind grandma writing out a check, counting out pennies, or making a trip over to the atm. I believe this is one of the reason check out here is extremely slow. There aren't any belts to load your food on but there's a tiny counter top that can only fit about 2 gallons of milk and a bag of potatoes so you can't load any of your groceries to be rang out until the person in front of you is done. I also suggest to bring your own bags. The bags here are as thin as tissue paper.
Most of the time I've came in here was to grab 1 item and end up getting frustrated trying to find it or loose my patience in line and end up leaving. I can only compare this store to the steel yard wal-mart. If you are from this area you will understand the comparison.
I recommend NOT coming here after 4pm or around the 1st of the month. You will regret it!",-1

They cut them down, Sweetie had a bit of hair hanging down and Ginnie's tail is so long and beautiful.  I love the service, however, it is a bit impersonal, but at this rate, I'm ok with that.  The price is very competitive, my dogs never seem traumatized like at some places, I could tell my dogs were super anxious, never at Barking Broadway.  They are always happy when they leave.  One suggestion, is front desk should make follow-up appt. for next 6 weeks so it's on calendar, yes I know that I'm being lazy, but that's what accounted for them not coming for some months (yes, my fault again) it would be very helpful.  I would recommend to anyone with dogs who need regular grooming.",1

I had waffles which wasn't worth it with the sausage and eggs. I only like my blueberry muffin. It was delicious but luckily I got it for free bc I ""checked in"" on yelp. Take my mix drink out.

Second morning I called and tried to order take out but the woman said that you have to come in personally and order it from the bar.. I've NEVER heard or seen any restaurant do that. Get a credit card over the phone or whatever to ensure order. The whole point is to run in and pick up your food. If I wanted to wait I'd eat there?! Unfortunately when we got there it was a 30min wait and we had a flight to catch so we ordered to go. 
We both got omelettes, which I have to admit, they were the fluffiest I've ever had. Flavor could've been better with better quality fillings. The tomatoes in mine were really under ripe. I wanted to try the Dutch baby but was short on time since I needed to stand there while the food was being cooked. If I could've ordered in advance I totally would've tried it!
The servers, hostess and cashier were all kind of a hot mess. No smiles anywhere. It did seem really busy I admit but still.. pull it together people.. it's a breakfast place. Start the morning with a smile!",0
trn_211,"If you Haven't been here, go ASAP. it's a Phoenix staple.
I have been eating here since High School !!! Great local owners and they now have a 2nd Scottsdale location. YAY.
They have a tasting station at the front, so first timers can figure out what they like before committing to something.  Face it there is nothing like it anyplace. Chinese food fused with Mexican food, has proved to be a match in business and in love.
The Phoenix location has had pics of ""chino Kids"" for as long as I can remember and  the pics go back a long way so its a neat retrospective. Love it when somebody in their 20's+ says ""hey that's me "" and points at some kid on the wall.  
Go for the Jade red chicken , you can have it breaded or not. I have mine on salad in place of rice.  The jerk chicken and rice is another don't miss item. You can have anything put on a quesadilla if you would rather have portable food , just ASK ! 
An Awesome Phoenix and now Scottsdale institution",1
trn_212,"Below average.  Use to be good, but now they just toss stuff together.  Too much spice ( turmeric) in one dish.  The other dish -papaya salad tasted a few days old.

trn_213,Terrible experience. We went to the buffet around 4pm and were initially shocked by how few options they had under each food family. Also the food appeared to have been sitting out. We should have known better but we proceeded to eat there anyway. I had the worst food poisoning of my life after eating here. The next 24 hours were absolutely hell. I would recommend steering clear of this buffet and the Mirage in general.,-1
trn_214,"My husband and I went to the Waffle Shop for Sunday Brunch, which is your choice of 7 different types of waffles and nothing else. The whole experience was surreal and then there was the ""reality show"" aspect of it which seemed like the only normal part. 
This restaurant is obviously run by people who have no - I mean zero - experience in the restaurant business.  When we walked in we stood in front of the door while the servers sauntered around aimlessly, and the manager sat in the window talking to a friend (truth be told this is a familiar experience on the Pittsburgh Sunday Brunch scene, but still annoying). Finally a server came over to us and said that she would clean a table for us but then wandered off. After standing around for awhile longer our table was finally clean, we sat down we ordered coffee, waffles and OJs and waited some more. As I sat watching our server meander around the shop, she seemed to have no clue what she was doing. It all seemed very odd to me. When our waffles arrived from another server, our coffee and OJ hadn't. Soon after our waitress returned and stated, ""I'm sorry, I feel like I abandoned you guys."" And I couldn't help but agree. Our check was delivered by a third server. The first check we received was over-priced, we soon realized that this wasn't our check. We exchanged this check for our actual check and somehow our waitress had added our two $6.50 waffles, coffees and OJs to $10.70. I actually wondered if this was some part of the reality show experience - how you react when your server is a lost and bewildered individual (I'm trying to be kind with my words here). 
I'm guessing the whole experience is significantly more fun when you are drunk in the middle of the night. But, for a Sunday morning, I walked out of the restaurant saying to my husband, ""That was a weird experience!""",-1
trn_215,"If I could give them 12 stars, I would. This was the single most fantastic experience of my life. I was very apprehensive initially, because I couldn't tell if it was a gimmick or not, but as soon as we met our server, Anthony I knew it'd be a good time.

First and foremost, I think it's awesome that our server could tell we were nervous, and therefor tried to break the tension with comedy. He was actually one of my favorite parts of the night. I appreciate that they inquire about allergies, and went ahead and verified why derivations of my allergies were okay, if any. 

Walking in was terrifying, because you go from the light to nothingness. They cushion it with another room that's partially lit, but the absoluteness of darkness was jarring. 

Feeling around to try and discover what foods are what was so fun. Our server wouldn't tell us if we were right or not about what we were eating (except for once on accident) but that made it all the more fun when we got out to see what the menu is (sorry guys, no spoilers from me). They also change their menu every three months, so even though the website says they have sweet, savory, and spicy options, there's a new menu that is actually different now that's one menu for everyone (unless your allergens prevent it). 

I love that Anthony noticed when I didn't finish something because I didn't like it. And he was actually very worried that I wasn't going to get enough food and offered me more because I skipped a portion (it tasted fine, but I've some texture aversion issues and I couldn't get over the mouthfeel coupled with the fact that I had no clue what I was eating). 

You think the courses are too much, they're not. They're perfect! And a pallet cleanser comes in at the perfect time to change the pace. They did a really good job with this. You could sense the chemistry between the employees inside which was also enjoyable to listen to. PLUS, we got a special gift at the end! (I'm not sure if it always happens, or if it's because it's a holiday weekend)I will probably come here every time I visit Vegas just to see the new menu and have the experience again! 

Thanks so much guys!!!",1

trn_218,"I have a CRAZY confession to make.... I hate Whole Foods! I especially hate this Whole Foods. I don't get the love.. sorry people.

*Their salad bar SUCKS. Nothing is fresh and they don't carry any of the items I enjoy that other Whole Foods always have (ie the one on Charleston) such as Tomato/mozzerella salad or Chicken Caesar. Their cottage cheese is runny and gross.

*Prices.. ok I know they for some reason are justified in having markups, but honestly some of this is highway robbery. I adore Menage a Trois wine. I typically buy it at Smith's for between 6.99 and 8.99 a bottle. Why does Whole Foods charge 16.99 a bottle? WTF. I hate you Whole Foods

*Prepared food isn't that good! Pizza.. sucks.. (come on Settebello is in the same parking lot!), pasta.. awful and inedible. Sandwiches are just OK.. Just ok for these prices? come on. Sushi .. eww. Nothing is that good or worth eating at these prices. 

*I've found expired salsa on their shelves.. expired by a freaking YEAR. I know most grocery stores have issues, but that's pretty ridiculous.. check your shelves more than once a year when you're charging such obscene prices.

I just don't get it guys.. I think the organic trend is all fake anyways, but that being said I think wasting money on subpar food is ridiculous to me. Smith's, Trader Joe's.. don't worry, I won't waste my time at this craphole anymore.",-1

This Nook (while keeping the look and feel) is now owned by a Korean family and aside from their panini's, they serve Korean style lunch servings (lots of sides). Much like Est West, you have a range of sides to choose from (Kimchi, Green beans, pasta, etc) and a wide variety of soups and panini's.

Their food is pretty good for the standard $10 lunch price and they have a pretty good panini selection. Aside from a few service hiccups I'd say this is a pretty solid lunch spot on the King West line!",1

trn_222,"This food is soooo good! I love the Baja Mexican taste. Black beans, white rice, chipotle cream sauce. The especial burrito. The chicken tacos. The sangria. 

My go-to's are the chicken especial burritos and the two classic chicken taco plate. The plate comes with chips and pinto beans. 

They have a signature chipotle cream sauce that I get every. single. time. I insist on trying it! 

I've also had great experiences with staff at this location. I had to wait a little while once and they gave me a free taco coupon and a free side of guac. I must say that when they don't give it to you for free, it is costly. It's $1.25 for a small (salsa side) guac. 

The salsa bar is amazing. They have a wide variety of salsas. Usually, by the time you are done filling up on salsa, your food is ready. It's awesome. 

5 stars in my opinion!",1

I started with the carnitas mac and cheese which was very tasty. I could have probably paired this with a salad to make a meal. My husband had the hot brown which he loved with all of the cheese and bacon. For my meal I had the sampler of all of the tacos. Each taco was delicious and unique. The pork belly taco was really good, smokey and crispy.",1

It was almost undrinkable.  I know it has won awards and many people rave about it, but unless you have some idea what you are dealing with, stay clear.

I skipped the Chinese food (didn't look much better than what I'd get at home) and loaded up on the seafood. I counted no less than five different fish dishes, in addition to the Alaskan king crab legs, and the sushi. The sushi was surprisingly quite good -- they also had a variety of other seafood/ocean dishes, like Japanese wakame salad and ceviche.

They also had Kobe beef and filet mignon and all kinds of other cuts of meat -- my guy commented that these weren't as good as the seafood, though. There was a wide selection of desserts, which we nibbled a little bit here and a little bit there at.

Just going here for the sheer spectacle of the buffet is worth the price tag.",1

trn_235,"I need to share my unfortunate experience at Sparklings so everyone is aware.
I visited Sparklings for the first time on 4/26/18. I sat at the bar and ordered wine and a few vegetarian appetizers, one of which was spinach and cheese ravioli (I am a vegetarian). When the food was brought out, it all looked good and I was excited to try it. I had a bite of the ravioli and immediately thought that something was wrong and indeed it was. They had brought shrimp ravioli to a vegetarian! So this was my very 1st time ever having shrimp. Not only was I furious about the kitchen mistake, but I also got an allergic reaction a few minutes after that bite! There was no managers at the restaurant. However, the bartender was very attentive and sincerely concerned which I appreciated. He took care of the check. I left, bought some benadryl from the nearby store and called it a night. Luckily for the restaurant, the allergic reaction was not bad, otherwise I would have taken legal actions. I will never go back!

+some constructive criticism... the place looks very nice but the bathrooms are disgusting! The food and wine selection is good but the wine list doesn't have info about the region and year of the wines (which is essential for a wine list). And again, train the kitchen staff to take food orders and dietary restrictions seriously.",-1
trn_236,"This place is great! We went on a Friday night and it was busy but since we were a party of 2, it went by fast for us. Our server was really cool and sweet to us. We ordered a root beer float, a beer, fish and chips, and a 10oz sirloin all for 40 dollars. Their fish and chips is super good, it's beer battered and has the perfect crunch to it. It was served with cold slaw and French fries but I substitute it for sweet potato fries instead. My bf said the steak had really good flavoring but it has a lot of gilet (which is hard pieces of meat), not the best steak ever. It came with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Overall, it's a great place to for chow down on bar food. It is a loud environment (hence bar) but there are a lot of TVs and a cool place to hang. Will come again!",1

trn_240,"Rating - 3.0/5.0

Went to check out the soft opening of Dear Fro which serves up korean style shaved ice and various other desserts/snacks.

The decor and space is well designed with an elegant upscale feel. The amount of detail they put into the walls, table tops to the lighting and floor tiles is quite remarkable for a simple dessert joint.

We ordered the classic injeomi bingsu to compare it against Snow Time.

In terms of the shaved ice, there are a couple key things that separate the two apart.

Texture: The shape of the shaved ice is almost like coconut flakes so it is definitely not as fine and fluffy. This comes down to personal preference but I prefer the fine and fluffy texture more. On the plus side, it doesn't melt as quickly as the finer shaved ice that you see at Snow Time.

Flavour: Here they pride themselves of using pure milk as their base versus a water base for their shaved ice. It is very milky and creamy but it lacks the layering of soy powder in between the shaved ice. As such, it comes off as a bit bland.

All in all, I would come back again to try their other items. However I still prefer the shaved ice at Snow Time and The Cups over Dear Fro.

They have a 10% off special right now as a soft opening promotion. Also for those who are interested, they are giving away 50 free bingsu desserts on October 21st and 22nd to the first customers to line up during their grand opening.

They are located right across from Snow Time so it will be interesting to see how that plays out.",0

After waiting nearly an hour for a check or refill, we managed to track him down chatting with a table of friends.

trn_242,"Very unique experience.  Not sure if it's authentic Mexican but sure feels like it.  The Al Pastor tacos are great!

You just go up to anywhere and order, no real line or semblance or a line.  The tacos are a little over $2 a piece and are small, so the price adds up quickly if you get 4 or more.

This used to be an Irish Pub, then a night club and now a Mexican joint.  The cool thing is that it kind of feels like all 3 elements are combined.  You eat Mexican soft tacos while sitting in a night club with Gaelic style woodworking.",0

Had to re-drill holes in the rail.  Now we have a rail with about 15 holes in it.  (They didn't make a new one, just drilled more holes.). The barn doors didn't meet in the middle.  The doors were not square.  Then trying to rectify all this, the main person we dealt with was condescending and rude.  We fixed them ourselves.  No reimbursement.

trn_248,"I came here with my colleagues on a Thursday night. We did the tasting menu which was $45 per person. It started off as a promising night but then things took a turn for the worse...

When I arrived I ordered the Fez Fig cocktail which to me tasted similar to a bourbon lemonade. It's definitely my kind of drink!! It contained figs, bourbon, Mahia (Moroccan spirit) and cardamom syrup. My boyfriend ordered the Marrakschi Mojito which tasted like mint tea. I liked it. It was very light and refreshing but you couldn't really taste the alcohol so my boyfriend didn't like his drink. Luckily our colleague liked it and took his cocktail. We then ordered a bottle of red Spanish wine (Conde Valdemar).

We were served a 5 appetizer platter which consisted of carrot salad, hummus, bell pepper salad, eggplant salad and a tomato cucumber salad. The carrot salad and the bell pepper salads were my favorite. It was so good! However, I didn't like the hummus and I usually love hummus! I also regret to say that I didn't like the eggplant salad because it had honey in it so it was sweet...think babaganouj but with honey. I'm sure people who like honey would enjoy this appetizer but I do not like it when my food is sweet. The tomato cucumber salad was simple and refreshing. It came with pita bread and a round loaf of bread. The pita bread was warm and thin and reminded me of a roti cut in triangles. It was so good my colleague ordered another round of pita bread for the table.

Then we were served a meatball tagine and a chicken tagine. The meatball tagine was pretty good. It was like something you could put on spaghetti. The chicken tagine was even better. It had tasty potatoes and olives. We ate the tagines with couscous. The sauce came separately and it made the couscous taste so much better.

Lastly, we had the mint tea and the dessert platter. The mint tea was not included in the tasting menu. I just love mint tea! The downside was that the waiter charged everyone $3.75 for the mint tea which individually seems reasonable but if I do the math it came out to almost $49 for the table for hot water and mint in three teapots! that's pricy!!

The dessert platter had three different types of dessert but the waitress didn't explain what it was. One resembled a lemon meringue pie but more bitter ( I did not like this one), the other one had pieces of brownie and lastly there was chocolate cake cut up in pieces. The latter was my favorite out of the three.

At the end of the meal we were given our bills. First of all, there was only one machine for the whole restaurant! They obviously need to get more cause it was long! Second, they charged us for bread but it was so random because some people did not get charged at all, whereas a colleague and I got charged $2 and another got charged $6!! How expensive was this pita bread?! Its nowhere on the menu. We thought it was included with the meal! We should have been informed at the beginning that it would cost extra. Lastly, the owner was rude when we told him that the bottles of chardonnay that he served normally cost $8.50/bottle at the SAQ. He was charging $60/bottle! I mean come on! That's a crazy markup! I don't normally check how much a bottle would cost at the SAQ but I tried the wine and I liked it but my boyfriend and I wanted to order red wine instead so my boyfriend looked it up online so that we could buy it at the SAQ later and drink it another time. This particular bottle wasn't even on the wine menu. It was a good Chardonnay though so if you are in the market for a cheap one get the Cesari Adesso Chardonnay 2014! Honestly I feel like the owner could have handled the situation better and it left a bitter taste in my mouth. We informed him so that in the future he could change the price because a wine connoisseur would know that it wasn't worth $60. There was a lot of back and forth and in the end two people were not charged for their bottle but the owner told them never to return to the restaurant again! The bottle of red wine that we ordered cost us $50 and it's $19.95 at the SAQ so that was reasonable. 

I would have given this restaurant four stars because I liked the drinks and I liked most of the food. The portions were a good size. Also the décor was elegant. However, I find it pricey for what we got and the unpleasant service and experience we had is making me give it 2 stars. They should really consider lowering the price and be nicer to their customers. I'm sorry to say that I would not come back.",-1

Anyway, I went for pho and was satisfied. A large order of rare steak and brisket pho is only $6.99 and although I haven't tried them yet, their sandwiches look amazing (and seemed very popular with the many to-go customers buzzing in and out while I ate), and on top of that, they have dried shredded chicken available for sale which I proudly pointed out to my boyfriend in the hopes he'll stop making fun of the large container of pork-fu in my kitchen cabinet.

I was quite disappointed cause it was dinner time for us. Lucky for us the owner of the place decided he make one cheese Quesadilla for my daughter. I totally understand their doing a special only but he was a kind soul to make one for her. Customer service was very good and the cashier ladies were nice. The second time I went was during the afternoon and it was fine,
we found seating and quesadillas was back on the menu. The taco is good, flavourful and the guacamole dipping sauce was a good amount of spicy. I kind of like the chicken taquitos but the chicken a bit dried. Overall this is a good place to take your family and the food are good.

But it's not just the food that makes this place great. It has an amazing vibe and great atmosphere. The drinks are tasty. The staff is friendly and efficient. But still with all the positives there is one thing that stood out the most. I'm very observant and I watched the manager (Josh) greet every table with a smile. Sincerely cared that the customers were happy. Made sure he made the experience personal not just a chore. When he approached our table made sure we has everything we needed, and that we were genuinely taken care of.

My pals put me in charge of finding somewhere to get a drink.  The pressure was on because we weren't impressed with the service at any of the downtown establishments thus far.  Toronto has this weird, Euro-hipster vibe that I am NOT a fan of.  Town Crier looked pretty low-key, so we walked inside.  The patio and downstairs were full, so the hostess took us upstairs.  There was 1 tiny table left.  We weren't excited about how cramped the seating was, so we offered to sit at the empty bar.  She said the bar wasn't really open for seating, but she'd make an exception for us.  She cleared away some towels and other stuff piled up at the bar.  It almost seemed like she felt bad that we had to sit there, but we were happy as pie.  The bartender/server (he was really both) working the bar was FANTASTIC.  He helped us choose beers (there are a million brands on tap), he gave us suggestions for stuff to do in Toronto, and he even took our picture for us...all while busting his butt keeping the drinks flowing for everyone in the room.   We had a blast.  We ended up sitting at the bar for hours laughing with the bartender and one other friendly server.  And at the end of the night, we couldn't believe how reasonable the bill was.  This was one of the best experiences I've had at a bar in a long time.  I would definitely return.  Maybe we'll try some food next time.",1

trn_268,"Executive Moving and Storage ""won our business"" after TWO walk-throughs (!) with a quote for $3,600, then tried to charge us $5,800 after loading the truck. This, despite the fact that we actually shipped fewer items that we showed on the walk-through. 

Before selecting Executive Moving and Storage, we got a dozen quotes from different moving companies. On average, they quoted $3,000-$4,000. 

We picked Executive after TWO Skype walk-throughs. During these walk-throughs I even used a tape measure to show the size of certain items. Executive quoted us $3,600. 

After the movers had loaded half of our household, they informed us that they didn't know they also had to pack our garage. What?! They seemed shocked, and then told us ""that would cost more"".

That's a lie, because we spent a fair amount of time in the garage during the walk throughs. I showed close-ups of my dumbbells, barbells, and weight plates, discussing the weight of each item (dumbbells, kettle bells, weight plates, etc.). Of course the weight is CLEARLY shown on each dumbbell, kettle bell and plate.

When the movers arrived, their manifest showed ""1"", as in ""1"" ""Gym Item"". So, the estimator obviously lied and manipulated the quotation so they could Bait and Switch and over-charge us. This is dishonest and apparently a common scam. 

There was absolutely ZERO confusion on the size of these items or exact weight. 

There were also several large, heavy items that we did NOT ship. A coffee table, outdoor dinner table, night stands, shelves, etc. Those items were included in the quote but we did not ship them. 

The sales rep, (had to take her name out because of 'privacy issue') made false promises and gave us an artificially low quote according to her boss, the customer service/dispatch girl. She told us on the phone that they made a mistake, that the Sales Rep gave us a quote that was too low. They wanted to charge us $5,800. Today, they offered to take $400, bringing the total to $5,400 after admitting their mistake. 

This of course is still $1,800 more than we were quoted. The customer service/dispatch girl left us on hold for 30 minutes today before speaking with us. Our shipment is supposed to arrive tomorrow. 

We asked Ashley on the phone today Ashley ""If you quoted us $3,500, and didn't even ship as much stuff as you originally planned/quoted, then why are you charging us $5,800 now?"". Ashley said ""We made a mistake"". 

We asked her what she would do about it. 

Ashley immediately hung up on us. Seriously????

Clearly we are only going to pay the amount originally quoted, at total of $3,500. They already have our deposit. 

We will post an update as soon as this is resolved. They have not called us back after hanging up on us. Phone calls go to voicemail. 

Call us back, Ashley. 

My Desired Resolution:
We are willing to pay the amount originally quoted. 

We also filed a complaint through the Better Business Bureau. We weren't the first. 

Advice for Ashley and Executuve: You have the opportunity to do the right thing, and change the way you do business. I will update this review after this is handled. How hard is it to just be honest these days? 


Executive Moving is now HOLDING OUR THINGS HOSTAGE until we pay the inflated rate of $5800+ after the initial $3500 quote. Both Nancie and Ashley are aware that I have a PREMATURE BABY that just got out of the NICU after 3 weeks, who needs her things out of the moving truck and are INTENTIONALLY PREVENTING me from accessing our things! I am literally CRYING MY EYES OUT and SCARED FOR my BABY in front of my house! All this after we've already paid them $2k+ and want to close out our invoice for the $3500 total. But it being Saturday and a Jewish holiday, we are unable to even get a hold of the company or speak to anyone to resolve this.

The kicker is that after the movers picked up our things, they gave us the new $5800 quote I asked them to get our things off the truck because I was not paying the higher amount. The foreman, Casey with West Coast Moving, stated it was OK for us to work out the price after the fact. So I called and emailed Nancie Wilson and she said that she and Ashley were appalled and shocked at the inflated rate and that she will work on it ASAP. Unfortunately, all of this was lies because Ashley then called back and said we owe he full amount. That we had more items (charging us 3 items per 1 item ie: 1 bed=1 headboard, 1 footboard, base, etc). They also put down ""1 gym"" after we showed them 50+ items that included Dumbbells, bench press, squat rack, etc. all this after Nancie AND Sara at Executive Moving did a VISUAL evaluation of the garage and DIDNT LIST ITEMS THEY SAW.

So unless you want to work with SCAM ARTISTS, DO NOT even think about using Executive Movers!!! They will RIP YOU OFF and HOLD YOUR THINGS HOSTAGE until you pay them. This was the BIGGEST MISTAKE we made with our move. Talk about ANXIETY and PANIC ATTACKS after dealing with these CRIMINALS!!!",-1

trn_271,"I had passed by this place a million times and was always curious.  A few weekends ago I finally gave into curiosity.  Meh!

What is about the chicken joints in this part of the city NOT being able to give you what is on the menu when you order the combo?  Or being able to clearly communicate in English why you are not getting what is being advertised?  Worst yet, they charge the full price and do not offer anything extra.  

Fries were frozen (to be expected) and the chicken was sitting under a lamp.  Tasty but very far from the best fried chicken I've had.  No biscuit/bread.

The worst part was that it was all served on a single paper plate.  The grease soaked through and I was essentially eating off of the plastic tray.

Really can't recommend this one.  I suspect it survives from teens coming here after school or maybe a lunch crowd.  If you absolutely need to settle a fried chicken craving, live nearby and only order the chicken then I suppose it OK.  Otherwise you are better off skipping this joint.",-1

But, that is totally okay as the meat is the real star here. We tried four options, and we agreed that we both liked the brisket the most. Pulled pork and chicken were tasty as well.

He immediately contacted me about my issue and seemed very sincere about wanting to make certain that I recognized that they have no desire to leave a customer feeling taken advantage of.  And I DID feel his sincerity.  He wanted to have his GM come out to look at the repairs done by his competitor but when I didn't take him up on that, he had his assistant call me and INSIST on sending me the $100 that I'd paid elsewhere.  I surely didn't expect that.  It was a very generous offer.  

Although I still feel that the circumstances were odd revolving around the cost for a new drain pan being exorbitant, I feel that this company does prioritize making things right.  Just like any company you use or product/service you purchase, do your due diligence.  But all and all I am walking away feeling a lot better about Rescue One Air.

Thanks again for being so concerned about my situation and making me feel good again about your company.",0
trn_285,"I really have some expectation for this place after knowing this dessert place is from Hong Kong.  So my friend, hubby and I wanna give it a try on the 2nd day of its soft opening.  Sorry that I must say it's really bad.  All of us ordered traditional Chinese dessert to give it a test-Black sesame walnut sweet soup with dumplings, walnut almond sweet soup & black sesame red bean sweet soup.  Here's our comments:

-hot dessert should be hot not room temp
-black sesame doesn't has its aroma, bitter in taste
-red bean soup and almond soup were watery.  Almond soup same as black sesame doesn't has almond taste at all.  Even the instant almond drink I have daily taste a lot better.
-Dumpling seems like undercooked, hard inside.
-no water being served (actually included us, there were only 3 tables, so no excuse being busy)

According to my hubby, he saw some desserts were reheat by microwave.  

The only thing we like it's the decor.....

One of the waitress asked us for comment and we did tell her the truth.  She told us another customer also complained the dessert not hot.  We received a $10 cash coupon valid till Feb 12, but do u think I will go again??",-1
trn_286,"This place is a seafood dream come true. This was my first time coming here and I tried as many things as I could.  We came when it was between lunch and dinner so there wasn't that many people there.  The waitress that sat us was friendly and funny.

We started off with frog legs and alligator tail. These were battered and fried and the basket version is served with fries.  The frog legs were big and cooked just right. It wasn't dry like others I have tasted.  The alligator tail was also cooked right. I would have liked them to be chopped up in a different shape than bite size squares, but thats just a quirk of mine. I also should have ordered something different than ranch dressing to dip in.

For the main course, We ordered the $69.95 platter that consisted of lobster, crawfish, clams, and shrimps. We also ordered 1 additional Dungeness crab. This was sauced with their Louisiana style sauce, medium heat so not too spicy.  When I opened up the lobster it was like Christmas for me! It had the orange roe and the gooey fat that I love! It was so fat and sweet, I wish I had another! The crawfish too were big and juicy. We didn't intensionally order the clams, we actually ordered mussels. But that mistake was fine because that was good too and cooked just right.  The crab was somewhat disappointing because it wasn't as fat as I anticipated but the meat was sweet and delicious. The shrimp were okay, a little overcooked but that was mainly for my friend who didn't really like crawfish that much. If it wasn't for the crab, I would have given this place 5 stars. But I will back again, maybe they will get that 5 star then.",1

trn_293,We asked for a refund within 15 minutes of arriving. which I've never had to do before. The crab legs were so tiny and cold you couldn't get the meat out even though they were cut in half. Each station had very little selection and what they did have wasn't appealing. They couldn't get wood fired pizza right. Prime rib was tough. For the 36.00 per person it wasn't even close to being worth it. Don't bother or waste your money here.,-1

They have a lot of unique toppings as well that I havent seen anywhere else. The food is filling and great for its price. Most items are under 20$.

The atmosphere is beautiful. Very euro artsy. Nice decor. Quite spacious so it's very quiet. During the summers you can sit at the patio.

Only downfall is sometimes theyre too rushed. When we were deciding what to eat they kept coming back, atleast 2-3 times every 5 minutes. I also have to remind them twice to give me some extra water.",1
trn_296,"This place has got it together. I was clearly leading with my stomach when I walked in here during lunch rush, the line was sooooooo long, literally about 20 people deep. I considered walking out but took a chance and toughed it out. I only waited about 5 minutes! 

Everyone in the line was so quick, but very courteous and made everything to order. Everyone was smiling and having a great time, while being super busy! One staff member was in training! The menu options are great.
The ingredients are fresh and delicious.

It is a small strip mall type store so very small and vanilla inside.  The food this go round was decent but some of it was a bit off.  I had the general tso chicken which was very good (5/5) but the fried rice did not taste as fresh as before and could have used more soy sauce to up the saltiness (2/5) and the egg roll was not good (1/5) the cabbage tasted too raw and so it was too cabbage tasting as a result.

trn_302,"I went to the Women's Imaging for a routine Mammogram.  It was that time, my doctor said and I dread these exams.  Who really likes their body parts being smashed?  Not me.

I arrived at for my 11:15 am appointment about 40 minutes early.  The first lady that greeted me was very nice and within a couple minutes, Brenda called me to go over insurance and other information she needed.  Brenda was very nice, personable, asking how to say my middle name which was a Chinese name.  I was hesitant to share because most people that don't speak Chinese always butcher it.

Brenda did butcher my name, but she didn't know and she was so nice, so I didn't care.  Within 10 minutes or so, I got called to go with Beth who would be my technician for the mammogram.  Unfortunately I was on the phone and didn't hear all her instructions to me.  I know, how rude of me, but I really needed to answer the call.

Anyway, Beth was very sensitive to me as this is somewhat of a sensitive exam.  She didn't make this mammogram as painful as prior mammograms I had, so that was a huge plus.

And, I was finished and dressed, out the door by 11:14 am, right before my scheduled appointment.  I really LOVE when I don't have a long wait time.

I was treated well by every single person I came in contact with, a couple other people I don't know their names.  They respected my time and glad everything went smoothly.  My thoughts on Mammograms now are they aren't that bad.

Thanks for making this a good experience for me and respecting my time.",1

trn_304,"Ever since V2 at First Markham Place closed down (which was many years ago!), this has become our go-to place for wonton noodles. A number of wonton noodle shops have popped up since, but none of them beats Jim Chai Kee in my opinion. 

The speed of service is quite impressive and reminds me of eateries in Hong Kong. Typically, our order includes a plate of vegetables with oyster sauce ($2.5), which arrives within a minute or two from the time we order. The noodles come shortly after, and we are usually done our meal within 30 to 45 minutes. The broth is clear, light yet full of flavour and always comes pipping hot. The restaurant fills the bowls with soup only 3/4 of the way to avoid overcooking the noodles. In traditional establishments (these are even hard to find in Hong Kong now), wonton noodles are served with a spoon at the bottom of a small bowl, stacked with wontons, and finally topped with noodles to avoid soaking it in the soup for too long. 

There are only 3 toppings available (wontons, sliced beef and dace fish balls) and you can mix and match as you wish ($8 for all 3 toppings, $7 for 2 toppings and $6 for 1 topping). Because the menu is small and concise, the quality is always consistent. I definitely prefer this place over Wonton Chai (Unionville location) as I find that their toppings and broth tend to be on the salty side. Plus, the wontons just aren't as good. As for Wonton Hut (Warden and Hwy 7), I do enjoy their broth, although I find their portions really small and their price points are slightly higher. 

A few things to keep in mind when visiting:
- This place only accepts cash and you will need to bring your bill up to the counter.
- There is a self-serving tea station in the back right corner.
- Uncooked wontons and fish balls are available for sale.",1

It was nice to feel at home again with the brickwork, stairs and small comfortable setting. The windows are lovely, looking out over downtown phoenix. The owner was great, really friendly and welcomed us right away. Wasn't that busy on a tuesday night. It was very casual and laid back but very beautiful in its design. The music was good, not too loud or obnoxious and the lighting was wonderful. Full bar with a lot of selections, except for Sailor Jerry's which my friend was dissappointed over, but still had a pretty decent list of specials. Overall I say it's a really good bar and I will frequent it quite often, it's much cleaner than Bikini.",1
trn_306,Best ice cream shop in Cleveland! They have everything from ice cream to sodas to candy to popcorn. I highly recommend getting the shoreway sundae it's always my go to. Great place to go after a dinner with friends. It gets crowded towards the end of the night but somehow I'm always able to find seats despite the fact it's a tiny place. The staff is friendly and they will get you anything you need. It's a nice touch to the west side.,1

trn_308,"We went in for a late breakfast, it was around noon I guess. They were way friendly and the place was calm. I ordered the creme brulee french toast with bacon. The bacon was good. The french toast was... well, it was 2 slices of basic french toast on my plate just as it would be anywhere else. It had a little pile of chopped, stewed apple and pears which was take it or leave it good. My sweet tea was tasty though. He got the central breakfast; ordering his eggs over medium, sausage patties, wheat toast and morning fries with up-charged country gravy over them. His eggs arrived super well done and charred on the edges. He likes to bust the runny yolks with a corner of his toast, but as he stabbed at all three eggs on his plate, none of them burst due to them all being so overcooked.  It was at this point that I noticed there was no butter on his toast either, just 2 pieces of dry wheat bread on his plate. He sent the eggs back and continued to eat his sausage and morning fries with up-charged country gravy. The waitress comes back to the table and asks ""over medium or over easy?"" He again tells her, ""over medium... runny yellows."" Just as he's finishing his food the second order of over medium eggs arrives. This time one of them is slightly runny so he ate that one and left the other two that were again very overcooked. When the waitress brought us our check she said, ""we didn't charge you for the country gravy since your eggs were wrong twice..."" This really made me mad. She as the waitress is supposed to be sure that our order is correct, and she knowingly gave him over cooked eggs twice! 

Our bill was $27 and some change. basically we had 3 pieces of toast, 2 sausage patties, 3 pieces of bacon, syrup, 1 egg, morning fries, country gravy and 2 sweet teas... I don't feel like I spent my money wisely today. For $27 and some change I could have gotten steak and lobster. 

I did not tip the waitress based solely on her comment about the eggs being wrong twice. It pissed me off that she gave food to us twice that was wrong. 

Oh well, another rehabbed, over priced place for the yuppies to hang out and waste money in. We won't be back.",-1
trn_309,"I've been here twice now for lunch.  First time I got a double burger, fried pickles, and a root beer float.  The float was delicious.  The fried pickles were very tasty, though quite salty, and the burger was not very good.  The meat was ground very fine and tasted like some sort of weird meatloaf.  Generally when meat is ground that fine it makes me wonder what is in it that they're trying to hide.

Today I stayed away from the burger.  I had a veggie burger, a grilled chicken sandwich and fried macaroni and cheese (I just had to try it).  The mac and cheese was good, for fried boxed mac and cheese.  The veggie burger was obviously out of a box and not homemade, but tasted decent.  The ""grilled chicken breast"" was neither grilled nor a breast.  The meat was super processed chicken meat (used loosely) pressed together in a spongy breast shape then warmed up on a flat burner.  I couldn't even finish it b/c it grossed me out.

Basically, they seem like a nice ice cream place, but the food is unfortunately not good at all.",-1

Wow, for a $20 massage $5 tip is pretty good! But they expect $15 and up! Maybe their workers are not paid well and count on making a living with a significant portion of their income being from tips. But that's not right!

trn_311,"Warning for fans of legitimate business practices:

I'd like to alert everyone about the disgusting experience I just encountered with Flight Network:

In a nutshell /TL:DR - DO NOT BOOK with them. Your valuable time is worth more. They have what is very likely an illegal bait and switch operation that YYC Deals, Kayak and other promoters may not even be aware of yet(i'm now going out of my way to spread the word):

Here's the con:

1. You find an advertised deal anywhere from $20 to $200 cheaper than competitors through a site like Kayak etc. (in my case, this 3 leg trip) and get excited.

2. You enter all of your details on their website and upon entering credit card info you are presented a screen that says:

""We apologize but we're not able to confirm the fare you've selected 'online'. Please contact one of our travel consultants at 1-866-995-2631 as they may be able to confirm your booking using another method"".

3. After trying a second credit card, you call them (if you are like me, after spending 10 minutes on the phone with your CC company thinking it's your issue).

4. You get them on the phone and after giving details of the flight, (I tried the following with two friends over two days) they try to book you into a higher price (my case over $100 more). When you ask what happened to the price online, they say it has expired or there's a problem with the system (me and my two friends got both excuses.

The bottom line: Check around the internet and do your research. Don't be a fool like I almost was! I think Yelp paints a VERY accurate picture of this business based on my experience.

It's no wonder there are plenty of people talking about this illegal / false advertising scheme on various sites. It's what you get when you Google Flight Network, FlightNetwork or FlightNetwork.com. 

Just incredible that such bait and switch can even exist in the age of Social Media. Anyway, I've never been much of an SJW, but this really wasted my time today....something I was initially really excited about now has a dark mark on it.

I intend to let everyone (regulators, and all the travel blogs I can find) know Flight Network should be avoided at all costs.",-1
trn_312,"A friend recommended going to Border Grill for brunch. She told elaborate stories of a delicious Hispanic, tapas menu that was all you can eat. She also told me about the numerous mimosa flavor options. I knew I had to go after hearing this. 

We get to the restaurant at 11am and were greeted very kindly by the hostess. We were seated on their outside patio. We tell the waiter we are doing the brunch option accompanied by the endless mimosas. This included unlimited tapas plates from a menu with about 20 options and for 15$ more, unlimited selection from their 8 different flavored mimosas. 

We order our first round of food and then get up to a section where they have food to grab at your leisure including a chia seed parfait, ceviche, and bite size churro bites. There is also a worker that will mix you a fresh salad. 

The waiter comes with our first round of food and after each bite I had to take a minute and thank The lord for bringing me to this point in my life. Every bite tasted like such an authentic blend of what the best Hispanic countries have to offer. 

Between the three of us we made it through the entire food and mimosa menu. My favorites being the albondigas (Hispanic meatballs) , steak fries, and the AMAZING chicken and waffles. My favorite mimosas were the passion fruit, pomegranate, and blood orange. 

My friend got a 15% discount for being a VIP member for being a local. So if you are a local (like me) I would inquire about that. 

After all the damage we made our bill was only 50$ per person. The service was excellent, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was relaxing. This establishment will definitely be a new brunch staple for me.",1

For the hits, the #1 are the Duritos-puffed wheat wagon wheels with chili and lime seasoning.  The first bag is free and subsequent ones are $1.  They are completely addicting and pair well with a beer.  The street corn is also a favorite of mine.  What is there not to like when you pair corn, chili lime aioil, butter, and cotija cheese?  Although the other tacos are less memorable, the Fried Cauliflower taco is one I would eat again.  The cauliflower was battered and perfectly fried with a guajillo cream suace and topped with a radish and red onion slaw.  For the misses, I would throw the rest of the tacos into the mix.  They are not terrible but just meh.  The carnitas were rather mushy while the farmers cheese taco was a congealed block of regret topped with some toppings.  Wait staff are fast and friendly.

Gourmet dinner  for 2 Adults &  2 kids $177.. yes... kids are charged regular price. We dined at Bacchanal the previous  night. So I  have  something to base my review  on. 

Since we were already there we decided to stay and eat. My 8yr old son only ate 4 slices of pizza : (

These are the items  I tried:
beef wellington - it was dry..the 
Kobe sirloin - tough and tasteless 
Ribeye- chewy 
Clams (clam bake) there were more veggies in it than clams - i think they should  just prepared it with butter and  white wine
Pork bun- blah
Chocolate  eclair was dry  
Creme  brulee- texture was a bit thick almost like pudding.  The burned sugar on top did crack when you break into it.. probably  sat out too long
Fruit - watermelon  was dried and shriveled  up. I cant believe they would  still serve it. 


Highlights !!!
Crablegs - ask the staff behind the counter to steam  them, yum!
Lamb- very good , not gamey
Broccolini & mashed  potatoes - excellent 
Bowtie  pasta with cream sauce  and  sun dried tomatoes - my favorite dish here
Pizzas - cant go wrong 
Poke & sushi - fresh 
Pesto mash- good
Desserts- tiramisu, cheesecake

I was very disappointed that there were no oysters, the charcuterie  platter pales in comparison to  Bacchanal's . The offerings were very limited and did not seem ""gourmet "" as dinner was described.    Our server was an older lady...she was very slow and forgot  to refill our  drinks several  times.

The desserts were good too - warm choc cake, salted caramel pudding and the peanut butter.  Great location to stop before a DBacks or Suns game.",1
trn_327,"The décor and food were both very good, but beer from the tap and the service was what made me give them only three stars.  We ordered Goose Island Matilda and, not only were the glasses all iced for a beer that should be served at cellar temperature, they only poured about 6 to 7 ounces of beer into the glass yet the price was as if you were getting a 12-ounce bottle, which is what the Goose Island glass is designed to hold.   

We were asked what we wanted from the bar, but nothing was mentioned about appetizers or salads.  There was no bread at all other than the piece that came with the pasta dish.  Odd for an ""American Grille.""  We don't like to fill up on bread, but it is quite normal to have a bit of decent bread served with American food.  

When we got our drinks, commenting on the tiny juice-size glass full of beer, she mentioned they had the Goose Island glasses but they were all icy and we had requested the glasses not be cold when we ordered.  As for the size, she said due to the higher alcohol content, the amount was smaller.  Having had beer at many establishments, including Goose Island, this is the first time we ever heard or saw this practice and, of course, the price did not reflect the reduced quantity.  Hoping for an improved second round if we got real sized glasses,  we requested they let the Goose Island glass be set aside to warm up for the next round but then we had to remind her that we wanted that second glass.  It held more than the first tiny juice glass but was less than 2/3 full as if they were serving us wine.

I had the fish special which was very moist and tender with nice assortment of perfectly cooked vegetables.  The hanger steak was extremely tender and the polenta was slightly sweet and very tasty.  Both the Jambalaya and the Pasta Carbonara were well seasoned and spicy.  

We would recommend the food but don't get the beer if you like Belgian-style beers or any other darker beer that should not be served ice-cold and therefore the glasses should not be iced.  If we had ordered a light, crisp lager, we would have appreciated the icy glasses.  So they may know their food, but they aren't very knowledgeable about beer.  In any case, we recommend you try to get bottled beer rather than their draft beers where they pour you a minuscule amount for a hefty price.  At least with a bottle, you're guaranteed to get the proper amount.",0
trn_328,"Saturday 06/03/2012 @ 1pm. Argh!!  This location is the worst of the worst. I have been at this location numerous times due to my work location, but today was the last. At about 1:00pm, I arrived on site and noted 3 tweakers hanging outside as usual. What was not usual was that employee Albert was standing outside smoking with them while the girl inside was stuck with a line of customers. Smoking and pandering to the customers basically adds up to loitering. The employees could care less. I walked inside and noted soda, ice, and trash all over the the floors and countertops in the fountain drink / hot dog area. I got my soda, and as I was waiting to pay, a guy ran out of the store with a case of beer. I ask the girl at the register if they want to prosecute if he's picked up. She's like no, he comes in here everyday, we already know who he is. Ok. I paid for my drink and left. What a dump unless you are a druggie or prostitute looking for a john.",-1

trn_330,"I signed up for Yelp just to write this. I often go to NYPD for dinner/lunch. I love their food, its delicious. But today, I had a really good experience. I ordered carryout because my house is not close enough for delivery. I arrived, got my food and left. Well, it was awfully busy and when I got home I noticed they forgot my salad I ordered. I called back, and, they offered to drive out to my house (which is not in their delivery range) and deliver me personally my forgotten salad. Soon enough, a woman was at my door, salad in hand along with a coupon for a free dessert. I honestly cannot express how kind this was. It makes me happy that I can go somewhere with good food AND extreamly good service.

Thank you!",1
trn_331,"busy busy busy restaurant!
It's definitely a cute spot for happy hour. Not sure if I would come here for anything other than conversation. 

Came here during happy hour and resorted to sitting outside because 1. it's extremely dark inside 2. it's extremely loud inside. The servers and manager were all really nice and made conversation with us which was both nice and at times..a bit unnecessary haha 

we ordered bruschetta (like 4 orders), sliders (delicious), hummus (delicious) annnnd a bottle of wine. dont worry, there were like 15 of us. Everything was really delicious and pretty to look at. Although i was supposed to be watching what i eat, the massive intake of carbs was definitely worth it. 

parking is available everywhere in the lovely plaza",1

From the appointment arrangement through my new glasses pick-up, everything went effortlessly. The reception staff was cordial and inviting, my exam was thorough, and Dr. Kim was an absolute breath of fresh air; thoroughly professional, informative, with an incredibly personable and comforting chair-side manner!

As for my glasses; for the first time in many, many years, my new Rx was perfect, the frames adjusted spot-on upon arrival, and the value received - priceless!

trn_338,"Okay, I tried Cafe Hollander after their soft opening, once for breakfast during the week and today for brunch. I am eager to try them for lunch and dinner. Breakfast during the week went perfectly, Sunday brunch, not so much (for me.)

The breakfast menu is eclectic and fun. If you don't feel like a lot of food, you can always order the toast with assorted toppings, such as Roasted Apple or Nuttella/Peanut Butter. I had the quiche with the salad, which was just enough food for mid-morning. The drip coffee is Collectivo and the server comes around several times to top up your coffee. Every menu item comes with a beer pairing (yes, even breakfast) and there is there tremendous Bloody Mary menu to pick and choose from. One of my fellow reviewers mentioned how the beer menu is overwhelming. I noticed that if you concentrate on the tap beers, signified by dot and the Belgium beers that are specially made for Cafe Hollander, also signified by a dot after the name, you have parred your decisions down to a manageable level. You can request a free taste sample of the tap beers to decide which one you like. Best of all, it is blessedly, blessedly quiet and you can linger with one the newspapers in the holder across from the hostess station. I'm scared that it will not be long before the dreaded Mommy brigade finds out about for breakfast.

So, the Sunday brunch. I would suggest you become acquainted with the Metro 2 bus schedule that stops at Hilldale, because if you have someone in your party who has mobility issues, they are going to have traverse a good portion of the parking lot, even in late afternoon. Even around 2 pm, they were packed and taking reservations with a 25 minute or more wait. Cafe Hollander asks for your name and phone number for the wait for a table & then texts you when a table opens up. I was lucky it was a nice day out today, so I could wait outside. The table I was lead to was in the atrium section (with the tree in the middle and the plant boxes near the ceiling). The tables are close together in that section and every kid, whether they were mobile or carried in arms, had to kick my table to get by. It didn't help that an oblivious family had planted a huge, open diaper bag right in the path of where every server had to get by. (One of the exit doors was blocked by an enormous battering ram stroller, because of course it was). I didn't feel like breakfast food at that time of day, so I ordered the burger, which didn't list lettuce or tomato on the menu and wasn't offered when I ordered the burger. Yes, I could have ordered when the server came back, but given that I wasn't given a napkin or silverware when my food came, I wasn't going to press my luck with getting tomato/lettuce. Understandably, they were busy and a lot of things were going on around me. It wasn't for me, but if you are the kind of person or party that is not put off by large, messy families or a lot of noise, this is the place for you on a Sunday.",0
trn_339,Another stop on my off-casino crawl.  I have been driving by this place every time I drive to Las Vegas and finally stopped in.  The Bass store was closed for the evening.  I should have check operating hours before but was not on any clock wondering around town.  Place is easy to get in and out.  I like the low lighting and low ceiling.  The food court did not look like much on my quick walk by.  The staff was very friendly when I signed up for a players card.,0
trn_340,"I  Los Favs! Happy to see it next to BR Coffee. One stop complex for quick breakfast burrito meet ups. Same great food, service, price and ambience. Brand new shop too! Nice and clean. Can't go wrong. I'll be back!",1

Cheap Ice cold domestic beer in a friendly neighborhood dance hall located in a dying strip mall.  I found this place strip mall crawling.  It is pretty much invisible from the road so you have to be really looking for it.

The bartender was very friendly.  Service was good.  

I came back the next day to watch a football game and had a good time.  The place is big and roomy with good service and cheap cold beer.  The bartenders and regulars are real friendly.  Seems everyone knows each other at this place.",0

trn_346,"1) Bún
I've been looking for a pho place that serves bún with this exact combination: spring roll, grille meat ball and shrimp on sugar cane. Finally found it here. 

2) Pho 
Broth was clear and light but still flavourful. Good amount of meat. 

3) Jackfruit milkshake 
Contains real jackfruit, not too blended so you could still feel the fruit. 

Restaurant was still 3/4 full on a Sunday night with a thunderstorm on the way. 
Service was fine, milkshake came at the me of our meal but maybe they were too busy or forgot. 

Would return here.",1
trn_347,"Decided to try Rustic Cafe for lunch today.  Looked at the Yelp reviews and on line menu thinking this is a place both my wife and I would enjoy.  Sometimes I'm in the breakfast mood and she's not so things looked promising.  

We were seated quickly and received average service overall.  They certainly don't go out of their way to do anything extra.  You even have to butter your own toast (actually not butter but half melted Country Crock).  I got the feeling a great deal of the food is prepackaged.  My wife ordered the salad with smoked salmon.  The lettuce was not fresh and my wife had to pick out the pieces that were super wilted and sticking to the edible leaves.  Looked a lot like that grocery store packaged salad that's been sitting in the fridge a little too long.  The smoked salmon was maybe equal to two strips of lox.  It was torn into a few pieces and rolled up so it would look bigger...which it did compared to what was essentially a side salad.  Very disappointed for $10.  

I had the Greek Skillet.  Two eggs over green peppers, ""gyro"" meat, olives, feta, and onions.  Served with side of hash browns and toast.  First, several reviews mention the cold hash browns.  Believe it..they are served barely warm.  They are flavorless as they are simply potatoes without onions or any other flavors.  The Greek Skillet was fair.  The gyro meat is the prefab strips, not nearly as good as many fast food places serve.  

No reason to return.",-1

Add in some craft beer and you have a well-balanced diet :) I love all the vegan rolls, curried fries, and cauliflower nachos. I don't get anything else because those are the only things I need in rotation to keep me happy. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the chefs sometimes seem to be inconsistent. You go in expecting what you got the time before, and it turns out to be not as impressive. Doesn't happen all the time, but I don't think that should happen at all.",1
trn_352,"I found this place from previous Yelp reviews as it was within walking distance of the strip.
It was quiet when I got there as I went later in the day so didnt gave to wait long.
Jenny did a great job of my acryllic infill and gel polish.
It was a little more expensive then what I would ordinarily pay in Australia, but given it is Vegas I expected to pay a bit more. This place is also cash only.

It's very nice, with the billboards and signs, and can be peaceful.

trn_356,"The tan looks gorgeous and Kelly was outstanding, despite me being a complete space cadet and basically doing everything I could to put my tan at risk today. First dumb thing I did was get a massage right before my spray tan. A big no-no because of the oils, which I knew deep down but assumed a quick rinse in the shower would cut it. But Kelly being her awesome thorough self wanted to consult with the owner first to make sure this wouldn't be a big waste of money. They determined I may be ok if I scrub really well in the shower, so Kelly waited for me to rinse while a friend scrubbed my back and bum, and we proceeded to give the tan its best shot. She was mega careful in her application as well as explaining how to maximize the tan, which included staying 100% away from water, aka the ""death of the spray tan"", for the next 4 hours. Easy enough, right? Don't go near any water whatsoever, got it. Until of course I decided to drink water out of a bottle with no cap on the couch and proceeded to spill it ALL OVER BOTH LEGS just an hour after she left. I panicked, texted Kelly and she walked me through how to handle it, which was to do nothing different and to see how it looked after I rinsed. She recommended Sally Hansen's airbrush legs product as a back up to fix the streaks and guess what... I didn't end up needing it! Miraculously, the streaks never showed and my tan looks like a million bucks. Do yourselves a favor and give these ladies your business. You will not be disappointed.",1

Service was fantastic! Server went the extra mile to accommodate the kiddos and my ice coffee request. 

We started our Sunday Brunch with chocolate and mochachino doughnuts. Both were good but we liked the mochachino best. Next up was the Heritages popular deviled eggs. Have to say we were a little disappointed. Tried both the original and pimento. In my opinion it was missing something. Needed a little kick. 

Main course dishes we tried the buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup. Delish! Loved the light and airy texture with a nice crispy finish. House made jams and whipped butter served on the side. The Risotto+scallops with roasted veggie dish was also tasty. Enjoyed the fresh veggies and savory mix with the pecorino cheese. Two of the four in our group enjoyed the fish and chips. North Carolina trout served with a Siracha sauce drizzled on the top. The vinegar in the coleslaw was a perfect compliment with the fish. Nice way to round out the dish and balance out the flavors.   Although we were stuffed we couldn't pass up the dessert. We opted for the Chocolate Chess Pie. Lovely presentation served with little dollops of chocolate and caramel and topped with fresh whipped cream. 

5 stars to Heritage - we walked away happy and full. Look forward to the next visit when I return to Waxhaw.",1

I am blown away by how amazing this facility is!!! I would like to recognize Dr. Roach, especially, because he has shown me that being a veterinarian isn't just about getting the job done.. that its caring about the patient and making sure the client is most comfortable leaving their best friend in his hands.. it's about making sure the patient is healthy enough to undergo any procedure and keeping the client updated on their pets status at all times. . . It's about treating the patient as if he were his own.. it's about  making sure the patient is most comfortable with his surroundings and making sure he's well taken care of by the staff.. Doc does it all!!!! N I do Happen to know first hand because I was an employee at this facility for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, I had to leave due to personal reasons. But during my year and a half as a kennel attendant,   I actually felt like a star having had the opportunity to work here!! I have also brought 2 of my own cats here as well!  I will never take my pets anywhere else!  If you want the comfort of knowing that ur furry friend is going to be in good hands, come to West Russell!

trn_369,"Took the lady here for a birthday celebration, and this was our first time ever going to a wine bar. Wow. Corkbuzz definitely exceeded our expectations as far as service, professionalism, knowledge, and quality of food and drink. And this was their soft opening!!

When you walk in, you can definitely see that this place came straight from New York. The ambiance is very cool, very modern, chique. I'll admit, when we both opened the menu, neither of us recognized many styles of the bottles, but they didn't treat it pretentiously. We told our waitress about the styles that we normally like, and she recommended a fantastic french wine called... *checks phone*...eh, doesn't matter, it was a Cotes du Rhone. And it was fantastic. 

What I really like is Corkbuzz's policy on tasting. They pour a little bit table-side and let you taste anything before you commit to it, even glasses. What a cool policy.

We ordered food as well; I got the burger and it was out of this world. A couple other people at our table ordered some oysters which were great as well. 

Overall, it was a great experience. Corkbuzz's great food and great service complement each other like cheese and... I'll let your mind be responsible for the cheesiness.",1
trn_370,Expected a lot more. The bone -in food filet  was ok but the sides were better.  Kraft and DelMonicos is wayyy better for your $.

It tricks you with fun, while you're doing something that's actually good for you, sorta like buckwheat pancakes! Can't say enough about Tonya. Maybe it's Tanya. Don't want to misspell that hot chick's name cos she could tear you in two with her left toe. While watching her craftily execute moves I never imagined myself doing, I was mesmerized.

trn_372,"Every time I come to this location it's like 5:30am before I go to my office, so the store is NOT busy.  The service here takes FOREVER.  There is one guy who is actually really good w/ customer service, seems maybe late 20's and is very friendly and has ""get up and go"" but the rest of them will literally watch you stand around for 5 min before taking your order.  ""We'll be right with you"" ....but not really.  Since I like a lot of cream in my coffee the one dude will charge me for a grande coffee in a venti cup, but the others haven't caught onto this concept.... instead they charge you for a huge coffee when you're only getting a grande.  

Today I was the ONLY customer besides someone at drive-thru and they didn't have my online order at all, and when I asked how long espresso would take one of the girls said ""about 5 min.""  Really?  5 min on espresso when I'm the only customer?  So obviously didn't have time to wait ....hence using the ""convenient"" mobile app to order.  Ended up having to get a regular coffee.

Their cups ALWAYS leak on the sides so I had molten hot coffee dripping on my hand.  There was about 4 or 5 people working in there yet I had to stand around and wait on one of them to take my order.

This Starbucks is the worst.  I only go here b/c it's convenient.  Of course, this is a first-world problem but it makes for a crappy morning when you expect a mobile order to be ready and it's not.  I hate paying full price for sub-par quality and service.  Starbucks can do better.",-1
trn_373,"My wife and I are moving to Charlotte soon and we stayed here during a short visit.

The breakfast was great.  The coffee was amazing.  Man was it good!  It's open from 6:00-10:00am and is included.  Huge plus in my book. 

The staff was super professional and competent.  

The room was very clean and very comfortable.  

The bed was perfect.  The black-out drapes made for a perfect sleeping environment.  Air conditioner was robustly capable.  

The bathroom was great with one huge exception and it was a big one for us.  The door to the bathroom was pocket/slide with no lock.  There was no interior privacy enclosure/door for the toilet.  Gross!  

We paid $107 per night. 

I highly recommend this hotel.",1

We had all been here before so we weren't playing around when it came time to order. 2 pitchers of the kick ass margarita and majority got the enchilada dinners. Chips and salsa to start off obviously. Food came out pretty quick for a busy and packed Saturday night at 6pm. Someone in he restaurant had a birthday so the staff came out banging pots and pans and the lights went out so they could light up the birthday dessert. It was neat and original. Probably one of the best New Mexican restaurants in AZ.,1
trn_381,"I am not sure I have ever had mole before or if maybe I have had it and not liked it so stayed away.  Whatever, I did like the mole on my chicken enchiladas.  The enchiladas themselves were soso.  Quite often in Mexican restaurants I have to mix the rice and beans together to get them down for several reasons.  This time the rice and beans each stood on their own merits.  The chips were good and served warm.  I preferred the red salsa, even though it was hotter, as it had more flavor to me.  It is sort of runny and is a bit hard to chase around the little plate that comes for that purpose.  The enchiladas came with all white meat, my favorite, but I could have done without the chunk of cartilage and two bone pieces I found.

Many of the customers there during lunch on a Friday seemed like regulars.  I don't think I heard a single word of Spanish from either customers or employees the whole time I was in there.  The dining room with it's flagstone floors has a nice comfy feel to it.  There were two waitresses that seemed like they were working as a team and I didn't wait long or want for anything.  The parking lot holds small cars easier than trucks but there were several work trucks in there.

The first time I called towards the end of day, the man on the line was telling me that they could not hear me and that they had issues with their line and kept hanging up and did not bother taking my phone number to try to call me back even after several attempts on my end. Then after a few days, I called again and was appalled by how rude the man on the phone was . I decided not to use them. I never take the time to put any reviews usually.

trn_385,"I recently had a weekend trip to Cleveland, and was looking forward to check out one of the newest aquariums in the country. Working in a zoo, I probably tend to be more critical than most of the visitor experience at such a facility, but I really believe this place is not ready to be open to the public. Between near-empty tanks and extremely poor signage and exhibit design, the aquarium is simply not ready.

Being from out of town it was really difficult to find this place as there are no street signs directing visitors to the parking lot for the aquarium. Moreover, most zoos have more extensive aquaria than Cleveland's and charge much less. They do not even have discounts or reciprocity for zoo or aquarium members of other institutions. 

I understand that it's a labor of love (and LOTS of time) to build a collection and grow coral, but the institution is only hurting it's reputation with what it displays currently. I would not recommend this as a tourist destination. I would also strongly encourage the aquarium management to invest in some street signs and a larger sign for the building in which it is housed.",-1

trn_388,"Featured on BuzzFeed's list, ""The Best Pizza Spot In Every State, According To Yelp"" --- Casanova Brothers Pizza!

Practically skipping into this clean and great establishment, I was greeted by one of the brothers, Tony.  Charisma and charm exuded from the guy as he introduced himself with a firm handshake. I like this guy! After our order was placed, we took our number to a booth and sat down for a delicious pizza meal. 

First to come out were some garlic knots on the house from Tony for being first time customers. Fluffy little knots of dough with a kiss of garlic were set before us. Dip it in the supplied marinara and enjoy! Next out was our order of piping hot fried zucchini. These babies were amazing! A little while later, a beautiful 16"" Deluxe pie was brought to the table. The crust was thin, crispy, and charred nicely. And it wasn't greasy! But did it pass the fold test? It did. The toppings stayed in place and the first bite had a good amount of cheese drag. While our pie held ample toppings, the prevailing taste was the sauce. Mmm! As for eating it cold from the fridge, it was just as satisfying. 

All in all, it was a great experience. Tony would come by every now and then to check on things, addressing us by our names, and gushed with pride about how fresh and great their product is. We even heard him talking about making the Buzzfeed list! Here's hoping they thrive in their new and bigger location once they open! Much success, Casanova Brothers!

trn_391,"Absolute Must See!

I remember watching Mac King on Worlds Great Magic in 90s so when I was in Vegas I made a plan to go see his afternoon show. Boy was I surprised. I had no idea his show would be as great as it was. The man is hilarious. If you have any sense of humor, I don't see how he cannot make you laugh. 

I took my girlfriend to go see his 1pm show and she was a little hesitant from being hung over from the night before. I think she figured it was going to be a long hour but by the time MK came out, she was laughing hard. She forgot all about the hangover. 

Mac is a total goofball but that's what makes him funny (we're laughing with him, not at him). I also like that he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's there to entertain and he does not disappoint. He does a lot of simple magic tricks but he does them so well. There's a lot of audience participation as well, so don't be shy if he calls on you to come up and help him out with something. 

His show was fantastic. You can still find girls handing out free tickets with drink purchase ($10) coupons in front Harrahs or even at the Flamingo. I highly recommend finding them. It's an afternoon show at about a little over an hour in length so you will still have your nights free to party. 

I will definitely see him again when I'm back in Vegas.",1

The restaurant is located for in the shopping center next to the gas station and Pizza Hut. The good news is that there's plenty of parking and booths inside if you're dining in. And even better news is that they take online orders! So if your looking for hassle free easy ordering this is your place! 

The menu is pretty standard but I haven't had a dish I didn't like everything from the egg drop soup to the garlic chicken and shrimp and broccoli are always hot and full of flavor! And they don't skimp on the portions either! Whether it's lunch or dinner you'll have enough for at least two meals! 

Overall, super glad they are in my hood and I look forward to returning again and again.",1

The actual donating was conducted in a professional matter by friendly staff. I feel great!

I won't name the other plasma center that I've repeatedly tried to donate at, but this one is FAR better by comparison! The other place made me wait 5 hours only to tell me that they couldn't see me that day. Today they only made me wait one hour, but I wish they had been more upfront with me. They all acted like they were fast food workers. Both times, one of the ladies complained about how hungry she was the entire time I was there. Ugh.

trn_407,"One of the Best Thai Restaurants in town.

Let me start off by saying I have been to all of the Archies locations and this is by far the best and most consistent. The interior is beautiful and the wait staff is very friendly. But if your like me and order take-out then prepare to suffer through ordering because one of the kitchen staff normally answers the phone and lets just say Ixnay on the English. But for the quality and price of the food you cannot beat it. 

I normally order the Chicken Satay and to be honest there have been times when this has been overcooked. But only when I phone in an order. And I can honestly say it's only been twice in 30 some odd visits. The peanut sauce is my favorite out of all the Thai places I've tried. Also on the appetizer front is Beef Jerky which comes with a light citrus sauce. I dont care for Thai Jerky on a norm but theirs is good. 

For the entrée my norm is Pad Ka Pow (Spicy Basil) Beef. It is ground beef in a spicy chili basil sauce with sliced bell pepper and zucchini. Seriously, it is without a doubt my favorite dish of theirs. The meat is so spicy and flavorful. It always clears the sinuses. If I'm not feeling Ka Pow on a certain night than I get Pad Thai. Their Pad Thai has a fresh taste to it. And while I enjoy shrimp Pad Thai; theirs while being good had the tails intact which is a pain in the keester. So I would suggest getting the chicken version of the dish.  I have had other various entrées that are equal in quality and flavor. And love trying new dishes when ever I need a change. 

And finally dessert. They feature a plate of sticky rice with fresh fruit which is amazing. It's a bit pricey ringing in at $7 but I think it is worth it for the amount of yummy goodness you get. And it is easily big enough for two people. 

So take a chance and try this place. As I have said it's the best Archies in town. 

Happy Eating,
Jace",1

The stations were consistently full and the staff was working hard to ensure they were kept stocked. The highlights for me were the mash potatoes, crab legs, and the lemon sorbet.

I tried the wings and a couple of ribs. I was taken back when he said there were no sauce choices for wings, but that they were smoked and he assured me that they are great with the flavor that comes with it, slight hot and slight sweet. He was right, they tasted great. The ribs were good but overcooked as they were too tender. Atmosphere was comfortable and our service was friendly and fast Will return.",1
trn_415,first thing I noticed was two employees eating a waffle off the same plate. They weren't on break just eating while working. The kitchen floor was filthy with food all over the floor near the grill. The employees just walked through it. Must of been 8 to 10 employees working but no one can sweep up the floor? The waffle makers and area they sit in were covered in globs of waffle batter...not sure if that's normal but it looked pretty gross. I'd pretty much lost my appetite while I stared at the kitchen from my seat..food was average but I didn't eat much..that was my first and last visit to waffle house. .not for me,-1

There are plenty of good breakfast items on the buffet. Some stand outs for me were the egg (omelette) station, crispy bacon, breakfast breads, Portuguese sausage and coffee service.  There's more,of course, but what else do you need for $8pp.

We went yesterday and they appear to either have a new chef since we were here last summer or whoever does lunch does things a big differently.

The corn and lentil beignets looked mostly like battled fritters of whole corn kernels which is not how I remember them.

I ordered two entrees because I was worried by favorite dish might disappoint and I wanted to try something new and not reget it. So, to hedge my bets, I got both my favorite Jamaican Green Curry and a new item, Seasonal Vegetable Paella. Both were good, but the JGC is better. I wasn't wowed like I was the first time, but it was still very good.",1
trn_422,This is a very good restaurant with creative food. Went on Friday before Valentines Day and the restaurant was comfortably busy. I had 3 of the appetizer dishes for dinner along with a Caesar salad and each course was very good. Flavors are well combined but still mild flavors but you can tell a lot of thought and experience went into each dish. Service is very good with cutlery exchanged with each course. BYOB is a big plus. The food is made for wine! The room is intimate and has a very comfortable feel with dim lights and candles.,1

trn_424,"Tonight was my Birthday (7/17/2017) and so we went to Flemings to celebrate. Appetizer of Shrimp cocktail came out and it looked and tasted very good. Order was taken for dinner and my wife ordered a side salad as her meal because she wasn't super hungry and decided to add salmon to it to flare it up. I ordered the king crab leg entree but wanted soup to come out first, which it did a short while later along with my wife's salad that was supposed to be an entree. Now the salad, although premature, didn't come out as requested with Salmon on it (as my wife may have considered eating it since it was at the table already) so it was sent back. Soup was very good and flavorful and the servers and assistant were on point as far as pre-bussing and getting refills. Ok, now entrees hit the table. First impression was Blah.... presentation was severely lacking. My wife's salad is really just lettuce with a small filet of salmon on top. Not really much body to the salad and she said the salmon was very bland as she couldn't have butter... but you would have thought the chef could have gotten creative with it despite the allergy to butter/oil. Now my Crab legs, when it was placed in front of me it was 3 small pieces about 6in in length that were halved. That's it, very boring and portion size for amount paid was horrible. I inquired with food runner about the portion size confirming this was my entree and he said yes. My wife and I looked at each other in amazement. Approximately 5 min later or so into the meal one of our two servers came by and said ""your other half of your meal will be out shortly"". Well that's a relief, but when it came out it tasted like salt water from the ocean and was not edible. 50% of the cost was comp'd. The server also spilled Ice Tea on/in my wife's purse. When we get the bill, my wife was charged $44 for the salmon and I think $12 for the lettuce. A $56 salmon salad that was horrible at best. The salad was more expensive than my crab legs. So Sad, time to find a new place.",-1

trn_427,"I really like that this place, named after a city in Turkey, has a menu with some surprises that we never see at other shawarma places in Calgary- and I mention shawarma because its full name is ""Adana Shawarma and Grill."" I made my first visit there today and at the suggestion of some Turkish fellows I'd seen there before (on a visit when I just stepped in to check out the menu) called ""Iskendar Kabob,"" and I loved it. It comes with beef or chicken- lamb is trad per wikipedia but this was what was on offer- and I had beef.  They put a few bite-size pieces of a fairly thick pita (think a Greek pita, not Lebanese, not Turkish pide either), poured some mild tomato sauce and a little melted butter on there, then added a pile of beef from the spit. They serve it with very good long grain rice on one side of the plate at Adana, and the other has magnificent thick yogurt, like labneh (discovered last visit it's a mixture of Greek yogurt and sour cream- it WORKS!). It was very good, very rich and filling if a bit pricey by shawarma shop standards at $12.99, but it's delicious and very nicely plated, real porcelain and metal utensils. I got a free treat from their pastry counter too- not tired baklawa but a chewy confection I'd not had before.",1
trn_428,"Totally delicious food with friendly service. Have been wanting to try this place for a while now.

Had no issues making a reservation for 7 peeps a couple of days before, the gentleman was super lovely and friendly who took my call. They also had no qualms about separating the bills.

Enjoyed a few cocktails with dinner, including an apple cider mimosa (so so good!), one of their drink features. We were entertaining family from the States so of course we had to order a couple of poutines as starters to share, which were very good.

I opted for the mac and cheese as my main and did not regret it. The noodles were perfectly cooked, drowning in creamy cheesy goodness and topped with crispy butter Ritz crackers. I'm drooling thinking about it tbh. Most of our table got either the chicken and waffles or half chicken, everyone was totally stuffed but loved their food.

okay, back to realism.  there are quiet bit of selection of food to choose from, and they could look deceivingly good.  but the taste is where my rage-review comes from.  imagine the most horrifying cafeteria food, or your nearby worst buffet food, combine them and you have mgm grand buffet.

Presentation of the food was excellent as well the way the nachos are delivered!  The waitress continued checking on us thru out our dinning experience. While she cover other tables too.

trn_432,"I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.

We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.

The carpet has a very random pattern with fibers running multiple directions and height and is a single color - making it extremely difficult to find a perfect match to drop in where the damage was cut out.  Daniel, the tech who arrived on time, spent a considerable amount of time figuring out how to match it.  He worked his magic and I can literally not tell where the repair was made.  I am ecstatic!  My wife didn't think it was worth it because it was under the edge of the carpet, but now - it's gone and back to looking like a single piece of carpet.

I stood there waiting to get sat for over 15 mins, once seated I was greeted by my waitress whom was rude & barely knew English. I proceeded to the buffet the food LOOK amazing but looks fooled me. Once I sat down I realized that the food was cold & hard. I sat in my seat picking at my food around my plate. The assistant manager must've noticed and walked over asking me what was wrong I didn't want to make a big deal about it because I didn't want to draw any attention but he walked away and minutes came back with a lady whom I will assume was the manager. She walked over with an attitude and accused me of not wanting to pay as though I didn't have $ or something. I felt so degraded I didn't want to argue so I paid even after I paid she had an attitude and told me that she'd take $1.00 off of food that I didn't even intake as though she was doing me a favor. While taking my payment her and the assistant manager spoke in their native language arguing back and forth. I believe the assistant manager was arguing on my behalf. Nevertheless I would never ever go back to that establishment ever again even if someone tried to drag me in there!!!",-1

Happy Hour stuff including the free appetizer set up by the bar is a good deal and nice touch! Daily specials are great and atmosphere is a little funky and we actually feel like we're in an urban setting. Bartenders and staff are kinda laid back, it's nice to be in a place where you don't have to be a 21 year old model to work or hang out :)",1

Also you can earn points on purchases that can add up to money off in the store.",1
trn_446,"Went there on Sept 3,2016.
Ordered the twin ginger and onion lobsters. It tasted fishy and it was not fresh. 
The Peking duck was the worst. It had a very nice pictured on the wall of a Peking dick at $36.99 + taxes. Do not expect a full duck. They give us a half a duck but charges for a full duck.
Nothing compares to the Chinese restaurants in Toronto. In Toronto the restaurants would show you the live lobsters and they sliced the Peking duck right in front of you. Over here, everything is done behind the closed kitchen. I would not be surprised they keep the goods parts for them shelves to eat.

Also, the white rice was very mushy. 

I would give them no stars because they should not be in business.",-1
trn_447,Not sure how they stay in business and do a huge business. Food is either salted for a survival journey or flavorless. The sauces are hit and miss and they seem to lean towards better servixe to nonenglish speakers. Been there 4 times in 12 years never good. I forget and go back.,-1
trn_448,"Came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night. There was not much wait to be seated and select beers and wines were free that night. Sweet! 

Unfortunately I am dairy intolerant and a LOT of the buffet has dairy in it. Even items that could be dairy free, like spaghetti, were rendered inedible because the kitchen sprinkled cheese on top. 

Also the salad bar selection was pretty small, not a whole lot of vegetables or dressings to choose from. I REALLY missed balsamic vinaigrette... that wasn't an option. 

I still managed to eat a decent meal (thank goodness for the Asian foods section) and my boyfriend enjoyed the buffet since he has no dairy issues. I probably wouldn't come back though. For the price, I just didn't feel like I got a whole lot of value or variety due to my dairy issues, which is why you come to a buffet.",0
trn_449,"Came back to make a purchase and of course, clean store and professional staff. Was never pressured. Was fondling 4 weapons on the counter before making my purchase and there was no aggregation or anything from the worker. In fact he was giving me his personal opinion, asking what I was looking for etc.  He showed me a FNS 9 which I ended up buying for less than some of the others I was looking at. Point being I wasn't up sold and he was more interested in how the weapon felt to me than the price tag. On top of that, military discount AND ON TOP OF THAT it was 100 less than msrp and gun broker. This is the local gun store we have all been waiting for  

As for the reviewer who said they have no aks?  It's a bs review because they're fully stocked on aks.. even ak pistols if that's your thing and bulk 7.62 39mm ammo. They have been stocked since I have been coming here in April. 

I cannot say enough good things about this place, I have spent several thousand here on optics and weapons and don't regret any of it. I will continue to frequent this store as it is the epitome of local, fair and friendly. Bravo spartan arms. 

BTW they now offer ccw classes at the ccsp for 80 bucks. Have to sign up in the store and even though it costs, you can bring your own ammo and don't have to sit through that bs like at the LV gun store. I'll be doing my renewal here when the time comes.",1
trn_450,"Ate here two years ago and we simply had to go back there for breakfast again. Unfortunately it didn't stand up to our foodie memory. 

Coffee was weak and the waffle was nasty. Seems like they over sprayed or over oiled the waffle iron and it soaked into the waffle. White sausage gravy wasn't good at all. Perhaps we should have stuck with Greek inspired good. 

The table top was dirty and sticky. Wonder if it was ever wiped down or washed. Yuck!!  

Not sure we'll return.",0
trn_451,"Been here many times, and consider it one of the best local places for an authentic Philly cheesesteak.  The Original is always a good bet with delicious combination of melt in your mouth meat, grilled onion and white american cheese, not to mention the bread with just the right amount of chewiness and softness to soak up the juices and not fall apart.  

Will keep going back, again and again.  Good job guys!!",1

This place has very nice locker rooms and some large multipurpose areas. I haven't taken any fitness classes here yet but I have heard great things about them. I really like the basketball court and the rock climbing wall, both are a blast! I would definitely recommend this gym as the best in the Surprise area.",1
trn_454,"So this place is pretty, I liked the atmosphere. The staff were all very friendly. It was pretty clean. They have a pretty good selection of different smoothies, teas, and Diamond Pops. They are so neat looking which is what enticed me. I ordered the fresh strawberry dipped in dark chocolate, almonds, and waffle cone pieces. It was was a nice treat. I'd come back if I was in the area.",1

trn_456,"Good Place For Wings & Ribs

I'm not a pizza fan.  But I discovered that Augie's has some of the best wings and ribs the way I like them.  The wings are bone-in, cooked extra crispy, plain, with sauce on the side.  Not many places offer the crispy wings and plain with sauce on the side.  Their ribs have the right amount of sauce and are cooked well.  They are 'fall off the bone' tender and every order I've had were excellent cuts.  I would certainly recommend Augie's for wings and ribs.  I don't know about their pizza.  I've never had it.",1
trn_457,Cheap tools! I love this place since they carry things that most places don't.  I came here for some ramps to drive my quad onto my truck.  They had 4-5 sets to choose from.  The only complaint I would say is they get busy and they cant always get to everyone right away but it's probably because they pass the savings onto the customer by not having tons of employees.  The tools aren't craftsman so don't expect a lifetime warranty but I don't always need that kind of tool.  I hardly use tools!,1
trn_458,"I am obsessed with eggs. I can have it anytime of day. And I especially love ANY hot sauce with my eggs. Unfortunately, this place doesn't even have it as an option. Like, nothing. 

A little too confident/cocky with their recipes if they don't want to accommodate customers' personal preferences. Kinda rude. 

Not impressed. Sorry.",-1

trn_460,I'm still very disappointed with the cake I ordered for my sons 1st Birthday. It was not only expensive but the excuse was unacceptable. Why must a customer provide a picture of the cake if the decorator decides to make up their own design? Will not return. In my opinion this bakery is over priced and the decorator needs to pay close attention. I called the store and the excuse was ridiculous. I took it back and they changed the ugly block letters you'll see below and they also broke the trunk. They did take $25 off for the elephant. They should have just refunded half of my money for half of the effort. I wish I received the cake I originally ordered. From the beautiful pics on Instagram to the very ugly cake I received. Highly disappointed.,-1

trn_462,"We've been going to this place for a couple years now. We ran into an incident where they forgot to clip my dogs nails, but they quickly fixed it by having my dog get brought in to get his nails clipped and we got a complimentary bath. We gave them another chance, but it was a mistake. We took him to get a bath last week and noticed his ears weren't clean once we came home. I told one of the employees, Samantha, about it, but she said it's just how their ear cleaner works, they use an oil where it dissolved any wax in the ear canal and when they shake their head, it brings it up. She then said ""meaning anything your seeing means the ear solution is doing its job."" A week later and my dogs ears are red and infected. He lives in the house, so he couldn't have gotten it from being outside. That will be the last time we go to this place.",-1

They didn't open the trunk on my suv to clean at all like typically.

We really do enjoy Rosatti's, their thin crust is crispy and full of flavor.  Their Calzones are REALLY good and again none of that ""other"" cheese to overwhelm you.  Good quality products are certainly in place and we keep coming back for more!

**This is a take out / delivery only location so keep that in mind**",1
trn_471,"I'm not sure how long this place has been open but it's new to me so I was pretty excited to try it.  I tend to like a light soup for lunch and it seems that I'm always in search of a great place.  
We came here just before noon on a Friday and the place was pretty full, but we had no trouble getting a seat.  Sat down and noticed the water was already waiting on the tables for us.  In fact, the water was waiting on every table.  I'm not sure how much I like that idea.  Not only was it room temperature, it kind of makes you think about people walking by your table before you get there and sneezing.  That being said, I drank mine during the meal and reached over to the next empty table and stole theirs.  I would have preferred if someone would have refilled mine but they seemed pretty busy and not quite used to the crowds.
We ordered the Coconut Prawns as an appetizer and it came pretty quick.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know if I enjoyed it $3.00 per prawn.  
I had the Satay Chicken Pho, well that's what I ordered anyway.  What showed up was beef.  I hope.  The meat was raw. (I know, I know, which is how they serve beef Pho)  I just don't think I've ever had chicken served that way.  I ate it, thinking it looked like beef, hoping that it was.  It was ok for flavor.  Nothing I will rush back for, but good enough to try again.
My wife had a beef vermicelli bowl and she said that once the flavors all mixed together it was pretty good.
This place was ok.  It did not knock my socks off but I'm sure in the Ultra-competitive downtown market they will either improve or be replaced.",0
trn_472,"Wow Drais!  

I have to say I like the new look and image that they have now.  They are a pretty good contender in the Las Vegas nightclub game.  The even newly remodeled Cromwell which used to be Bill Gambling saloon is looking really good.

Cousin (as we were walking through The Cromwell to Drais): doesn't it look way nicer in here after the remodel?
Me: yeah, it's not as ghetto looking.

Let's face it, old Drais was ghetto and attracted a less than fantastic crowd, since it was an after hours club old Drais attracted the ones who used an extra substance to stay awake into the wee hours of the night leading to the morning.  The casino old Drais was located in was, for lack of a better word, ghetto.  

So enough of the old Drais, new Drais is where it is at!  I was with a group of 4 guys and 4 girls, and we got comped admission through guestlist, the entrance was kind of hard to spot since it is towards the side of the casino.  Once you get trough, you have to go inside some elevators and go up to the top floor.  There you exit out, walk down a set of stairs and voila, you are at Drais.  

First thought, oh...it looks like Xs.  Second thought, wow...this is so much nicer than the old Drais.

So Drais when you first enter, they have this little balcony portion that overlooks the entire club plus the outside portion.  Camera whores, that is a great photo op right there.  There is an inside and an outside part and the tables are situated around the dance floor on an incline.  The DJ booth is at the front of the dance floor facing the outside portion so if you are standing at the balcony at the front you would see the back of the DJ.  Drais has a huge disco ball chandelier in the middle of the dance floor that goes up and down.  Drais also has some huge screens behind the DJ booth similar to Light and Exchange LA.  I have to say, Drais has some amazing light shows and led screens!  The outside pool area is so pretty, my boyfriend mentioned that it looked like Surrender.  I personally think it looks way better than Surrender, way more eye pleasing, plus you get a way better view at Drais than Surrender.  They close off the pool area in the beginning of the night and open it up later as the club gets more crowded.

Bathrooms are on the side, you have to walk down a set of stairs.  Bathrooms are nice and spacious.  They're very well lit for a club bathroom.  There are a few stalls so you probably will not have to wait too long for a stall even if the club is packed.  The downside is that they have a long row of mirrors right when you enter into the bathroom, so girls get caught up in that area fixing their hair and makeup.  It is a huge pain when a bunch of girls block off the walk way trying to take a pic of themselves in front of the mirrors.  

The crowd is odd.  That's kind of why I docked off a star, the crowd is a really wide mix of people.  I saw quite a few groups of older ladies, I'm talking like my mothers age ladies and then there were the typical single guys that line the side of the dance floor with a drink in hand staring at the groups of girls dancing.  A really wide array of people that I cannot quite put my finger on.  

What really helped save the night though was the DJ switch up they pulled on us.  We wed expecting Sidney Samson, you know the Riverside song.  Instead we get 3lau, way better trade off.  3lau killed it, we had so much fun!!  

It did not get too packed which is what we loved.  After a disastrous night at Marquee where I'm pretty sure they exceeded the club capacity, seriously, I felt like a sardine.  There were so many people.  Drais had a good amount of people, not dead and not super packed, both of which can really kill a night.

I had a lot of fun at Drais, it is a way better club than the old Drais.  I love the remodel!!  I really recommend checking it out, the venue is gorgeous!",1
trn_473,Great friendly staff! Everyone is so kind. I have been here 3 times with my girlfriend and we both agree that they give GREAT pedicures! We definitely will be back,1
trn_474,Toast Cafe is my long time favorite. I wish the tables were a bit bigger simply because I am very tall. It's cozy and every meal reminds me of home! Sad that they no longer serve dinner! Highly recommend the Left Coast BLT,1

trn_476,"As you all know, Vegas has tons of steak houses so it is tough to say one is greater than another.....this place rocks!

1.  Ambiance - typical M style open environment with tall ceilings. Not intimate yet nice feeling regardless

2.  Parking - you are in a casino resort so be prepared forth normal walk and navigation through a smokey casino. 

3. Service -  I would say near or at the top of the class. From the reception to the server to the table bus position, I found all to just right. 

4.  Food -  wow!  Had the bone in filet mignon. First time to try a bone in filet. This was a very thick cut and I had it media, rare. It was just right throughout the entire cut. I wonder how they do it without butterflying the filet???  For the table, we also had the ribeye and this was not their prime cut bone in, yet it was tasty. Also had the Ahi tuna, asparagus,scalloped potatoes and wild mushrooms. Everything was perfect!

5.  Wine list - great selection of California wines, italians and even some French, Australians and Chilean!  Some were very expensive yet even the reasonably priced   Malbec was nice

Some of the best steaks I tried with the right atmosphere so I say, check this place for sure",1
trn_477,"I made up my mind about this store before I had the chance to taste the food.  The music was too loud to think, the staff looked as if they were high. And the order of things blew my mind, how the tossed my food up on the counter. I asked for a bag to my surprise I had to do it my self, no problem with putting my items in a bag but only if I'm at a self check out register but not a a restaurant ( didn't know it was self serve in a way). Any who so at this point I was annoyed and had to pay for things individually made it worse. By the time I finished ordering a simple turkey sandwich with cheese, chips and a pickle my order was 9 bucks. So I left mad saying I wish I would have went to subway. Well that all  changed once I got home and ate my food.  WOW was all I could say, I was really impressed with how good it was even though it was just meat, cheese, lettuce and mayo. It was pretty impressive and it's hard to impress me. So besides the goofy staff, the self serve way of life I will be going to Jimmy Johns from now on. Besides when its hot out I really like cold foods.",1

I love the overall theme of Olive and Ivy. The mixture of old and new school class is really nice. Servers are always attentive and are great at time management and handling all of their tables professionally and Efficiently. I had Pita and Hummus as an appetizer and it's definitely my new fave. The prosciutto mascarpone tortellini is to die for. I sipped on White Wine Sangria while I thought was way better than some other restaurants I had drank it at recently. This is the perfect place whether you're looking for a light lunch or a classy date night on the canal. 10/10 would recommend. Will be back many, many more times!",1

trn_483,"Came to Yorkdale around 4:00pm and waited in line for 30 mins to get the buzzer. Once you have that you can carry it and walk around. At first, they told us the wait time will be around 2-3 hrs, but around 2.5 hrs later, they call us and told us it will delay. At last, we waited until 9:30pm to get a table for 5.
We ordered tomato basil pasta, pasta carbonara, lemon garlic shrimp (forgot to take a pic) and herb crusted filet of salmon. I personally like the tomato basil pasta the best and for the salmon, it ain't too dry or tough but melts across your tongue.
Dessert time!! At first, we wanted to order coffee and cream chocolate supreme and tiramisu cheesecake but unfortunately were all sold out. So we changed to fresh strawberry, godiva chocolate and white chocolate raspberry truffle. They are smooth, creamy and also really huge (probably need to share or it will be too heavy).
Overall, the food is great but is it worth to wait for 5-6 hrs? Probably depend on.. are you going to buy stuff in the mall cuz actually every store also have lineups, so time actually passes super fast when you are shopping with your friends.",1
trn_484,"Echo Sushi is currently my top choice for All You Can Eat Sushi! The quality here is really very good, particularly considering that it's AYCE!

The place is always busy which you want from an AYCE place because it means that their ingredients are fresh due to high throughput. The service is pretty decent and the food comes fairly quickly. They have a couple of their own unique sushi rolls which are great, such as the riceless sushi roll and their deep fried football roll. I also consider their beef ribs to be the best I've ever had at an AYCE place relatively speaking.

Due to their popularity, their prices have been increased in the 2015/2016 time frame but if you really want AYCE Sushi and you want quality, this is the place to go!",1
trn_485,"This was the worst hotel ever!!! We had booked the hotel for a two night stay last weekend. On our second night, a large group of kids were staying on our floor.  They had parties in the hallway, played beerpong outside of our door, had loud music, got into fights, knocked on our door, called our number numerous times, cat called us when we walked by to leave, and when we called down to the reception 5 times to complain, they never did anything to quiet them down. It's quite funny that they make you initial a contract when checking in saying that after 1 warning on being loud, you can get evicted. Ha! These kids partied until 5am.  When we checked out, we complained to the reception and she was so unprofessional. I guess a couple of the kids were checking out at the same time as us and she looked over at them and said ""where you guys bad boys last night"" (in french) like it was some joke. Then she continued to make excuses for them. Not once did she apologize on behalf of the poor management of the hotel or take accountability that this was their fault as a hotel for not inforcing a rule they clearly have every guest sign when they check in.  Do not waste your money on this dump.",-1
trn_486,"HOORAY FOR MY 200TH REVIEW!!

Came here for the ELECTRIC DAISY CARNIVAL LAS VEGAS EDITION...

THIS PLACE IS FUCKING HUGE!!! I heard its about 7 LA COLOSSEUMS PUT TOGETHER?? 

In my opinion, this venue was MUCH MUCH better than the LA COLOSSEUM...why do I say this?

the speedway is just one huge circle! there is no need for crazy obstacle courses *cough LA COLOSSEUM...its not hard to get lost in LA cuz of all the different area....but being at the SPEEDWAY...its not hard to find your friends at all

this place was so spacious that they were able to accommodate all the cars and parking as well too. another cool thing about this place was that as people walked down from the entrance onto the grounds...the pathways walking down to the grounds were pretty spacious *cough LA COLOSSEUM narrow little pathways.

I believe the SPEEDWAY has a 5 year contract with INSONIAC for future EDC events. I do feel bad for LA though...Im pretty sure the council is crying in their arms that they lost this magical event. 
INSTEAD
insomniac will be making LAS VEGAS that much more $$$$.

isnt it crazy how one person...can create a holiday...and make that holiday THE BIGGEST HOLIDAY IN VEGAS?? before it was memorial day weekend....now its EDC WEEKEND!

I can truly say that EDC IS MUCH GREATER THAN UMF or COACHELLA

I had such a great time this last weekend, and Im happy that I actually went! 

SEE YOU ALL NEXT YEAR!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",1
trn_487,"Let me just say, I love the taste of a Chipotle Burrito when everything is done right.

When the rice is cooked all the way through and has enough cilantro, it's awesome. When the black beans are cooked all the way through, it is awesome.  But it is impossible to pick off or pick out a bad element.  

This location is a hit or miss, usually a miss.  Sometimes the beans are crunchy, sometimes the rice is crunchy or under seasoned.  And if one element is bad, the whole burrito sucks and is a waste of money.  

Sick of wasting money here, just need to find a better location.",-1

Will never come here again as it was not the first bad experience we have had at this location. Would recommend avoiding this office and choosing another location.,-1

I'm over the search for those basic shower curtains with no personality so I decided that I was going to make my own shower curtain but I needed it to have some razzle dazzle!

I stopped in Hancock about a week ago and the fabric I was interested in  was on a 30% off sale..  I walked around the store for a bit and chatted with the sales associate, who was very helpful and offered some suggestions, but I decided to hold off on the buy.  I returned a week later and low and behold the same exact fabric was on sale for 50% off!!! I forgot my debit card at home and I was traveling with very little cash.  The sales manager saw my dilemma and offered to put the fabric on a 24 hour hold.

I returned the next day and was shocked at the savings total once she rung the fabric up. The sales associate even talked me into buying scotch guard lmao!!! Nevertheless, I can't wait to see how my razzle dazzle shower curtain comes out!!!",1

My appt was with Alisia and she seemed nice enough. I used to be a stylist so I was asking her questions about what she was using on my hair and she made it sound like it was all good. I went in for root touch up and highlights. When I got home I realized that my roots looked no different, so I called Alisia and told her my roots looked they hadn't been colored, (my hair was a medium brown with blonde highlites.) She admited that she thought that may happen and to come in again I was leaving town 2 days later. She fit me in and she did my root touch up, I had told her I didn't want to have her ruin the highlites, she said it would be fine. When I left, I had about 3 inches of black color on my roots and the highlights looked like they had been growing out a year. She new she screwed up, she kept doing other things, like deep conditioning, wouldn't let me see my hair until she was done, she curled it to help hide the mess she made, she waxed my eyebrows, I didn't realize at the time she had messed uo so bad. Once I got home and the next day when I had a shower, my hair began to break off, and it looked awful! I called repeatedly to speak to the owner Lorraine, but she didn't return my calls. Alsia was on vacation and I had left town. I paid almost $200.00 for this crap service and today I have to go get my hair all cut off because of what she did to my hair. I hope whoever goes to this salon and has a bad experience walks out without paying, they don't care about the customer at all. I will make sure I post this message on every social media and any place i can so everyone knows what a bad place this can be.",-1

trn_495,"Stopped here on 9/28 for a wedding rehearsal dinner.

Our party had the upstairs dining room to ourselves, which was lovely. I loved the atmosphere of this place. It definitely have the vintage-feel and is very casual and romantic.

Our wedding party chose the chicken marsala with green beans and red potatoes, as well as a beef stir fry and a pasta with their homemade red sauce.

I caught a great glimpse of the downstairs dining area when we walked in; I fell in love with it. Dim lights, chandeliers adorning the bar that were made of glass bottles, and every employee had a shining smile on their face.

I will definitely be back to try the bar-side instead of the private-party side :)",1
trn_496,"I'm not understanding why there's not a friendly person that works at these locations. At least the 2 I've been to. Y'all be acting like the bitter auntie at a family reunion, because she can't get a man. We go to credit unions because it's more personal. More ""home-y"". I'm really starting to regret it now though.",-1
trn_497,"When you think it's just a bagel place but it's so much more!!  I'm so glad we decided to have brunch here!!  Although I've never been to the East coast I feel this place would fit right in!  I love all the freshly baked breads and desserts that they have.  I also love that you can order deli style or sit in the restaurant.  Now me and the bestie had decided to have brunch before starting our day.  When we arrived at the café at first I was like hmmmmm this looks like a business complex, which it was.  I was a bit envious of these people because they got to eat here everyday.  So we entered the café and were sat at a table quite quickly.  Surprisingly as busy as they were our drink order was taken very quickly.  We checked over the menu and anytime I come to a new place it's always hard for me to choose or go with favorites or with what the regulars get.  Because well you just never know. So anytime I want to gage a new place I always get something that is easy and simple.  I only do this because I want to see how a place makes the easiest thing on their menu.  So I got the typical everyday breakfast of bacon and eggs along with a bagel and cream cheese.  Let me tell you the food is amazing and the bagels are huge!  The bacon was just how I like it, nice and crispy and the eggs were wonderful.  Not runny or undercooked.  I really enjoyed my breakfast and without a doubt one of the best I've had.
Now onto the bakery!!!  Now I'm always a sucker for a good and delicious baked good and this café does not disappoint.  There are tons of items to choose from.  Now had I not had to travel on a plane I would have bought a few loaves of bread both regular and sweet and some cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately I don't trust my food to anyone else so maybe next time.  So I settled for a couple of Black & White cookies, which are my second favorite to chocolate chip.  Let me tell you those cookies didn't last till my trip home because I just couldn't.  
All in all I'd say I would definitely make the trip back here the next time I'm in Vegas.",1
trn_498,"Had a very enjoyable AYCE lunch. This was my fist visit but definitely not my last! It may sound weird, but they have the most flavorful sushi rice I've ever had. I've never even really noticed the rice at any of the other sushi places I've been to, but here...the rice is soooo good. You have to try it to know what I mean. 

I highly recommend the salmon kama, super white tuna, and garlic tuna. Delicious! I was so focused on eating, I forgot to take a picture.",1
trn_499,"Ive been going here for years, but something has changed slow no one answers the phone. Ive had defective part put on my car 3 times! Thats 3 times Ive had to leave my car all day to get this taken car of. And when I thought everything was fixed have to take it back for another problem. 
Now its making the same noise it had when this all started if it were a Choice I would take it else where but if its the parts Ive already paid for... so fustrating Ive paid over a $1000 dollar and its still not fixed right! 
Now I'll have to be inconvenienced one more time for an entire day without my car so they can possibly get it in and look at it to find out what it is which I'm suspecting it's the same parts which are probably defective.
Not a happy long time customer",-1

trn_501,"Solid Greek-style sandwiches and food at this little hole in the wall.

All of the pita sandwiches are pretty messy, so grab some extra napkins unless you like tahini sauce on your pants. That sounded a bit dirty, but I digress.

Gyro meat is well-seasoned and tender. Although they use a mass of ground meat instead of the more authentic layered slices of meat, Leena's offers an admirable take on the American-style ground meat gyro. The homemade yogurt sauce is much better than your run of the mill thick, mayonnaise-like condiment you usually find labelled as ""gyro sauce"" . There's a good ratio of vegetables to meat.

Falafel tends to be served lukewarm, but are nonetheless crisp and texturally complex. The spices they use in the fritters shine here, and the tahini isn't overwhelming.

Chicken shish kabob is juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned with the right amount of char. Too bad they only give you a few little pieces per sandwich.

Sides are great too. The spiced fries are crisp and bold. Yogurt rice benefits greatly from the addition of hot pepper relish and is a nice, light side dish.

Definitely the best spot in Oakland to grab a pita sandwich, forget the competition.",1

trn_504,"Maybe this should be a 5 star review.  Maybe.  I mean, if this is what you look for in appliance repair, this company is PERFECT for you.  If you want:
1) A technician to MISDIAGNOSE your appliance issue 
2) The technician (Ray) to NOT show up when he is suppose to
3) To be promised to be first on the next day's schedule, and the technician (Ray) never shows up
4) To not receive a phone call telling you that technician (Ray) will not be showing up
5) The technician (Ray) to NOT respond to your texts
6) An appliance repair company to waste and disregard your valuable time 
7) An appliance repair company that has NO RESPECT for your time

If these qualities are what you are looking for in an appliance repair place, this company is for you.  But for VOLT being a warranty repair company, this place would be out of business.  Shame on any appliance company who uses VOLT for appliance warranty work. As the girls used to say to me in high school.......... STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",-1

trn_506,"I haven't been here in about 2 years and decided to go last night. The silverware I got was dirty and had stains/food remains on it and my wine glass also had some food particles on it. So I asked for new silverware and a new wine glass. I ordered soup as an appetizer and the spoon that came with it was dirty too. I took it to the bathroom and washed it because that's the only way I could assure that it's actually CLEAN! I barely ate any of my soup and I requested the tab and left. I cannot eat in a place that does not seem clean and sanitary, that is a big issue for me. The management here really needs to look into this and make some implementations to ensure that their dishes and silverware are actually getting cleaned properly. I will not be returning.",-1
trn_507,Such an adorable alternative to the frozen yogurt options that have saturated the market. Mighty Moos makes all of their own ice cream and you can tell they really enjoy what they do.

Me and one of my girlfriend came for happy hour and it was not busy at all. Still 15 minutes before anyone paid attention to us. Food was delicious. Started with Caesar salad. It had cashews in it which was oddly amazing! My friend was in love with the mussels and we split a pizza. It was the perfect size for two. We came for happy hour which is over at 6:30 and barely got in our second glass of wine. The waiter wasn't all that attentive, but tried to make things right. I would def come back here for the food.

trn_512,"My family has been taking our pets to West Flamingo since I was a little girl. They've seen us through pet hamsters, three parakeets, two dogs, and three cats. Dr. Miller has been our vet for years. She is like an extended family member now. 

I had the sad experience of finding out my indoor cat, Musetta, had feline leukemia. It was shocking and heartbreaking. She was just shy of 10 years old. For several months, Dr. Miller and Dr. Gross helped me give her the best care possible. She lived much longer than we expected and improved for a period of time. She was almost back to her old self around Christmas. Sadly, this disease has no cure and eventually took her from me. She died in my arms at home. 

When I informed the staff (who had seen me about once a week for months) they sent me a sympathy card. All of the staff signed it and most of them wrote personal comments. I love these people more than I can express. They have been so good to me and my fur babies.",1
trn_513,"TLDR: The most amazing place I have ever been to or dealt with. You can't possibly go wrong by going here. I'm pretty sure they saved my life. 

I hadn't seen a dentist in 15 years after many painful traumatic experiences, as a child and a teenager, so my mouth was rough. I had 6 broken teeth, at least one of those with a terrible infection, and two cavities; just that I knew of. Enter Dr R. I was, to put it lightly, petrified, to see a dentist. We did the initial new patient appt on 11/20 and made a plan that I felt was not only achievable but affordable. Step one extraction of the 5 of the 6 broken teeth. On 12/13 I had those teeth ""surgically extracted"". I was beyond impressed from the minute I got there. I will explain. I took my prescribed relaxation pill before I went, when I got in the chair I put on the head set and chose spa sounds. I actually liked them. Preparing myself for the horror of a dental appointment, as I recall them. To my surprise there is now this miracle gel that exists where I no longer am tortured by the shots. I didn't feel anything at all getting the shots. Ok. I'm impressed but we'll see how it goes. Well I didn't get to see it and I'm not a looker of implements coming into my mouth, so I'm not sure exactly what was done but my teeth came out and the procedure was over. So, I honestly felt like I was in the chair 15-30 mins. I was confused at the end like ""we're done?"" Yeah, we were done. Spoiler alert: it went great. I felt no pain. I felt pressure, sure but trust me that is definitely not pain. I felt the sinus pressure that had been pounding in my head for years being relieved. It was conflicting bc I obviously didn't want to be having dental work done but it felt kind of good. I got to see the infection that was on one of my teeth and it was fascinating. I'll spare you the photos but I'm convinced that infection was going to kill me. Based on the clock in my car, the whole thing took an hour and a half from when I left my car to walk in, to when I got back in to go home. Recovery: after the anesthetic wore off I was actually fine. My right side was pain free and slightly tender the first 24 hrs then it's been like nothing ever happened there. My left side was the one with the bad infection I think, but it's definitely the one with the stitches though so it was tender for about 24 hrs but that tenderness didn't even start until hour 52. After that ""hump"" it's been great. The tenderness is gone and the stitches are pulling themselves out a little. The staff at the office has been ridiculously amazing with me; answering all 9,564 of my questions every single time I'd call. ""Are you sure it's ok for me to swallow?"" ""What if I sneeze?"" ""If I eat soup and a noodle or something gets in the back, can it just rip out my stitches by accident while I'm eating?"" They worked seamlessly with my insurance. I'm going back tomorrow, 12/20, for my follow up and I'm actually excited to go. I'm excited to have a plan. I'm excited to no longer have infected broken teeth in my mouth. I'm excited bc I have hope. 
Side note: I've been living at like a 12 on that smiley face pain chart for like 10 yrs now so I'm not sure if I'm just desensitized to pain or not but this whole time, the procedure and the recovery, never reached above a 4 on the smiley face pain chart; and that 4 was only around day 3 of recovery. This whole thing has been a walk in the park compared to what I've been living with.",1
trn_514,"Wow! The crew was so upbeat and energetic you couldn't help yourself from smiling and being in good spirits.  Even with this being their opening,  they still made time to welcome you,  shake your hand and ask if they could assist you. I was very impressed.",1

And 3 out of 5 times, they'll get the order wrong - especially if you go through the drive-thru. Don't ever leave here without checking your order! Seriously ... they get it wrong all the time. They've got free ice cream which is cool if you dine-in. My 9yo son doesn't think they care about their customers, lol. Sometimes, the restaurant doesn't seem well cared for.",0

trn_517,"Bryan at Integrity Water Solutions was recommended to us by our realtor and we were beyond impressed. From the first phone interaction with his office to the actual installation, we couldn't be more pleased.

His price was fantastic, the work was done quickly and his installers were extremely professional.

I have very temperamental skin...normal to dry complection along with hormonal/cystic acne. Some days, I'll be glowing while others I'm turning my face away from the light due to embarrassment. Skin is very important to me, and I want to make sure I treat it accordingly. My coworker mentioned Skin Laundry and how your first time is FREE! Usually it's $65 a treatment. The location is very clean and professional- and they all are very informative! I did my own research as well, and asked MANY questions... It's your skin and you're going under a laser, Ladies. ASK WHATEVER YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE!

My first visit: 
They offered their membership- but with my temperamental skin, I wanted to hold off till my 2nd visit. The specials they have are worth it! If you know you're skin will react well with the laser- DO THE MEMBERSHIP.

The process: 
You check-in.
You wash your face.
They bring you into their room.
Cleanse your face again.
Start up the treatment and discuss a routine for your skin.
10 minutes later- you're checking out! SO FAST!

Side Note:
I purchased a cleanser since the treatment was already free... what the hell! $28 bucks? Sure, let's do it! 

My Skins Reaction: 
Due to having normal to dry skin- IT REALLY DRIED me out... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE HYDRATING MASK AFTER EVERY TREATMENT- IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN TO START WITH- my personal opinion.

(Before I bought the Mask, I combined Vitamin E oil and Aloe- works like a charm for a home remedy)
But if you want added benefits, their hydrating mask is the way to go. 

Shelby helped me with some questions over the phone and I felt like she was very confident with the brand and helped me out alot! Thank You! 

And the Technician was amazing as well- I didn't catch her name but I'm sure they are all great! 

Go treat yourself to a free treatment on your next day off!

It is so worth it.",1

I had my hair cut here on Wednesday, and I've got to say I am thoroughly impressed by the attention to detail and the passion overflowing in this salon.

Special thanks to Kiana for doing a wonderful job. Keep it up!",1
trn_521,"Interesting. I guess everyone has different experiences with this company. In my case I just needed to do a quick move as I had a deadline to move out and I was running out of time. I just needed all the big furniture moved using someone else's muscles and backbones. A friend suggested I rent a truck and spend a weekend doing it with his help - but when I did the math, it seemed worth it to pay a little more and leave the heavy lifting to someone else. The chiropractor bills alone would probably cost more than the service these guys provide. These guys give you a range of about an hour for when they'll show up. Luckily for me they showed up near the end of that range because I was still staging all the furniture near the entrance to help accelerate the whole process. The bulk of the time was taken up by the actual drive across town. Everything else was very quick and smooth. The two folks that did my move were VERY professional and quite obviously very experienced as they suggested things I didn't even consider to make the move go smoothly. The best part about it was that it was so quick and smooth I was able to go to work just an hour later than usual rather than having to take the whole day off just to do this.",1

I would suggest NEVER having a wedding here if you want your guests to actually eat dinner.  I have been to numerous weddings...had my own wedding... and have NEVER heard of guests not being served dinner.,-1
trn_525,"Cool place. Great atmosphere. Excellent ""grocery"" selection. They stock a lot of local items like pickles from that pickling guy at the farmers markets. Queen Creek Olive company items. I didn't think anything from the market was overpriced. The produce selection seemed quite reasonable. And the beer selection was great. I tried the BBQ as well, and I thought it was pretty damn good. I got the BBQ tacos not knowing what to expect but bbq + taco = awesome! What is nice about the bbq is that it is not swimming in sauce already. You choose your sauce and slather it on appropriately. I thought the bbq was a tad expensive but that is because my view is anchored to a little bbq shack in the middle of georgia where a sandwich would be 4. Drop that shack in N Scottsdale and I understand a 8 price. The 3 tacos were $10 and I'm full from eating 3/4 of it. So, figure 3.33 a taco, that is pretty reasonable considering the quality. And looking at other bbq joints around here, the price is comparable. Add the atmosphere, awesome sauces (low country may go down as my favorite), and great staff I think they have a winning combo. The hard part will be getting customers to that location. Its convenient from the 101 but not many folks travel on Bell Rd. I hope they kick ass.",1
trn_526,I love this place it's like a hidden secret in Vegas. We made a reservation for my birthday because it was in our hotel and we were completely wowed!  The next time we were in Vegas we ate here again and didn't disappoint!  If you have the chance don't pass it up!,1
trn_527,"I gave 3 stars for the great atmosphere, service and beautiful [huge] outdoor patio. We enjoyed sitting at the bar near the patio (which will accommodate large group gatherings). The reason Dakota didn't get 5 stars is because the food is mediocre at best. We have been here twice now. Last time my cob salad was really lacking and not as described on the menu. I had to request a couple of items named on the menu. This visit my fiancee ordered the skirt steak as his entree. It is only a few tasteless thin strips of the steak on top of a pile of french fries. He ordered it medium-rare and it was well-done, tough and chewy, however, the chimmichuri sauce on the side was good. I ordered my hamburger with ""salad"" instead of french fries, which was a big pile of greens on the plate dumped out of a bag, nothing else. The grilled onions and provolone cheese that I paid $3 extra for (making it $16) were a thin slice of cheese and the amount of onions under the cheese was so small I couldn't even taste them. If they had been included, I probably wouldn't care so much, but you pay extra for them! (At least cheese should be included on a $13 hamburger.) To the restaurant's credit, the burger was cooked Medium as ordered, and Mike's entree was comped. Someone needs to rework the limited menu, and the kitchen needs a Chef's supervision and/or more talented cooks. I do need to comment on the EXCELLENT service we received from Madison, who was very pleasant and attentive.",0

It's little details like that take a place from good to great. They even have a vegetarian menu, so my sister was especially pleased. My whole family enjoyed their meals. I got the lettuce wraps, which were great and the truffled mac and cheese as a side dish. The mac and cheese was heavenly, very rich and filling. Also the chocolate souffle for desert was incredible! Just the right amount of rich and gooey on the inside!

Will absolutely return.",1

trn_534,"If I were to sum this place up... 
I'd say: Inexpensive & Tasty. 
Service is eh. Sushi is good for the price. I come here frequently. 
Introduced quite the number of friends who are in town visiting- all love this place, and mostly rave about, ""how fun it is."" I suppose there is something fun about watching your food travel on the revolving bar! 
A drawback however is having to wait for a particular roll because everyone sitting ahead of you in the rotation got first dibs and grabbed em' all up! For example, the Vegas rolls. (am I right?!) =)
9 out of 10 times I've been seated immediately. For the most part I'd say they're generally pretty efficient about that. 
It's fantastic to get your bill, only to realize after all that sushi, you've spent less than $10!",1
trn_535,"We ordered here a couple times for lunch. The signature burger is delicious. I've tried the sig. burger with chili once and egg on another occasion. The chili rivals fatburgers chili and is very tasty. My coworkers always order the milkshakes and look tasty. We have been ordering hotdogs and sliders on tuesdays for the past 3 weeks now, for there special.

I removed a star, cuz on 2 different cases. 2 coworkers received the wrong order. 1 case was wrong size burger and 2 it was missing something.",1

The wings weren't exotic, nor unique, nor anything that exceeds mediocre. However, my overall experience warrants a solid 4-star rating. If I ever find myself meandering along Aurora Road, I will be sure to stop by again!",1

It is expensive for sure, which is why I recommend that you try it the first time for lunch!  They have a $28 lunch tasting menu.  The Clam Chowder at RM Seafood is amazing. Definitely the best I have ever had anywhere! I'm not kidding, better than anything I have had in Boston or San Francisco or other great Seafood cities.  I liked it so much I asked for the recipe and they gave it to me!!!  The Lobster Rolls and the Korean Flat Iron Steak are great as well. They do some creative things with their desserts as well definitely try the Ice Cream tasting and Key Lime Pie!! I have been there several times. Go there at lunch instead of dinner. The prices are about half as much for pretty much the same dishes. The service is also excellent!",1

Their chocolate chip rosemary cookies are just chewy enough while still remaining their integrity. The orange scones crumble to perfection. The goat cheese quesadilla is one of the best quesadillas I've ever had, and it comes with a jalapeño marmalade that I would totally buy a jar of if they sold it. The interior is cool and hip, they've got assorted house plants growing in every corner. Come early for good seating and parking. Stay late because you won't want to leave this place.",1
trn_541,"This place is soooo good. We had three different margaritas and for different apps. Tons of food for three people and super good. Everything was great! Really enjoyed the prickly pear Marg and the Pom berry Marg. Awesome. Cool atmosphere. Nice, helpful, attentive staff. This place is a great choice.",1
trn_542,"We were going to Social House for my sushi-aficionado-friend's birthday. I was skeptical when her husband asserted, ""The best meal I've ever eaten was at Social House."" Not wanting to be disappointed, I walked in with small expectations, hoping for good sushi and nice atmosphere. When we entered Crystals, which is a high-end shopping mall, I became very skeptical. 

But I forget. This is Vegas; a place that can truly surprise you at every turn with it's ability to take the seemingly ordinary and make it extravagant. Social House's atmosphere was filled with the swanky lighting, decor, and music that you can find only in Sin City.  

We decided to go with the chef's menu. Meaning, the 6 of us dining spouted off things we didn't like (cucumber and salmon) and left the rest to the chef. Course after course came out with each one better than the next. The dishes were perfectly cooked (when applicable), dressed in the best of sauces, and presented beautifully. Yellowtail sashimi, kobe beef sliders, edamame (I know, it seems weak, but it was phenomenal), and a ginormous roll platter. There were several other dishes, but I can't even remember everything! It ran pretty pricey- about $100 per person, but if you're open to trusting the chef and trying a smattering of dishes, it will not disappoint! 

It was the best meal I've ever eaten.",1
trn_543,Dont take your special needs son in this shop. I decided to take him to this shop for his love of super heros and the chick behind the counter was the rudest most uncomfortable person to deal with. I thought it was just..you know (everyone has a bad day). Nope this chick is consistent with the bad attitude.,-1
trn_544,"The only thing I can say anything positive about the place was the guy who took my order -- he was polite and competent.  He seemed a little afraid of the woman preparing the food, seemed furious, flinging gobs of food into the woks with a scary expression on her face.  She slammed the container on the counter when it was ready, and when I asked for a bag she practically threw it at me.  I felt sorry for her -- she really seemed ready to lose it.

The food was disgusting.  They advertise yellow, red, and green curry, but what I got could more precisely be described as gray curry.  The vegetables were boiled and rubbery and tasted vaguely like vinegar, or something.  The rice was overcooked.  It was all unsalted and unseasoned.  No curry.  No pepper.  Nothing.  

I threw it away.  From now on I will always read Yelp reviews, because there are many like mine about this place.",-1

trn_546,"I became a patient of Dr. Gary Brigham's practice in June 2014. To say my smile has improved is an understatement. My smile has TRANSFORMED! 
When I started Invisalign, people would always say, ""you already have straight teeth!"" But Invisalign is so much more than that. The truth is, my bite wasn't where it should be, causing a lot of damage to my teeth. Luckily, I found Brigham Orthodontics who helped show me what Invisalign is all about. Before Invisalign, I thought how complicated it must be. That hasn't been my experience at all with Dr. Brigham. He and his staff really make the whole process easy. They go above and beyond for their patients. You can feel the love and care they have on every visit. We aren't just patients, we are family! 
Thanks to Dr. Brigham and his wonderful staff I am a much more confident person. I definitely have something to smile about",1

trn_548,"It pains me to write this, but I am no longer a fan of Vintner Grill.

My husband and I were seated a nice table for our anniversary dinner last night.  We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and decided on an appetizer.  In the past, we have ordered cheese plates but we decided to order:

*Crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli ($12)

I wish we didn't order it.  It was rubbery and the aioli had a very strange flavor.  After eating two rings of calamari, I had enough of the rubber.  Surprisingly enough, the waiter never asked how the appetizer was. 

But he did come over to ask what we wanted as a main course.  I'm guessing there weren't any specials of the night, since it was never offered.

I ordered:
*Seared sea scallops with saffron risotto, english peas, fennel, pea sprouts and roasted pepper relish ($31)
-The scallops were MASSIVE and very good.  But the risotto tasted like a box of rice-a-roni (yuck!)  The roasted pepper relish that was on top of each scallop was unnecessary as it caused the inside of the scallops to turn pink, which then makes you think, ""could this be raw inside?""

My husband ordered:
*Durham ranch wagyu sirloin with parsnip puree, baby vegetables and balsamic-port reduction ($27)
-He said it was good, but the wagyu at T-Bones at Red Rock (if you can believe it!) was MUCH better.  In fact any wagyu that he has had anywhere else was better than this.

We ordered our dessert to go:
Which was a trifle with granola, strawberries and pound cake.  It was yummy!

There are restaurants in the area that have better food; the ambiance at Vintner Grill is terrific- but that is what you are paying for.

Unfortunately, I am no longer a fan and will not be visiting anymore.  Such a shame since I live about five minutes away.",-1
trn_549,"What a gorgeous shop!! Vida Moulin is a gem. The goods for sale are beautifully curated, the atmosphere is warm and inviting and Chantell is as kind as she is stylish. She has a 'succulent bar' set up where you can choose from a sweet assortment of pots, choose a baby succulent and have it potted right there in the shop.

Be sure to try their renowned pineapple upside down cake and the molten chocolate cake, both are baked to order. You have never tasted anything like Roy's take on Asian fushion, and somebody told me the food is all spicy but that is not so! The blending of flavors is deftly accomplished, so that no one ingredient ever stands out excessively. Service is attentive. And I do not know of ANY other place that makes your special celebration day this special, and it is accomplished in the most elegant style. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night, and we were treated like visiting royalty. Perfect!",1

trn_556,"I came in after I saw an ad on Facebook- I have wanted to try Crossfit for a while but I've been hesitant because I'm not very fit, and I didn't know if I could keep up. Neil signed me up for a trial and my first WOD was led by Harmon.  They both made me feel so welcomed - and provided a ton of attention and instruction during class so I could keep up- Harmon is awesome -he has been basically working 1:1 with me for my first couple sessions  and everyone in the group is so supportive and encouraging - I ended my trial early and decided to sign up because I'm just loving it. The WODIFY app is really cool, literally everyone I met is incredibly nice and encouraging and it's a really cool diverse crowd - while I'm excited to eventually not be the fattest and slowest of the group- I really don't feel like an outsider and it's only been a week - If you are like me and have wanted to try but haven't taken the plunge- just do it",1

It was very good and had a decent amount of selections (the buffet) for a small, locally owned place.  The Garden Cafe even has a omelet bar that was very good.  The price is excellent for what you get.  I would much rather come here for a small buffet then go and spend another $3-5 more per person at Golden Corral for a lot of stuff I will not eat anyway.  Plus, eating here helps a local business.  We will be coming back a lot!",1

Its Queens Feast this week --they had so many choices and let me just say they did not pare down the size of the portions. We were greeted by the most friendly and competent staff of servers...a couple were related to the Owner..(daughter and son ). We sat down and Joanne brought us our menu's and some bread and a white bean relish. This was my choice. I went with the Prosciutto and Burrata Appetizer, Then the Veal with Artichoke and Lemon, and then the Torta Chocolatina. Everything was delicious, no skimping on the portions and it was prepared with love. I will be coming back - again and again. I wish I had tried it sooner ..Don't wait..go and try Dolce.",1

I've eaten there in February, March & May. Service was great. Owner very friendly. This is my new favorite sushi restaurant.",1
trn_564,"Great fast food place. Great service and decent Indian food, flavors and quality for fast service. Chipotle-style with different option combinations and price. They don't make the food right in front of you, but you can see their ovens and food stations behind enclosed glass. Very clean, slick and open inside.

If you're looking for authentic food, you may want to find a sit-down place (e.g., Jaipur Junction far away in Hudson is my favorite). However, this establishment pulls off this newer fast food concept very well, with friendly service.

Quality of meat (e.g., lamb) could improve but the naan was tasty. The food is a tad oily for me, but I overall really like this place.

----

The chicken tikka masala definitely improved in taste since being here last, months ago.  Grilled chicken and I enjoyed the fact I could combine the mango sauce and tikka masala sauce myself.  I also really enjoyed my mango lassi.",1
trn_565,"LOVE  at 1st sight.....so refreshing to see light fixtures & accessories that are ""NOT"" more of the same.....applauds!! 
Having moved just a week ago from Santa Barbara, Ca. where the architecture is sooo warm & inviting I really appreciated Leslie Harris's (proprietor) creative eye. 
I connected with her sense of boho chic dress style, I felt like I was back in S.B. :) ...I met Leslie in her shop and she was down to earth and her whole entire staff was very sweet! 

After several recommendations from locals (to be clear Leslie did not recommend Hickory Mart) that ""Hickory Furniture Mart"" was the place to go my daughter & I decided to make the trip, boy were we disappointed 
:/ 
In MY humble opinion I found the furniture to be overpriced, stores were pretty repetitive not to mention I felt like MANY pieces were a decade ago. No sense of ""fresh eyes"" for the exception of customizable pieces. 

(back to Southern Nest) 
AFTER visiting ""Hickory Furniture Mart"" I have more appreciation for Southern Nest, truly a hidden gem! As a business owner myself I much rather support non corporate local businesses. 

Highly recommend!!",1
trn_566,"Overall, at best, it was a half decent show. It was about an hour and 15 minutes long. Luckily, the tickets I had, I got through Travel Zoo, so 2 tickets for the front row were $50. Considering it was a Vegas show, I felt I got what I paid for. 

The main reason for the two star rating, I really felt he spent too much time promoting his book and DVD. It was beginning to feel like a lecture as to why I should buy his items. And then, in my opinion, to make you feel even worse, he says he will be out there after the show with his son. I really felt like I was on a guilt trip. 

I thought the jokes were so-so at best and from the rest of the audiences reaction, I could tell I was not alone. Although this is a small theatre to begin with, less than 50% of the seats were filled. 

Bottom line, for $50 for two tickets, I got mediocre humor and mild entertainment. I've seen MANY shows in Vegas and this, unfortunately is near the bottom.",-1
trn_567,Decent selection but probably better on a night with specials.  We went on a Monday night and a lot of the food was dried out.  The fish made my husband's stomach upset- and he usually has a stomach of steel.  I would say there are many better options for restaurants in downtown- Not worth the decent price.,-1

Currently under renovations so soon there will be a new yoga room etc, can't wait! The new parking garage has already opened which helps with parking since a lot of people go to this gym. (How you know when it's good?). 

The class instructors are awesome, keep good pace, play good music, make you sweat ;) all while making it fun & mixing it up. I enjoy not having to think about my workout so I do take classes. Here are some of my favorites:
Barre- with Julie! (Or anything with her, Pilates, etc)
Strength Conditioning- Stephanie
Athletic Conditioning- Greg
Yoga- Erin 

I love that they have child care here!",1
trn_569,"This store being a place for supplies to keep myself beautiful (self-assessment) should have garnered at least five stars. I mean, I love a one-stop shop where I can indulge in beautiful make-up, find things for my hair, my nails, every part of me! What I don't enjoy is bad employees. 

The employees here, I THINK, are working on commission. Went in to buy a fabulous Clarisonic for my face and immediately two women swooped in to help. I have to believe this is not because they are the friendliest bunch, but because there is a payoff for them. Mainly because once one girl edged out the other one she was trying to sell me the door knobs. 

So, the truth is, I'm 44. That is bad in a lot of ways, but fabulous in that I know what I need in order to look good. I've been doing this for a long time. So, talk to the girl about this product and tell her I use a certain brand of cleanser. I love it, I will not part with it, I don't need recommendations to change it. I just need to know if it's safe to use with the apparatus I'm about to buy. She tells me yes, but she has an even BETTER face wash. I tell her that I understand my skin, but she keeps pushing. After a few minutes she stopped, realizing defeat. I then asked for my fave moisturizer, EVER. She again tried to tell me that wasn't blah blah. No, point me to it, thank you. By the time I got through my list of beauty needs I was exhausted! 

So, on the one hand, they have the overly helpful staff (read: pushy), but I walked up to this one girl who quickly tried to turn her back on me as she saw me coming. That wasn't obvious. I asked her, to her back, if she could tell me where I could find a certain section. She grudgingly pointed. Well, thanks for trying to do your job. That you get paid for.

Went up to the counter to ask for help with some eye shadow. No one had a clue, but if people kept pointing me to places where I might be able to find it, I was going to throw down on the ground and start flailing. If I was paid to do your job I'd at least act like I didn't totally hate it and wish it would die.

Anyway, the only reason this store gets three stars is because it has everything I need for my beauty regimen, otherwise zero stars for the incredible helpfulness of the employees.",0
trn_570,I remember going to this salon a few years ago and I loved how fast thier service was(under 45 min). I'm glad that that hasn't changed. I did a refill on my seaweed bio gel nails with an air brushed french manicure because I saw it here on yelp and I didn't even know that was an option. My nail tech was nice she understood what I wanted and was very fast( without sacrificing quality). Sadly my only complain is that this place is located in markham which is out of my way. It would be cool if they opened up another location in the north York or downtown area.,1

trn_573,"It was ... sort of okay. The service was ""doing their duty"" and nothing more. There are two restaurants here: ""Fred's not here"" and ""The red tomato"". When I came in I asked the waiter which is the Fred's and he just laughed and went away. Okay, there were two big signs that I had overlooked. My fault. But even if so, it was sort of u professional and rude.

The all so famous crab soup was a tad too spicy leaving few room for the crab taste. And the ""Canadian Prime N.Y. Strip Steak (16 oz.) with Duck Fat Frites & Vegetables""? Well, the vegetables were a few long green beans. The Duck Fat Frites were just disgusting - I could not eat them. Tasted like fried in many-days-old fat. And the steak? Well ... it was okay. Nothing special. Not bad, but also not good.
So, could at least a nice presentation save what could be saved? Unfortunately not. It was presented without any love looking like done by someone who doesn't enjoy his job.

Do, no, I cannot follow all the positive recommendations. My general experience of ""avoid restaurants where they have paper table cloths"" just proofed to be true again.

By the way, the restaurant was relatively empty on a Sunday evening.",-1

I am very picky about my hair and always have trouble finding the right stylist for me. I have never been to a barber before Noble Wolf so I was a little nervous going in. However, I immediately felt comfortable when I walked in as well as throughout the cut. Roxy is very personable and spends her time making sure the cut is just right. She does exactly what I ask for! I have a platinum pixie cut, and I get my hair cut in between bleaches so I have roots. She blends the blonde to the roots so well I actually think my roots look good! I used to HATE when my roots would show, but she makes it look artsy! I would 100% recommend this shop to men and women. Roxy will not disappoint!

And she just move her from left to right, giving us a disgusting face again and pulling the menus away from us.... We turn around and left.

Horrible.

The place smelled like a three inch road trip inside the lower colon of sick deer.

Every employee with whom I spoke had apparently awoken on the wrong side of the bed. Not a smile to be found. 

And my lettuce was rotten, wilted and brown. That is inexcusable in a restaurant, and surprising to encounter at a national franchise. Who's in charge here? Makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too.

Stick with the guys whose door is propped open with customers waiting to get in. An empty restaurant like Qdoba speaks for itself.",-1

Most were non-veg and weren't very enthusiastic about their choices. Even the vegetarian in the group wasn't very impressed. She got the Southern Combo and really liked the unchicken although not the rest. I tried the mac 'n cheese from her dish and was put off. The texture was fine but the flavour was an odd spicy flavour - not appetizing at all. I had the Unchicken Burger. The unchicken was very good but the rest of the burger very plain with no flavour - it really needed better toppings. We tried the fried oreos which was the only item I though was enjoyable. The staff was very friendly and attentive though, which helped me add another star to my review. This might be considered good for strict vegans, but don't think most non-vegetarians would enjoy it....",0

The bread was nicely toasted, bacon was on point, and the overall taste of the sandwich had great flavor and texture. I would go to this place again next time I am in the area. 

The staff is very friendly, but with all the noise behind them you may have to ask them to speak up. They have a nice wood country feel in the interior.",1
trn_598,"The service was very good so was appetizers and main but for me the dessert failed so I had to take some points off.  Otherwise I would have given this 4 stars.  If I did have time I would go back again, for the steak.

I had Escargots for appetizers - loved it.  Very aromatic with the herbs and I particularly liked the combination of the champignons with the escargots themselves.

For main I ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin with side of vegetables which included sauteed mushrooms, grilled red and yellow pepper and squash.  Steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare and I dare say it really was most flavorful steak I have tasted in a long time.  The slight charred flavor of the accompaniments and sweetness of the pepper played off the steak wonderfully.

I should have stopped there.  Being a dessert person, I tried the trio of minis - which was a butter tart with vanilla ice-cream, fudge brownie with caramel, hot fudge whipped cream and ice-cream and finally a passion fruit crème brulée.  Value for money, that seems like a great deal for $8.  However the best thing on the plate for me were the ice-cream.  The Butter Tarte wasn't bad and tasted a little like a pecan pie without pecan.  Brulee was fine but nothing to rave about.  Brownie was the biggest failure.  Probably made earlier in the evening and by the time I ate (wasn't that late, only 9pm) it was like a piece of dried chocolate cake drowned in overly sweet fudge sauce.",0
trn_599,"I'm going to assume for the sake of this review that people still cook (and bake)...  Because if you are looking for microwave meals, you will not find them here.  (but I am excited to try their soup mixes, and their jars of prepared soup this fall!)

Since the peddler opened I have been singing their praises all over the neighborhood.  Absolutely the best (and cheapest) deli in the area by far, the bulk spices and pantry area is insane!  I have paid twice as much for quinoa at ""big bird""...  The bakery is home produced, (aside from some breads)...  And the best part is, if you want something on a regular basis that they don't carry, or even if you just want something once, they will order it for you!  My first trip there, I needed baking soda (I bake with it, clean with it, I use a lot!)  and they for some reason didn't have any.  I asked the guy working, who wrote it down on a notepad and told me it would be in the following Wednesday!  Then, I overheard a customer a few weeks later talking to them about getting a pig for a Hawaiian style pig roast (they had it for him the next week!).  What national chain orders something they don't carry for you?  Order if available online, sure, but not something they don't carry! (Hell, my ""big bird"" wouldn't even cut me bone-in sirloin)

The food peddler is not going to completely replace every grocery store from your life, but it is really nice to go to a neighborhood market, with friendly people every week instead of fighting crowds and waiting in line for 20 minutes.",1
trn_600,Was very excited for happy hour and heard great things. Food was less then average we were charged $10 for BREAD.

The line is always long and noisy, the store has debris all over the floor, I do like their late hours and giving a star for that. Going to Baskin Robbins from now on",-1
trn_603,The food may be decent but their service / people working here are completely clueless. I've ordered takeout a handful of times and have been disappointed every time. I literally walk in and the people working there have no clue where my order is or if it even exists. There is ZERO communication between their employees and they leave patrons guessing / trying to convince their staff that we did infact order at it should already be ready. My last order said 15 minutes until it would be ready and I still waited almost an addition hour (50 minutes) until the food was actually done.,-1

trn_607,"Huge waste of money and time.

I should have checked Yelp before I came here. If I could give this place negative stars, I would. 
$65 later, I had to go home and detail the car myself. 

Victor was a nice guy, but I didn't spend that much money to have a nice conversation and still have a dirty car. 

While the pamphlet said $5 and up for pet hair, they charged a minimum of $50 just for the pet hair removal, and $14 for the wash. 

The car was still covered in dirt inside and out, and the floor mats looked like they hadn't even been touched. 

I will never be back, and I suggest reading these reviews before you consider coming here. Especially if you have pets.",-1

trn_609,"I have dined here twice now and have found the food of good value and the service efficient and courteous. Both times we were off to a play and our timeliness was never in jeopardy.

The decor is a little odd because of the huge entry way that turns into a dance club later at night, but the ambiance is otherwise comfortable and quiet. To date, I have had the veal scallopini twice: slight hint of lemon and herbs, tender and flavourful. Although the presentation of the prosciutto and melon was somewhat hohum, the melon was firm without being underripe and the prosciutto was well-cured without being tough or stringy. We also had the straciatella soup, which came piping hot and delicately flavoured.

In all, we have not been disappointed with the food, service, or the value. We'll be back.",1

trn_614,A friend of mine recommended this place. So we checked it out- very old school Italian. The menu is posted to the wall and meals come with a house wine. You can also order off a wine list. Excellent meal the marinara sauce was one of he best I've ever had. The cappuccino at the end of the meal was wonderful and the tiramisu was to die for! Definitely recommend.,1
trn_615,We all know this place is new however there is No excuse for the Terrible service. This is my second time here and the food is not bad but the poor service is ridiculous. It took 15 minutes to get a menu and another 15 minutes to get a waiter.,-1
trn_616,We LOVED this place! The sangria was the best I've ever had and I'm a sangria snob. We only ordered the chicken chicharrones and the octopus because we were full but can't wait to go back to try more of the menu because it looks awesome. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome! I would give 10 stars if I could!,1
trn_617,"I have yet to eat the pick up order I placed but this is my first time here and I felt compelled to review. We were driving home from Xmas shopping and so we enlisted Yelp to find a place for food. The parking lot was full, inside bar and tables were full, and people poured in for take out orders. Multiple people came in and knew the bartender by name as did she them. There were even gifts exchanged by patrons and staff. The bartender Connie knew small details of each customer like how many mustards or which wine to pour as they waited for food. Even if our food ends up being lackluster, which I'm sure is far from what it will be based in the mouthwatering pictures from other reviews, the first impression was amazing!!! Looking forward to returning already!!


Edit: food is A+!",1
trn_618,"Cool atmosphere.

Waiter who looked like Sam Smith was kind of annoying. Kept coming to the table trying to rush us or get us to purchase more cocktails. I could understand if it was a full house and you wanted to turn the table ASAP but it was half empty dude. Relax.

I ordered the Cauliflower Buffalo bites which were very delicious. Crispy, hot, tasty dipping sauces. I also got the Grapevine cocktail which was also on point.

I would return here at some point and/or recommend it.",0
trn_619,"I love French cuisine!!! I am so happy I found a home cooked French cuisine in Charlotte. I am so happy I finally experience this place! My first impression as soon as I walk inside the door, I instantly feel warm, cozy and right at home. We had an early dinner on a Saturday night, probably the third table to be seated. The hostess immediately sat us at a very corner of the restaurant with a window view to the outdoor garden patio. My back was against the wall sitting on a very long wooden church bench, a pew. Within 30 minutes, the place was packed and the tables were filled up.

I was hungry and saving my appetite all day. I proceeded to order a chicken liver salad that came with a nice warm poached egg on top. I also ordered a glass of risling. The moment I took my first bite, my palet were opening up to total heaven!!! It made sitting on the church pew feel  more heavenly. By far, one of the best salad I had in Charlotte! (True meaning of Yum Salad. It is a famous salad in South East Asia). If I can lick the juice of the plate, I would. Luckily for my date, the waitress brought the spoon for me to scrap every juice of the dressing left on my plate!! YUM!!! By this time, the French owner came over and introduce himself as Fabrice! Very nice guy.

For my main course, I ordered the duck breast with artichoke, cooked as the chef would recommend. The duck breast was plumb and juicy, slightly more cooked than what I was used to, but it was still delish! The cream sauce was slightly heavy for me as I took my time sipping on my merlot chatting with my conservative attorney date who was not too familiar with French dining. He ordered overcooked steak and french fries! Bless his heart!

I love this place and  the location which is close to uptown and on a trendy mixed cultural district of Charlotte, Central Avenue!!",1
trn_620,Excellent Italian restaurant. The food was wonderful and it was a nice place for a special occasion. The specials were lengthy but all sounded appealing. More of a nice night out than a family friendly kind of place. The ciopinno special was served on a platter and tasted as stunning as it looked.,1
trn_621,"If I were to rate this venue based only on service and how the bar's ambience made it easy for me to ""let my hair down,"" I would easily give 3.5 stars, but for now, I can only say ""A-OK,"" due to the limited selection of food.  (An ""A-OK"" from me is still pretty good!  I rarely give four stars after only one visit, but when I do, you better believe I was impressed with service, food, beverages, low ambient noise pollution, and delightful atmosphere!)  Rott n' Grapes is listed on Yelp as a venue with tapas/plates, but it really is more of a ""wine and beer bar,"" with bar snacks as somewhat just an afterthought.  There's an impressive chalkboard written with multi-colored chalk, and with such a large list of wines and beers, I was overwhelmed.  What a relief when my eyes adjusted and somehow found Caymus Conundrum.  I was with a friend, who's never heard of Conundrum, but was willing to try a bottle (!) on my word (!!) that it was good.  Bartender Jason backed me up on how great the Conundrum line is, and with a free app from a selection of three with the purchase of a bottle, how can we go wrong?  With my friend's power of persuasion, he was able to get a credit for the app and have it applied to the charcuterie board, instead.  Another win!  (This was after my friend spoke to the other bartender about the possibility, and not Jason.)

There was a bit of confusion when Jason poured us a glass of red, when we told the other bartender that we wanted white, but Jason didn't even bat an eye, obtained a chilled bottle of white and immediately poured us two glasses, and then placed the bottle into a wine chiller.  The tiny charcuterie board (normally $15, but $12 during HH) came with extra-sharp white cheddar (my favorite of the three), triple-cream Brie, and Manchego; salted almonds, a mix of olives; a couple of dates; salami and prosciutto; and toasted half (?) of a small baguette brushed with EVOO.  We ended up asking for more bread, so thanks to Jason for indulging us!

trn_623,"I just had lunch and I have to say it was the worst Mexican food I have ever had, extremely bland and nothing to it. The chicken enchiladas just had boiled chicken in them, no cheese, sauce or onions/peppers and the sauce on top was bland.

Don't waste your time or money here go anywhere else!!!",-1
trn_624,If I could give zero stars I would. I bought a used car from this dealer and was told that ALL of their cars are inspected before selling. I was rear-ended by someone and when my insurance company inspected the damages they found evidence of damage from a prior accident. I called Volvo of Tempe and spoke to the sales manager and of course he denied knowing about the prior accident. This dealer is very shady. They sold me a dangerous vehicle and won't own up to it. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!!! I can't warn you enough.,-1

After having my idea to go bowling vetoed, we went here to kill some time before heading out for the evening and to grab some snacks (and apparently consistently lose money on the horses!) I had been here several times, so I already knew we were in for a treat, but my other half was new to the spot. 
They DID NOT disappoint! Everything was fantastic, the server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled, and we had a great time. I had never tried the fried pickles, but if you go, be sure to order them, they are YUMMTASTIC and everyone is always very friendly.",1

It is on top of the hotel. This hotel has been redone but use to be a total dive so people don't realize they should check it out.  Great location on the strip too. 

This area is mostly outdoors with part of the night club stage covered. There are 2 pools and lounge seating. Full bar and second floor. Ya.  A second floor on the rooftop.  

You have 180 degrees of Vegas up here too.  It's absolutely beautiful.",1

She did an excellent job and was very friendly. Ashley listened to everything I had to say regarding how I like my hair cut and took her time to get it just right. She did a great drop fade. 

Regular haircut is $21. The place was small, but clean enough. I read a lot of complaints regarding bad customer service but that wasn't my experience. It was like most barber shops I've been to, they don't have front receptionist like hair salons, so you have to let you presence be known. Overall good experience.",1

There were TONS of tempting items to choose from... ultimately my wife and I shared the Cauliflower Tacos, Potato Tacos, and Street Corn. All I can say is ""Wow!"". The food here is fantastic! Not just in flavor, but in presentation and sheer  creativity in the flavor combos. Never in a million years did I expect a restaurant that specializes in vegan and vegetarian fare to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, however this place earned its spot near the top of the list of places I'll be frequenting on a regular basis. Absolutely delicious.",1
trn_631,"Where to begin...I don't think there is one thing that I did not like about this place! I finally got a chance to visit this hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale on a Wednesday evening around 7pm. The ambiance itself was breathtaking. It is truly what I would  picture a hidden garden to be like lit with candles throughout the dining area. Seating is limited and you must call in advance. You have the option to be seated inside or outside and I would highly recommend you reserve a seat in the garden if you are looking for fireworks this place has to offer. It literally screams ROMANCE!!! As of now, there is about a 2 week wait to reserve seating on both Friday and Saturday.

My friend and I were blessed to have Christian Lewkowicz, the new owner of Cafe Monarch, wait on us throughout the evening. He provided us with a the history of how Cafe Monarch came to be, his vision, the personal touch he has made to the decor including his lovely display of his grandmother's paintings throughout the restaurant and the much more. 

The menu changes daily for dinner they offer an amuse bouche, salad, main course, and a dessert as their pre-fixed offerings. The portions are much larger than I thought they would be. I loved the idea of a pre-fixed menu, because it helps those who tend to choose the same thing every meal to live outside the box! Overall, the food was cooked to perfection and arrived at the right time every time:) 

To end the night Christian Lewkowicz took his already over the top customer service to a whole new level and offered to give us a private tour of the kitchen, which was the icing on the cake. It was a much smaller set up than I imagined and it still amazes me how much work and creativity comes out of such a small space.

I am already planning my next visit for brunch with my girlfriends and look forward to another priceless experience:) Thanks Christian!",1

trn_636,"Ok went there on 11/25/16 at around 9pm. Looked like they were ready to close (an hour later).  We had around 45 people. GREAT service to a degree.  While I applaud the attentiveness, some of the food came out way after the rest which included a chicken salad (grilled) and a couple of fried chicken breast sandwhiches. ALL the chicken sandwhiches after taking a bite were completely RAW.  I called the manager over and she PROFUSELY appogized and informed us that when she saw our large group enter she asked the kitchen manager to stay and help, they REFUSED!! And essentially left her to hang out to dry. Metro Pizza you should find this UNACCEPTABLE and hold your kitchen manager accountable. The female manager on duty should be applauded for the way she handled it. RAW chicken can KILL people. You can call me at 661-742-9465 and we can discuss it if you want. Because of the way it was handled I'll give 3 stars.",0

I love the super contemporary and casual feel to the place.  The music made me feel like I was in a nightclub (good tunes and mixes) but it does not suit everyone in our party.  Oh well!  

We were greeted immediately and sat upstairs.  The place only had about 6 tables total during the lunch rush (not too good).  The served free homemade chips and salsa.  The chips are warm, fresh, and super super crisp.  I love them.  I didn't even need salsa for the chips.  They are AWESOME!  The best chips I have ever had.  Yes, EVER!  

I love the simple menu.  I opted out for the one of the specials, quesadilla with chicken street meat and cheese.  The tortilla was just very good not just like a regular flour store brought kind, this sucka was fresh.  The chicken street meat was the BOMB (slow roasted and braised with garlic clove, rosemary, and citrus juices).  OMG, PARTY in my mouth!  The rest of the party ordered the signature tacos and came with arroz gonulas and Cuban black beans.  The arroz gondulas and Cuban black beans looked so good.  Next time!

I could have returned my sandwich but I was hungry. Additionally, the bologna sandwich only had three pieces of meat.

This new location is nice because there isn't usually a wait and they have the same menu as the other location....plus it's right by my yoga studio (cuz after yoga, I need some pizza...duh!). I went with my mom and we shared their super simple salad, which was good, but plain with just a light vinaigrette, and we had a half bianco verde half rosa pizza. The pizza was soooo good. Better than I remember from the other location (the lack of the wait time may have helped too). I like that these pizzas are very different than others in Phoenix....local pistachios on a pizza? Come on! Is it the best pizza in town? No...but it's definitely worth a try!

I interviewed many wedding planners prior to hiring S&T, and once I talked with Laurie and Kate I knew immediately they were a perfect match for us. Kate and Laurie are down to earth, fun to work with, and work around the clock to ensure your day is perfect and exactly what you envisioned. Without Kate's expertise, I would not have been able to find such an amazing vendor team.  She was always one step ahead of me in the planning process and organized everything from the budget, vendor payments, and precise timeline and itinerary on the day of the wedding. My family was able to enjoy the day (and year prior!) knowing that all the details were in good hands. The whole year and day of could not have run any smoother.

For .25 cents you get what you pay for you probably get half a shot per drink but after 3 or 4 of these suckers you should have a good buzz. There is a weird mix of people here you've got the cowboys, hoochies, thugs, Scottsdale brats, and some regular people here and there.

However, it seemed like after time, the responses were shorter and less thorough, to the point where sometimes I wouldn't get a response. I am very detail orientated and probably over-emailed on some subjects, but when you are planning your own wedding that does tend to happen...

The day of the wedding I was mostly busy getting ready, but as soon as the caters arrived I started receiving complains from my guests and wedding party about the attitude the caterers exhibited. I am not really sure where this is coming from, when they arrived there was even less work for them to do because I went ahead and had us set up all of the table arrangements... apparently there was a discrepancy about the placement of a table, where the coffee cups were, about a pregnant woman having some Hors d'Oeuvres before they were passed, about the home owner of the venue (my uncle) requesting a bottle of champagne for their table but being denied by  the bartenders..... ah, on and on and on. Cleanup was a huge rush, almost like they were rushing the guests to eat. 

My biggest irritation was when I spoke with the rental company I used a few weeks after the wedding. There was 14 missing napkins and a ton of missing silverware, all of which I have to pay for. It's not so much the cost of it, while the caterers were responsible for the cleanup I realize some of the guests may have ""thrown"" their silverware in the trash on accident.... but without any information from me or my guests, the owner of the company asked who I had the wedding catered by, because he could tell that ""whoever it was, did not take care of my items"". He was referring to the dishes, the glasses, the silverware, etc. Hearing that from someone in the business, without any prompts from outside sources, was extremely discouraging.  

On a positive note - the food was excellent. Perhaps if they just remind themselves why they are there at the event in the first place, that it's not just a chore or a J-O-B but an extremely essential part of a landmark for a couple, they can align their attitude with the quality of their food. If that were to happen, they would definitely deserve 5 stars.",0
trn_655,"We took our son to this ER for a simple stomach virus. They did such a thorough job that they found a tumor in his chest. The radiologist saw an enlarged thymus from the X-ray. If she had not done such an amazing job we may have found it too late. I will forever be thankful to the Doctors that did their job that day. We have a huge scar as a reminder but also a beautiful, sweet boy still with us.",1
trn_656,"I recommend everyone sees this show for the spectacular visuals that I will never forget.  However, I must admit to being a bit disappointed with my first Vegas Cirque show, having seen four previous shows in Los Angeles.  For every spectacular visually stunning number there were a few that were kind of boring, just many costumed people dancing around on the stage.  I wasn't sure to look to find the great acrobatics I was expected but often times there weren't any.  That's right...far less acrobatics than I've come to expect from smaller Cirque shows.  

Yes, there were two very good numbers in the middle of the show (one with unicycles flying) but that turned out to be the climax of thrills.  After that it was back to amazing visuals and a lot of wandering around onstage.  The attempt at a story was unfortunate.  Better to skip storytelling than attempt it so poorly.

If you like the Beatles, see this.  Everyone else can skip it.  Amazing visuals, great theatricality, but not much drama.",1

trn_658,"Well let me tell you about this place. My family gathered here tonight for my aunts birthday. 16 of us total, probably closed to a grand in total purchases. Two waitresses were rude to us all because we had the nerve to ask for a couple tables to be put together. Then, another waitress walked by and rolled her eyes because she had to walk around my Grandmother who was holding her great grandson. None of these ridiculous situations were worse than when the OWNER of the business came by and gave my 90 year old grandmother a completely unnecessary and impolite attitude. No man should speak to a woman the way this man spoke to my grandmother. We were told ""you've been here two hours, I have tables to turn, and you're holding people up."" ...we had just finished dinner. Literally just finished. The owner is rude and so is his staff. I've worked in customer service for many years and I can tell you that no service person should ever treat anyone the way these people treated us. I, and my family, will NEVER return to this establishment.",-1
trn_659,"Amazing flavors in their food!!  We had:

Calamari - lightly breaded, excellent flavor.
Tom Ka soup - perfectly prepare with generous portions of chicken and veggies
Lettuce Wraps - bold flavor with extremely fresh lettuce bowls
Spicy Eggplant with scallops - an instant favorite
Cucumber salad - good, but not great.  Dressing had too much sugar

Service was lightning fast!  We ordered online, then arrived 8 minutes later and they were just finishing up.",1
trn_660,"My husband and I usually go to Sweet Poke, but decided to switch it up and try this place.

I really love the paint splatter decor. It's very colorful. That's primarily the reason we were drawn to check this place out.

They build your order as you pick the meat and fillings that you want. Their tortillas are made from scratch and the ingredients were pretty fresh. The service was pretty quick and the staff was friendly. I ordered a steak quesadilla and my husband ordered the chicken nachos. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't spectacular either. I think of this as an overpriced Chipotle, as you can get similar items at Chipotle for less.

That being said, their horchata is deliciously amazing. I would come here just for that. Their drink fountain bar is pretty cool - they have the generic soda drinks, as well as Mexican drinks (horchata, tamarind) and fresh fruit juices - but you also have the option to customize your drinks by adding flavor shots.

I don't know that I'll be back for their food, but I will definitely come when I'm craving an horchata.",0
trn_661,This is the worst business in Las Vegas it's really sad that I'm refusing to order from here anymore because I refuse to deal with the manager Rasheed and it's extremely sad that his father leaves the business to him the way that he runs things this business will never get far they are a rip-off if they don't have your order correct they will not fix it and when they tell you they will fix it they never do I am now fighting them in court because my order was way off I spent $100 on a business order and now they're refusing to do anything about it not to mention I've been a customer over 2 years now and Rasheed has the nerve to treat me this way HE IS THE WORST MANAGER I HOPE IS FATHER PUTS HIS TRUST IN SOMEONE ELSE RASHEED IS DEFINITELY NOT FIT FOR THE JOB save your self the trouble don't order here,-1
trn_662,"This is by far my favorite dispensary. The staff mostly consists of women.(I am 21 female). the Bud-Tenders really know about the products tgey sell and always, help me decide the best strains to fit my needs. I'm always greated with smiles and cheer which is most wonderful because I suffer from a few mental health disorders. Within 10 minutes I am in and out; I am made to feel right at home. I would have rated 5 stars but once i bought a thing of chocolate for a buy one get one free deal but there was zero effect. I recommend their gummy bears though i never have had a problem.

Pros:
Fast service
By far freindly staff
Knowledgeable bud-tenders 
Strain of day and mega sales.
Clean and nice atmosphere

Cons:
One time editable problem.",1
trn_663,"Starting this review with three stars as I'm sitting at the table in the restaurant...let's see where this night will end up. 

First off, the only reason I start it with three is because I can see the potential. Cute patio to the left with cabana, string lights, and posh furnishing as you walk towards this randomly placed restaurant. Once you go through the doors, you walk into a cute waiting area with a black and white film playing against the walls. The hostess was on the phone as we entered so we thought we'd enjoy the time to just appreciate the decor. She hangs up, and then the phone rings again and she takes it. Doesn't bother us too much cause we were still fascinated by the casual elegance and continuing on with our conversation. Then she hangs up the phone once more and of course, the phone rings again and she picks it up. Okay now we're mad. HI, DID I FORGET TO TAKE MY INVISIBILITY CLOAK OFF IN THE CAR OR SOMETHING? So lucky us the manager was walking towards the stand and we knew we would soon be sat. NOOOPE. He was watching her talk on the phone and then looked down at the books while I was still standing there with no acknowledgement of me and my guest at all until I said the first hello. OH ALL OF A SUDDEN I APPEARED and he sat us. 

It took awhile for the server to come greet us and I was getting irritated to the point that I was ready to place the total tip on the table and slowly take each dollar away so they can visually see how much they are sucking! Sorry, but it was our anniversary dinner (which they were informed of) so I was really hoping for a special experience! This review has moved down to two stars at this point.  Anyway the server finally noticed us and took our order. My boyfriend ordered a glass of McCallan 18 neat and it took them 20 minutes to get it to him, AFTER I reminded the server at the 15 minute mark. I mean, come on, you literally just open the bottle and pour it in the glass. It takes 10 seconds, probably even less. So we're obviously VERY frustrated at this point. To add to this horrible experience, the server is standing in front of our table and starts making comments about killing some guy in the restaurant and bad mouthing him like crazy to another employee. ARE WE ON MYSTERY DINERS?? Cause this service just seems so dramatically terrible. 

Luckily this place offers some tasty looking entrees that are decently priced. We started with salads - the caesar ($10) and the house ($9.50). I know caesar salads are simple, but I absolutely loved it here! It was basically a wedge of romaine lettuce wrapped with prosciutto and stuffed with three long bread sticks. Simple but very delicious. For the main entree, I went with the veal and angel hair pasta dish ($32) and the boyfriend went with the honey glazed chicken ($22). Skip the veal and go for the chicken! 

During our meal, the server came by and apologized for his manner earlier and that he didn't mean for us to hear all his negative comments. Okay, that's nice, but that doesn't excuse anything honestly. It's not hard to keep your opinions to yourself or at least go into a back room to vent if needed. 

Back to 3 stars ONLY because I actually enjoyed the food. Overall I would possibly consider returning because the flatbreads looked worth trying, but I feel like I would really have to grit my teeth on making the effort because the service was extremely lacking...",0
trn_664,"At the table and I haven't even left yet. I've been coming here for years and decided to take a new friend to my favorite spot. She ordered the Manicotti and had one bite and didn't like it. We asked the waitress if we could trade it out for something else. The gentleman who I guess is a manager here said he ""can't replace the food simply because you don't like it, cause other customers like it so there is nothing I can do if you dont"" I always come here, the staff is wonderful and I never have any problems. And whenever we didn't like something they always replaced it. No problem, excellent service. I am so embarrassed that I talked her into going here tonight and will not be taking anymore friends here in the future.",-1
trn_665,"Went online and was pleasantly surprised that Denny's delivers. So, I placed my order, and it stated it would take 55 minutes. I only ordered chicken nuggets and a salad, but I figured the wait time was because they were busy. Over and hour went by and my food still wasn't delivered. I called and the girl that answered the phone told me that their Denny's didn't deliver. Okay, we'll, I had already paid and was charged a delivery fee, and gave a tip. The girl sounded disinterested, and had no customer service skills whatsoever, not to mention had somewhat of an attitude. I asked if they received delivery notifications, even though they don't personally deliver, and she said yes. So instead of calling me once my order came in to notify me, I guess I was suppose to eventually wonder where my food was and why I was being charged for a service they don't have. She put me on hold, so she could get the manager, and I waited close to 10 minutes before handing up. I tried to call Denny's back over 10 times in a 20 minute period, and it kept ringing and ringing with no answer. I got so frustrated that I had my husband call on his phone, and the same girl picked up on the second ring! My call was being screened, because she didn't know how to resolve my problem. I was livid. My husband talked to the manager who finally after hours  since my order was put in, refunded me my money. I will never give this location any business. That girl needs to really be re-evaluated for her position there, and/or trained in customer service.",-1
trn_666,"I was at the Las Vegas McCarren Airport walking around to kill some time before my flight and stumbled across this gem. I would describe it as an upscale sports bar. Great atmosphere, great food and great service. I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Daryn, one of the coolest bartenders. I ordered a double whiskey neat along with the Poppin' Dog. A Poppin' Dog is a foot long Kobe hotdog with bacon, pico de gallo and queso sauce. Check the pic...best hotdog I've had hands down. It also comes with chili cheese fries. Best part is they have a bunch of TV's so I was able to catch the beginning of the Knights game while I ate. Overall, Daryn and the other staff that assisted me were friendly and personable, the food was delicious and the price was totally reasonable. Exactly what I was looking for before my flight back home!",1

trn_670,"I wish I could list all the things I love about metro but I don't think anyone would actually sit and read a review for hours. We've been coming here since 2002, we've been to all locations, and we have never had a bad meal or bad service. When family comes into town from San Diego, they usually meet us here...as in they don't even want to come to our house to drop their luggage off. Lately, this has us wondering, are they here to see us or are they here for the Metro Pizza?? They demand we eat here at least 2x per visit. Just the other day, my husband used the Pasta Pie (a must try) as a fantasy football trade incentive. The pizza is that powerful. The latest pizza we ordered--with the always perfect, thick metro crust, had to be the best ever. The crust was so perfect; thick but airy, crisp yet soft. After a decade of enjoying this pizza, you don't think it can actually get better. But it does. Each pizza is a masterpiece...and that's exactly how they treat it.",1

Get the fish tacos and shrimp tacos. You won't regret it.",1
trn_672,"This place has a lot of things going for it that make it a solid venue - plenty of space, easy to get to using public transit, & helpful yet not hovering staff who don't mind if you loiter all evening long just as long as you're buying.

Food and drinks are average price and quality, but do the trick. There's nothing groundbreaking or ""must-have"" about Scallywags, but it's a comfy and welcoming environment (doesn't seem as dank as other nearby pubs) and it's especially great for groups. 

I can't speak for the times when it might be bustling with sports fans (there's quite a few screens about to watch games of various persuasions), but on a general week-night it's a great option for getting together.",0

They gave us a free taco to try because it was our first time. They have buy one get one free pastor tacos on Wednesday's. They only down side for me is they could have one salsa that is actually spicy. The salsa are good but not too spicy, I like a little heat with my tacos ;-)

trn_676,"Service is friendly and the baked goods and pastries look so good on display but take a bite and everything tastes so bad I had to throw them out (all 6!) Everything takes so synthetic and there is no way that is real whip cream in their pastries. The black sesame cheesecake is just vile had to spit it out. The matcha cream puff is not even the right choux pastry texture. The caramalized sugar croissant was like some weird bastardized version of the classic, texture and taste was just so off and weird. Prices match top quality French patisseries but the cheap chemical-like ingredients are worse than the cheapest Chinatown bake shop.",-1
trn_677,"Omar and his staff did a great job on my Ford Focus. The window tinting job was a gift from my dad, who's actually the one that decided to bring it to Omar's. Initially, he wanted to go there because they give military discount. However, I'm glad it's where we went because, like I said, they did a great job and I'm very happy with how it looks. Omar was very informative about the different tints they do, as well as letting us know which grade is considered illegal for the front windows. (I told him I definitely wanted to stay legal. My car is bright red, and I don't need to draw more attention from the police to pull me over haha).
Last but not least, it comes with a full lifetime warranty! I would recommend Omar's to anyone needing window tinting (auto, home, etc.)",1

Then it was a host of different repairs he could do. The tech showed me pictures that he supposedly took of my unit in the attic. I'm not sure who's unit it was.

trn_680,"Where to begin...
Beerbistro deserves its high rating - food, service and beer selection are all excellent. My night tho, did not end so well, mostly because of this and add in good company.

First, the food and drinks:
- belgian frites
Top choice, great flavour and texture
- new england style mussels
Small mussels but good
- wagyu tacos
Loaded with meat, but it's ground
- pulled pork pizza
My friend's fave, tasty bbq sauce
- steak frites
Excellently cooked and seasoned medium
- 3 Lindeman Apple
- 3 different stouts

I made reservations for a Tuesday night which I highly recommend. Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable. The bar and dining area are separated, but still open and you can see into the kitchen. The space is stylish and comfortable at the same time. We could've stayed there a lot longer since we were never rushed with our seating or food.
It's a bit pricey so -0.5 star for me.

So how did my night not end so well you say?
It was just my friend visiting from NY and myself dining, so we ordered wa-haaay too much food. I am also a beginner beer drinker,  a fruity Lindeman Apple was the obvious choice (and it was very good). But I guess 3 beers and stuffing our face with all this food pretty much had me rushing to the women's washroom for a ""Technicolour Yawn"" (I had to google a nice way to say 'puke' - sorry, TMI).

In the end, my friend and I had a great time! I'm glad to lose my beer-ginity at Beerbistro. The very first (2-day) hangover wasn't so much fun... Amateur - I know!",1
trn_681,"Very disappointing for a more upscale Mexican restaurant.  It's located in park road shopping center.  There is plenty of parking available.  Chips and salsa were tasty however, the queso dip was a disappointment.  How do you mess up melted cheese.  There was absolutely nothing great about the food.  It was so disappointing I can't even remember which kind of tacos I ordered.  The rice was inedible.  

It is a large restaurant with plenty of outdoor seating on the front patio.  A great view of the parking lot ;) 

I will not be returning to this restaurant.  There's tons of Mexican restaurants to choose from in Charlotte and this one does not make the cut.",0
trn_682,"Only ever been here for dance parties, which have ranged from awesome to awful. They do have good nights here, with great music some of the time, and an OK crowd.

BUT the downstairs of this place is brutal. First of all it's carpeted, which is just gross for any place where alcohol is spilled on a regular basis. In the summer time, it is literally a sauna of sweat, even if there aren't that many people there. In the winter, your feet will be covered in mud and slush, brought in from the outside and turned into a slippery mess on the carpet. 

If you can, stay upstairs and stay clean, dry, and keep drinking. Speaking of drinks, they have lots of beers on tap, and cheap bottles. Overall, it's a fun night out depending on what's happening.",0

The maids accused me of keeping them an extra half hour over when they were 20 minutes late. The cleaning they provided was mediocre. They left particulates everywhere in my bathroom even after I asked them to look at it again. I will attach pictures which include dust bunnies visible from the center of the room, dirty toilets, and a dirty counter left for me to clean.

trn_692,"I've heard great things about this restaurants fish sandwich so I came here on a Friday around 6:00 during Lent with my husband. There was not a parking space anywhere, we actually had to drive around behind the building and park in a tight spot next to a dumpster. Walked in the door and we weren't even greeted, the hostess didn't ask how many were in our party or tell us how long of a wait it would be or say two words to us. I couldn't tell you what the fish tastes like because we turned around and walked out after 15 minutes of standing in the entrance next to the ""please wait to be seated"" sign while at least 3 staff members walked past us. I understand we came at a busy time but they could have at least acknowledge someone waiting to be seated.

Our waiter, Mike, was extremely attentive and professional. A woman, I'm guessing the Manager was perfunctory at best when she came over to check in and she was sure to let me know they were freshly made today. In other words a bit defensive. I have eaten crab cakes and made them hundreds of times, never smelled and tasted fishy like this. I really did not want to say anything since I rarely ever do, however, it was a bit obvious that I could not get past the first few bites. I suppose that since it was made today I should like them according to the manager. Anyway, Mike our waiter was 100% engaging, professional and attentive.",0

The restaurant crammed as many 2-tops as possible very close to one another violating any possible privacy. 

Service was nothing but transactional, think diner style. We felt rushed towards the end. With two dinners, a few glasses of wine, and a 20% tip the bill was north of $270 for a couple, and based on the quality of food (not bad, but nothing to write home about), mediocre service, I don't think this place is worth ever going back to.",-1

I brought my car for an alignment and after Roberto, the owner, took a look at it, he discovered the problem was with my front tire. No alignment was needed and I saved a lot of money. Roberto was very upfront and after replacing the bad tire at the tire store, the car rides good as new. 
It is nice to know an honest mechanic and repair shop still exists. I will be going to Delta Auto Care for all my future repair work. Roberto recently became the owner of this family  business and I see nothing but success ahead. Thank you Roberto for your excellent service today!",1

trn_701,"I was at Oishii Sushi for the first time on Saturday. 
We were a big group and given that the restaurant was packed - the service was actually very good. 
I am from Vancouver and know my sushi so I am a harsh critic when it comes to fresh, inventive, well presented and value driven sushi.  I would say that I have had sushi only twice in Calgary and this is the only place that I thought was ok. I don't expect it to be as reasonable as in Vancouver but I do expect good quality. Typically as a rule I don't eat the sushi unless I can see the ocean - but this place was pretty good. We did the All You Can Eat menu - which we typically also don't do but given the price here in Alberta and that there were so many in our group. It seems like a good option for value.  I didn't try the sashimi but most everything else was good.  Although I typically I don't tempura - the tempura here was amazing - super light and not greasy.",0

trn_703,"Ever since Silvertips suddenly closed, I've been trying to find a new place in my area to get the occasional mani/pedi.  I don't get my toenails or fingernails done regularly - it's just a once-in-awhile treat, so when I do indulge, I want the experience to be the best it can be.  After reading on BlogTO that Urban Nails was one of the top nail salons in the city, I knew it would be my next stop for my next indulgence.

Knowing that it came well-reviewed, I planned my morning around arriving as soon as the shop opened (in this case, 11:00AM as it was a Sunday).

I rolled into the store at 10:59AM, expecting to be first in line for nail services.  The place was packed!  The first thing I thought was maybe they were serving a private bridal party who had made special arrangements for the store to open early for pre-wedding mani/pedis.  After taking in the hustle and bustle that was happening before my eyes I realized it was actually just THAT busy despite the store technically not being open yet for another minute.  Did I miss a ""we're opening early today"" memo?  Talk about unwanted surprises.

Thankfully, there was a single pedicure open, so I was seated quickly, and my pedicure was done almost just as fast.  My nails looked nice and the polish lasted an awfully long time, but I never felt relaxed or at ease because the place was so busy!  Clearly, the faster they finish with me, the faster they can get the next butt in the chair.  I get it.  I also hate it when a nail salon sends their customers the drying room/wall/corner/abyss and then forget that they even exist.  I never suffer from abandonment issues until I am sitting alone with my toes under a dryer for 20 minutes, hoping someone will come make sure I'm good leave without the worry of ruining my nails!

The price was ok.  $34 after tip for my pedicure.  I honestly think I could either a) spend more elsewhere for a more relaxed and leisurely pedicure experience, or b) spend less for the same level of rushed and frantic service elsewhere.  I guess my hunt for a new nail place continues.",0
trn_704,"Unfortunately, I have to take the time to write this review.  I just got off of a phone call with the GM Chris from the Mesa and Dobson location.  We are a family of 5, Mom, Dad and three small children.  We received coupons in the mail to try this pizza and the first time, it was very good.  We ordered the Godfather which was recommended and turned out great.  So last night we tried it again and to our dismay was beyond disappointed!!!!  It had a horrible after taste as if the red chilli peppers, parmesan or the giardinera were rotten, moldy or had just gone bad in some way!  We called immediately to make them aware of the situation and they came back with an offer of an eleven dollar credit after we spent close to $40 and almost $60 the first time vs. taking responsibility of what happened.  The manager Kevin promised we would receive a call back today from his GM Chris, which never happened.. We had to call back tonight to explain what happened to speak to the GM Chris and again unfortunately we were treated the exact same way as last night!  On top of that Chris said, I apologize you didn't get a call back, I told my am manager to call you and he never did.  Also dismissing any responsibility and almost denying what happened to us and trying to say this never happened before or could ever happen.  It's not about the credit it's about the responsibility and we would Never want this to happen to Anyone else!!  Today no one in our family felt right after last night's pizza dinner.",-1
trn_705,"Absolutely one of the two most authentic Pakistani / East Indian Restaurants in Calgary. Their Boti's are to die for and they make a fabulous Nihari.  If you are looking for real Brown Man's food this is it.

Oh No now I'm feeling like making a trip down there.",1
trn_706,"Little place located inside Market Village. Like other yelpers mentioned this place specializes in tofu fa. It's made fresh and velvety smooth. I love the texture (soft and smooth) and fresh taste. Tofu fa can be served hot or cold; by itself or with other toppings. 
I also ordered take out container of tofu fa and fresh soy milk. Soy milk tastes fresh but a bit on the sweet side.",1
trn_707,"My husband and I had a Groupon for 50 minute massages. We used them today and then spent the day using the facilities and hanging out by the pool. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall the spa was very clean! Petra gave me a great massage! And our waitress by the pool was on point! The drinks and food were also very good! The menu is extensive. But it does take some time to receive the food. Our only complaints were the guests at the pool. If you want to party, drink and be loud, you really should hang out at the hotel pool. This is a spa pool, you know, to relax!! And the only other thing was, there wasn't any lotion in the bathrooms. They had everything else but lotion. I'm sure we could have asked, but after a full day and a hot shower, we were wet noodles!!
We will definitely be back!!",1
trn_708,"had lunch at the bahn mi bistro down the block and thought I would stick my head in here and check out the brisket. i fully expected to be disappointed when I ordered just 1/4 pound of fatty brisket, sliced. the gentleman went back and grabbed the meat from a warming box, and hand sliced me a 1/4 pound, putting it in a cool little box. $5.91 and out the door. in the car, my wife opened the box, and with her dainty fingers pulled a piece from within, put it in her cute little mouth, and moaned with delight. I tore off a piece and chucked it down. talk about good, it was beefy, smoky, tender and juicy.  all the things good BBQ should be. we will be back.",1
trn_709,"Good. I've been to every barriques in town. I love their decor and atmosphere. Their serving of alcohol gives them a more rustic(?) vibe. 

I don't think their coffee or lattes stand out though and their service isn't as friendly as Colectivo or other coffee shops I tend to go to so I only go to Barriques locations if it's more convenient Han going somewhere else.

I also wish they served a non dairy milk on their counter; I think that's quite the norm these days.",0
trn_710,"Metro has happy hour between 2:30-4:30 Tues-Thurs all pizzas are half off during this time. It was a rare occasion that I happened to have a Tuesday off, so some friends and I decided to have lunch here. We ordered a large salad and a large pizza, half Honolulu and half Sunspot. They also brought warm bread and butter to the table. It was more than enough food for 3 people. The pizza was good, but sadly it was a little watery and soggy. The Honolulu comes with ham, pineapple, bacon and green pepper, and the Sunspot had chicken, artichoke, tomatoes, basil and garlic. You would think with alllll of those toppings that they would have made the pizza a little bit more well done. Nothing is more unappetizing than a pizza that is watery. I enjoyed the pizza, but it's not the best I have ever had, and the only time I would probably come back here is for happy hour.",0
trn_711,"This place will always have a place in my stoma....errr...heart.  I have been coming here since high school, and I had graduated in '05 (woot!).  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping center.

I like Musashi as it's small and intimate in there.  They have booths, tables, a small bar, but what I really like is to sit in their room.  It looks like you'd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor, but there is openings for you to hang your feet.  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the room!

I prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck.  When you go in during lunch, make sure to look towards your right and you'll see A, B, C lunch options.  Those options aren't on the menu and change daily.  

My favorite thing to get here is the Ton-Kat-Su.  Man on man!  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life, this would be it.  It never disappoints!  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing!  If you think you can't get more salad dressing...YOU CAN!  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my heart's delight!

The staff here is really nice and you'll always see the same familiar faces when coming in.  Come check them out!  I promise you'll enjoy their food!",1
trn_712,"Super disappointed with myself for only coming here on the last day of our trip because Eggslut is amaaaazing!!!! 

I got the Fairfax ($8) - scrambled eggs, chives, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sriracha mayo on a brioche bun and added bacon ($3)! Suppppppper good.. probably the best egg sandwich I've ever had. 

Again, I really wish I would have tried this place earlier in my trip so I could have gone again - definitely a must try!",1
trn_713,Cutest place to come grab shaved ice cream or a slushy! I live right down the street from it and never been so I'm so happy I finally was able to try it! They have games and a hammock on their back patio and you would have never known. This is a little hidden gem! Thanks again!,1
trn_714,"The food:
If you're going here, you might as well splurge like you already are. Order the Ishi Yaki - it's at least $150 worth of Wagyu beef that you'll season and toss on your own hot-stone, leaving it to cook to your liking. You may also offend your neighbors: they'll envy your plate, but they may also not like how the smoke is incidentally wafted in their direction by the vents. 

The wild Mushroom Toban-Yaki is on the salty side. The Tiger Shrimp Tempura is more than enough for 2 people despite being labeled as a small plate - loved it. I didn't like the Lobster Taquitos because of the lemongrass and ginger. The Watermelon Mojo beverage had too much mint for my liking. I'll be back to try out other dishes!

The service:
I'm also not typically a fan of Asian cuisine, but I definitely enjoyed most of everything else that was ordered. I appreciate the waiter serving my table for making recommendations (and yes, up-selling). They definitely came by to check on us very often.

Lucky side note: 
I think I've decided on going to SushiSamba during their slow times: right after the holidays and before New Years Eve. It sounds like this place is less hectic during this time frame. Even so, I managed to have a piece of plastic flung my direction during dinner. I thought I had been drinking too much, or a part of the restaurant's decor had started to deteriorate but nope - it was a patron's credit card that somehow flew out of one's hand and landed behind my seat cushion and the wall lighting/backrest. They nearly had the whole place turned upside down trying to find the thing. My date and I should have taken this luck to go gambling afterwards.",1
trn_715,"This place was really wonderful. Ate here for the first time today and will definitely be back. I had the Cuban with sweet potato fries and a salad (THAT SALAD) and couldn't even finish I was so full. My friend got the Kaya burger and it was HUGE! It looked delicious and I will definitely be trying that the next time I go back.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere and everyone I talked to was very friendly. I wish I had caught the name of our waitress today because she was awesome! (Waitress, we talked about my scarf from Thailand. You were great!)",1
trn_716,"This place is huge, we spent at least a couple hours there. They have something for everyone and everyone that worked there was so helpful and they felt like old friends.",1
trn_717,My daughter loves finding small coffee places wherever we go and this one was a lovely find. We loved the decor and the general atmosphere. I didn't get coffee myself but my daughters Cuban coffee wasn't good. The sugar wasn't dissolved and all sat at the bottom of the cup. Disappointing. But I loved my breakfast. I got the tacos and really loved them.,1
trn_718,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Oh, and did I mention terrible?

I landed at McCarren on a Tuesday evening and got to the rental car center at 9:30 PM with an Advantage reservation in hand: 4 days for about $80 all told, including taxes.

Not only was there a line of about fifteen people waiting to get to the counter (I stood in this line for nearly an hour), there was only one person working the desk for most of that time. When I FINALLY got to speak to someone, I was told that simply because I was paying using a debit card instead of a credit card (I don't have/carry a credit card), I would be subjected to both a credit check AND my card would be CHARGED--not authorized, CHARGED--$350. This policy was not displayed anywhere on the website that I saw, nor was I notified in advance.

Long story short--I waited in line for no reason and walked away without a car. On the bright side, at least my taxi ride to my hotel was half of what the online calculators had estimated.",-1

trn_721,"Shame on me for going to this guy three times since he lives so close to me but I had enough. I think he overcharges too much and I really don't think he is all that friendly.
 
He didn't repair my shoes the first time completely as my zipper kept unlocking again and I returned it the second time to tell him that and he wanted me to pay more so I just returned the shoes, wasted money AND he didn't call like he said.  

The second time I brought my bag and he actually fixed it and that was pretty good but it was still a bit overpriced to my liking. Not only that, he forgot to call me again  so I had to go back there myself to check if it was okay.

The third time I wanted to get another bag fixed and he forgot to call me (although I know it is my responsibility as well but I wanted to see if he actually would call but he didn't just like the first two times) so I left my bag there and just forgot about it. NEVER going here again...EVER.

UPDATE 1.18.2012
I HATE THIS GUY! Never have I hated any business owner but he takes the cake. So mind you, my bag that I left since September was still there. He called me and asked if I was picking it up or he would donate it but I told him I'd get it anyway. This guy had the nerve to charge my brother $20 which I had rightfully already paid. If I had this bag since September because my ass didn't call, I would give it to my customer for FREE because that's customer service which he obviously lacks. Even my brother within the first few seconds could tell he was obnoxious. I would NEVER recommend him. I am beyond furious!",-1
trn_722,It seems like highway robbery to buy 4 pieces of pizza and two drinks for 17+ dollars throw in the tip and it amounts to 20. So I got a half a pizza for more than most places sell a whole.,1
trn_723,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
It's such a bang for a buck!

It has options for vegetarians too.
The tater tots are so good, with literally a million sauces to choose from, and its no charge unless youre adding actually toppings to your tots. (Same with the fries). Tots and fries are $3, with $1 for extra toppings.
The veggie dog is so good...some say it's even better than the normal dogs but I wouldn't know because I haven't tried the real hot dogs. I promise you though, you will not regret giving happy dog a chance!!! The hotdogs/veggie dog is $6. 
(Just a personal favorite, GET THE EGG. its a weird combination, but its so good!!) 

There is a bar and its dimly lit but there is a back section where is a little bit brighter with more tables to sit at.

Definitely check this place out :) It's my fave and everyone seems to love this place.",1
trn_724,Gotta get your bagel double steamed. Trust me. If the pimento cheese grits are still a special they are a must.,1
trn_725,"Nothing beats something warm and hearty on a cold winter's day. The staff are really friendly and service is prompt. I tried their Curried lamb wrap and Ravi stew on one occasion and on another their porcini mushroom wild rice bisque and their Flank Steak Wrap. 

From the recommendation of the cashier, I got the Ravi stew which had a nice kick to it from black pepper. The Ravi Stew was hearty with various vegetables and chunks of meat. The Curried lamb wrap was really flavourful, it had a good amount of both vegetables and meat.

Their mushroom wild rice bisque was no joke, it was filled with mushroom and had a nice peppery taste to it. It was so hearty and paired with their Flank Steak Wrap, it made such a winning comfort food combination. The Flank Steak Wrap is usually good but when there's the perfect amount of sauce and wrapped so it doesn't fall apart, it's amazing! There's something savoury about having a wrap with sweet potatoes which gives the otherwise regular wrap a unique twist.

I highly recommend getting the combo since it's a great deal.",1
trn_726,"I never have been particularly fond of Indian food.  That is due to my tradition American childhood of basically pizza and fast food.  I could never get use to the Aromatic spices that Indian food is so known for.  However, I noticed the great reviews and photos while on business in the Cleveland area and decided to give this nontradition approach to the cuisine a try.  WOW! I must say a hugh thank you to the owners and staff for reintroducing me to their version of Indian ""fast causal"" cuisine.  From the outstanding decor, the quick order process, easily understood menu, helpful staff, quick service and last but not least amazing food I personnely have a new found cuisine to enjoy and explore further.  The BBQ lamb meal was very tastey and the basmati rice cooked perfectly.  The freshly baked naan brought the meal together.  I will make this establishment a frequent stop, business or pleasure.",1

trn_728,After seeing this place so many times figured we would finally try it out. The service was good food was not worth the money at all. The chicken has little to no flavour and the portion size was very very small for the price. I could barely find the teaspoon scoop of guacamole on it. We ended up having to go out for more food after (and we don't have huge appetites).Toronto has much better Mexican fast food locations.,-1
trn_729,"The food is always good- which is why I come back. My burger was over cooked and it still tasted fine. However the service is never fantastic, today exemplified that.

It came out a few minutes later, piping hot and delicious.  You get a free cheese bomb with Yelp check in but they weren't offering them that day.  I will have to save it for next time.  Make sure to get the honey drizzle.  It adds just the right amount of sweetness.",1
trn_734,"I love Encanto Park. I initially came here because I live so close, but there are a bunch of reasons why I come back. First of all, it's beautiful. There's a little lake and water system that runs through the park with a few walking bridges that add a nice touch. There are tons of walking trails and ducks/birds/swans/turtles to look at. My boyfriend has hit golf balls there a few times and really enjoys the facility. There may be a hobo lurking here and there, but that's what you get almost anywhere in downtown Phoenix. There's a children's amusement park that I have yet to go to, but I'll amend my post once I've gone.

Overall, this park is perfect for an afternoon stroll, a book in the shade, or place to hit a few balls.",1

trn_736,"Coming from the dining mecca of Chicago, IL, my friends and I had high expectations for our first Melt experience. We were attending a wedding at the Embassy Suites down the block, so Melt was naturally our best choice for a noon lunch. We were not disappointed! 

The decor here is so cool! I realize it's a chain, but other chains could take Melt's example and go nuts with their bar like Melt does. Constantly rotating beer, sandwich, and food specials are posted on chalkboards and the place is fun just to walk around and look at the tacky, hilarious decorations. Loved the touch of record album menus! 

Service was great. The place was packed, but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. Our beautifully tattooed bartender was attentive, efficient, sweet, and cute! She let us sample many different beers before arriving at our final order. Also, she changed the t.v's to the Bears game, so props! Our food came just in time - not too soon or too late. We were in a bit of a rush, but didn't want to be forced out. 

Finally, and most importantly, the food was the bomb dot com! I had the War Pig (Caribbean jerk pork belly, mango habenero salsa, plantains, slaw), my friend had the Parmageddon (one of us had to as we're Ukrainian and love pierogis), and my other friend had the Wake & Bake. After sampling all of them, there was just joy and full bellies. The ratio of ingredients was perfect and the chefs have such originality! Melt definitely blows their Chicago counterpart Cheesie's out of the water! The portion sizes at Melt are out of this world, and to think that my friend wanted to order an appetizer! The other half of my War Pig was still just as tasty at 4 a.m. following a plethora of Fireball shots at the wedding. If I'm ever in the vicinity of greater Cleveland, I will surely be back!",1
trn_737,"I had an appointment for 1:20pm today and came in at 1:10. I was dressed rather poorly as this was my one and only errand on my day off. I sat down at the appointment desk but I wasn't acknowledged at any point. It was at 1:40 that I finally got the nerve to see why I hadn't even been addressed yet. In the span of about 30 minutes I watched as several customers who came in after me (and better dressed than me) had their problems fixed while I continued to wait patiently. My friend who came with me (who was dressed nice) was approached about a possible appointment minutes after setting foot in the door. He said no and the employee admitted that his fellow colleagues will completely ignore customers at times. When I finally asked why I hadn't been helped the employee said they had canceled my appointment. (Why, I am not sure) He then went on to say that next time I should speak up if I didn't want the same thing to happen again. Almost as if the problem was my fault. In my opinion the issue could've been solved with some better customer service. Now I do not know why it took them so long to acknowledge me but from this review it may sound to you like I was discriminated because of the way I was dressed, but who knows for sure. I only wanted to state the facts. I seldom like to leave bad reviews or start arguments, but I felt very disrespected. And after talking about with my friend who came along, they agreed. The only reason I don't give the store a 1 star is because when I was finally helped the employee was kind and quick. My problem was solved without any payments necessary. I believe the employee's name was Orelle (?)",-1

trn_741,"Rock of Ages is like watching fireworks made of diamonds, jizz and Aqua Net explode in the night sky, while a choir of leather-clad angels pour sunshine joygasms into your ears, and the naked Thunderbirds fly by overhead, trailing clouds of cocaine and pure cane sugar. IT'S THAT GOOD!

Every single thing about it is fantastic and well-executed. The costumes are hilarious, the staging is fantastic, the music will rock your sox off (even if you don't like 80s metal, you'll recognize almost every song), the band is amazing, the theater is cleverly decorated with vintage signage (hello, Budweiser ladies!) and the cast goes BALLS-OUT the entire way.

Even the book is fan-fuckin-tastic -- usually with these ""jukebox musicals,"" the plot is paper-thin and basically just an excuse to string together a bunch of old songs. But Rock of Ages actually manages to make SENSE, and even to be genuinely witty along the way. And this is coming from someone who despises Broadway musicals and Vegas shows in general.

Kudos to the writers, set designers and costumers...but the real accolades go to the cast, which is astonishingly fantastic (and trust me, I DETEST showbiz people). In particular, special shout-outs must go to narrator/comic relief character Lonny (the indescribably fabulous and hilarious Mark Shunock); evil German developer Hertz (the fabulous Robert Torti); his son Franz (wacky Kevin Hegmann); and club owner Dennis (a sort of Jeff-Bridges-as-the-dude-y Troy Burgess).  

But top kudos must go to the beautiful monstrous freak who plays badass rocker Stacee Jacks. I know they say Tom Cruise did a great job playing this character in the movie (which I haven't seen)...but I honestly can't imagine ANYONE doing this better than Kyle Lowder, who sort of looks like a Barbie doll on steroids and is just side-splittingly/mouth-gapingly/unbelievably AMAZING in this role. 

I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed this fantastic, bombastic spectacle! Such a relief to see a show that doesn't take itself too seriously -- this shit is tongue-in-cheek, all the way. It WALLOWS in gratuitous cheese. RUN, don't walk -- and check this show out before they replace it with some more Cirque du Bullshit!!!",1

trn_762,I am so disappointed in this place as I have been there many MANY times and every single time i need a refill of something as silly as my clyndomyacin pledgets they try and force me to go in. They are greedy and Only look out to line their own pockets. Dr. Tran has seen me enough times to know that I need those pads and can't just give me a regular refill. He wants the insurance money. The receptionist went to ask him again and AGAIN he said no. It's not like I'm asking for drugs over here I'm asking for pledgets (medicated pads) for my face that have worked fabulous for me for a year now.. if I don't have them I get acne..I told them I would make an appointment with them right away at that moment I just needed the pads tonight before bed and again a no.. it's unbelievable the greed and I am so incredibly disappointed and will NEVER go back to this place. My recommendation for someone looking for a dermatologist who cares and isn't greedy? Go somewhere else.,-1
trn_763,"Love this place, it's not just pinball, there are all kinds of other arcade games too for kids. All games are playable and there are plenty of coin change machines, so just bring lots cash, and a container to keep all the change in if you don't like them jingling around your pockets. The pinball machines are usually 50c for 3 balls, but don't underestimate how quickly those drain away. Some machines are 75c for 5 balls, which I prefer. There are some pretty fancy ones for $1.00 for 3-5 balls.

It's just one guy tending to all these machines so don't expect perfection. There are no fancy casino style attendants or drinks ladies. There are some attendants sweeping the floor or keeping the place clean but they are volunteers. Some machines are not very well calibrated. If you lose your money to a machine, or there was a malfunction, or a ball is stuck... just walk away and try another one. And yes there WILL be times when a machine eats your money, or the flippers don't work well... I don't like to argue for a couple of quarters. Did I mention all the money is donated to the Salvation Army? Yes, this pinball arcade donates hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity so just have fun and don't kick a fuss.

A great way to kill a few hours for cheap.",1

trn_767,"Integrity is defined as ""The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness."" Used in a sentence: Rich is gentleman of complete integrity. Rich is my plumber for life and I only met him 24 hours ago.

For over 12 hours Rich with American Plumbing and Rooter stood by my side (me in NYC) and my tenants' side (them in Phoenix) during one of the most trying times I've ever had as a homeowner and landlord.

Last July I used another plumber to rectify roots in my sewer line. The issue resumed and I contacted the same plumbing company used last time but received a new rep. He found a significant root issue at the ""tap"" of my line and said he'd need to go through my concrete driveway with an estimate for the job at $4,000. I hadn't connected as well with this new rep as I had with the prior rep and having to start all over with a new guy was daunting. I decided to reach out to other plumbers who specialized in sewer repair for a second opinion on Monday morning. I was delighted when:

MONDAY - 9AM ET
Rich answered the phone and explained his approach to my sewer line issue including potential costs. It worth noting he never once took the opportunity to dismantle the reputation of the other plumbing company. He went to the property that afternoon even though he was booked-out thru Wednesday since my tenants had not been able to use water since Saturday. 

12PM ET
Rich calls me while he was able to clear the line (without going thru the driveway) he went further out and at 60 feet (the street) he discovered a significant issue; water hiding the line which he could not push thru. He explained that it could either be my line or the city's main line, and since it was under the street it would be a very big job.

Rich guided me thru the entire process of how I would need to find out who would be responsible for the repair--me as homeowner or the city. He instructed I call Precision Location Services--he even calls them to tell them the situation is urgent--so that they can take a video which I will need to further diagnose the issue as well as use to prove it is the city's responsibility. He lets me know what fee to expect from Precision Location Services and that he trusts them implicitly. He also suggests that I contact the city sewer department to get the ball rolling. I contact the city and they send out a foreman immediately.

12:30 PM ET:
My tenant calls me and says the city went there to inspect, and they requested I get a plumber and video guy out as they discover the line is under water when they open the manholes. Precision Locations Services gets their guy out to the home within 30 minutes.

1:00PM ET.
Precision Location Services and City of Phoenix Utilities Supervisor are at the home and city says they need a plumber by law. I call Rich who is on another job and he drops everything to go to my home. 

5:00 PM ET
Rich calls me onsite with an update: There is a huge blockage that cannot be determined if it is my line or the city's. I can hear Rich speaking with the City's Utilities Supervisor and my tenant as if they were brothers - he's representing me in the best light possible and I've known him for 8 hours. My financial livelihood depends on the city picking up this huge tab and my tenant's well- being and happiness! The result: The city deems it is their responsibility to rectify and my tenant sends me the following text: ""You have a big heart. I hope you are blessed for your help. Thank you again for everything."" 

7:40PM ET - 10:30PM
Tenant updates: ""There are 8 men, 5 trucks, a backhoe."" ""They finally got to the main pipe, it was 6 feet 5"" down. They are cleaning the hole before opening the pipe to see what it is."" ""They had to get a vacuum to pull out the roots. Years of growth, very tight and 20"" deep into pipe almost a solid plug. They used Sawzall to break it up to pull it out.""

Rich made himself available to me last evening up until 10:30 my time.  He assures me the city is taking care of it and that it is either severe root issue or collapsed line but not to worry as it is finally being rectified. It is clear to Rich at 10:30PM ET that I am overwhelmed and exhausted. He texts: ""Yes, it is a lot for anyone to handle. You stayed cool, this is a BIG DEAL and I'm happy you called us to go out : )""

TUESDAY 9AM ET:
Rich is gentleman of complete integrity from which I benefitted from in the following ways:
* Tenants have water and are happy with me.
* Rich complied and worked with the city's Utilities Supervisor in a respectful and timely manner which I believe contributed to the favorable outcome for me as homeowner.

Another reviewer said: ""With his wonderful customer service skills, professionalism, knowledge, accuracy, listening skills, friendly personality, attention to details and prompt service Rich was able to transform a chaotic, confusing and totally unexpected experience into a pleasant one.""

Yu Shiang Scallops are not bad, pan fried dumplings are dark brown on only one side, the other two sides are mushy, Moo Shu Pork was pretty good but it only included 3 pancakes and it had none of the greens and veggies I expect with it, the fried rice is ok but far from the best (even for take out) Hunan Pork is ok but bland, nothing is spicy in spite of what the menu claims and everything shares a sameness. to it's taste.

There was a guy (who I assume was the manager? Assistant manager?) with slicked blonde hair, wearing dress pants and a dress shirt and looked and sounded like a total douchebag. He constantly stared at customers and looked miserable. The store looks like a miserable mess and smelled awful. Go across the street to the newly opened Common Sort.

Since their departure we have been handled by one guy who is constantly running in circles (the place is never over 40% capacity when we arrive) mixing up drink orders and has no concept that it is a lunch HOUR not a lunch afternoon.  He's a nice guy but he is clearly not cut out to handle dining service.  Additionally, although I understand that there is no uniform and a girl has to make a living, I have grown tired of watching the female bartenders walking back and forth with half their backsides showing.   Today the girl's shorts were so small and tight, literally half her cheeks were hanging out.  I thought it was Libretto's, not Hooters, that we were going to for our meal.

When technician finally came out she suggested me to do procedure anyway even though she would not see anything. I just don't understand why. Absolutely terrible experience. When you come late 30 min they can't accept you but it's ok if you wait wanting to go to the bathroom really bad. For procedure like this it's not ok to make person wait that long.

trn_781,"I've been to the one in San Francisco. It came highly recommended by a friend so we happily waited in line for about 30-40 minutes.  And on a Thursday morning mind you. I was a bit excited to hear that they opened one quite close to where I live as it sure brings back fond memories of SF.

THE PLACE: This Dottie's location is triple the size of the original. Especially if you include the patio dining.  We went on a weekday, and of course there was plenty of seating. For all who live in the valley, we all know how dead Old Town Scottsdale is during the week especially post spring training.   Place is new, so it is very clean. We opted to dine in the patio area,  but tables were dust free.  Only dislike, if someone is smoking, the smoke will find its way to you. There is free WiFi, but I couldn't figure it out. Thought to ask, but forgot as that was not may main purpose of going there.

THE SERVICE: Hubby and I were allowed to sit anywhere we like, choosing a spot at the patio. We were seated in no time at all and had menus in our hands.  Beverages came quickly. The space is big, and so I can see where some spots may get lost in the shuffle and coverage by the service crew.  The young man who served us was very friendly, he would check on us every so often, but not as often as I would prefer. It is somewhat of a challenge to flag them if you are outside and the team is in an enclosed area. We needed butter and had to wait until someone walked by to be able to ask for some.  At the end of the meal, I ordered for a muffin to go, opting for the Brown Sugar and Cream Cheese one. Between the walk from our table to the walk to the pastry counter our server forgot and ended up packing us a Peach Muffin. No biggie!  Maybe some old fashion pad and pen?  

THE FOOD: Coffee was good. Food is as I remembered. The servings are big, and so I always prefer to share or take left overs home.  If you do share, you would still have room for a pancake which is one I would not skip out on :)  What I like:

  - Pulled Pork, Roasted Onion And Jack Cheese Scramble with flour tortilla and home fries, slow roasted with our own blend of herbs and spices and chili sauce
  - Smoked Whiskey-Fennel Sausage, Mushroom And Baby Spinach Scramble with grilled chili-cheddar corn bread & home fried
  - Dottie's Famous Pancakes* whole wheat buttermilk, spiced with ginger and cinnamon. served with pure maple syrup

Okay, the baked items, I have tried twice now and both times, they were not as good as I had thought.  It is very so-so and bland.

TIP: Simply curious?  Save yourself the hassle and go on a weekday. Weekends are too crazy. If you must go on a weekend, try an off hour or maybe an hour before they close. That way, you are not infuriated by the time you get your meal. WiFi, ask where you can get before being seated. It quite possibly be limited to one side of the cafe.

FOR THE RESTAURANT: Might I suggest more servers checking on folks on the patio.  Maybe equip the team with pad and pen for orders. Some greens would be welcomed in the patio area to give your customers some privacy and protection from smoke, smog.

Would I come back ... quite possibly. This is a new place, I'm hoping it would only get better with more practice.",0
trn_782,"//Only place in the downtown core//(Update: Mandy's now too) you can find a vegetable meal that doesn't also require a commitment to vegan or raw foods. 

The lunch hour opening hours and fast depleting daily menu will require planning and an open mind on your part. Never come here with a insatiable craving for something specific.

The variety of soups is fun to return to throughout the week. The only soft spot is the almost non existent spice. Which isn't to say they lack flavour, but rather any sort of kick or daring you might expect from a place so dedicated to the broth arts. 

Super affordable unless you also want a sandwich, in which case be prepared for a $20 lunch.

I came in on Sunday and got tips and a pedicure.  It took about 90 minutes which wasn't bad as most if it was spent soaking my feet in the massage chair.  The lady next to me didn't like her nail color and they changed it at no charge.
This was my first time getting tips but I think they look very good.  I'll see how long they last.
The service was wonderful but it wasn't as clean as it could have been.  Nothing to make you say eeew but the floor needed some attention.

There were fresh hush puppies on it which were the perfect substitution for croutons!  Mom's sides were coleslaw (creamy) and baked beans.  I enjoyed the beans.  I'm not a creamy coleslaw chick but ma appeared to like it. There are approximately 4 different BBQ sauces to choose from; from spicy to sweeter.  All were good.  

You order at the counter & they bring the food to your table.  Old Carolina BBQ is great for either dine-in or take-out.  They cater too.  In fact, I think I may be ordering from them in the future for a catered event.

I came home from dropping my oldest at camp, and a small excavator is sitting in my yard, with large holes and broken sprinkler pipes sticking up, and 5 large men with ""piedmont gas"" sitting staring at the mess. 
I believe the first words out of my mouth were ""Who the hell are you and what did you do to my property?""
Suffice to say I had no notice no call they had never permission to be on my property and they had destroyed something that belonged to us. I was on it like stink on you know what. (In case you're interested their excuse was that the neighbors next-door had requested them to help them find their gas line blah blah blah.) The foreman of the crew immediately agreed to help and we contacted the supervisor Jerome a d after some urgent choice words he was happy to find someone to come fix it that day. He not only said he was going to sure someone came to fix it, but he actually did it and kept me up-to-date on the progress, and the local irrigation company he found actually showed up by 5 o'clock that afternoon to completely fix the pipes.  After his initial blasé attitude had passed, Jerome was more interested in apologetic as a day unfolded. I think they're not used to homeowners objecting to whatever they do I have no clue. Anyway from what I hear changed their policy and are required now to notify residents before they come onto the property.
Not sure that this deserves three stars even, but I'm trying to throw them a bone. I mean it could've required me to call lawyers but thankfully I didn't have to get to that. Who has the time for that BS. Hope they get their act together.  Thank you Jerome for lighting a fire under it.

trn_802,"*Disclaimer - I'm not sure that this was the actual location I went to.  It's either this one or the other one on Sunset.

First and foremost, the fact that I'm giving a sandwich shop 5 stars is pretty impressive.  I'm typically not much of a sandwich person.  Often times I find sandwiches to be kind of boring and really, only eat it if I'm trying to find a healthier alternative to fast food.  Well, let me tell you, Capriotti's is not boring and it's probably not much healthier than a fast food joint.  What Capriotti's is, is delicious (how many times can I use ""is"" in a sentence and still be grammatically correct?).  

I checked this place out while I was out in Vegas through the recommendation of a co-worker who swears by the Bobbe.  Basically a Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form, it comes packed with real chunks of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/t3AWGr757V4Fvcun6sDsuw?select=K9tLR5HkxU-9tYZ1STmqYw).  Being a huge fan of cranberry sauce on my turkey sandwiches I just had to try it and it definitely didn't disappoint.  The turkey was tasty and not dry, the stuffing was flavorful, and the sandwich had just the perfect amount of cranberry sauce.  It was DELICIOUS!  

I also had a chance to try the cheese steak and a roast beef with coleslaw sandwich.  Both were phenomenally good.  I really wish this place were in California.  Please come to California Capriotti's!",1

trn_805,"This was a nice buffet experience for my brother and me.  We were in a hurry and didn't know exactly what we wanted.  We parked for free n the lot to the north of the structure which costs $8.  We could've also parked across the street.  As we were checking out the price chart, the cashier said. ""Get a game card and save a few bucks each""...so we did, and didn't even play and lose money like most people do in Vegas.  We asked to be seated away from the smoky front, so that was nice we were in the very back.  

I like the layout with the scribbled names of the items on the glass above they serving dishes.  Not everything was great, but I liked the selection with the typical Asian, Mexican, BBQ, fish, pork, pasta, etc. I tend to eat mostly vegetables at buffets and one piece of fried chicken.  Their chicken was decent, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and slightly greasy. But that slab of prime rib cooked medium in the center was calling my name.  It was pretty darn good with au jus and their real mashed potatoes with skin. 

Their corn cobette and green beans both had some butter in the water which made for a much better taste than other places that don't.  The salad bar was decent and I liked their cole slaw.  Our attendant was very good about taking up used plates really quickly and refilling my iced tea and coffee.  The fruit this time of year was really good.  I had a slice of their banana cream pie and red velvet cake.  Both just OK.  I would say that for $12, it was a pretty good value and experience.  

As another yelper pointed out, lots of people really pig out at these places. Gluttony haven in Vegas.  They stack their plates like they just all their money...and maybe they did and can't eat till they get paid again.  Overall,  It was clean, the food and service were decent on this trip, and I would go back.",1
trn_806,"Literally the worst service that ive ever experienced. Not only are they incredibly rude and unprofessional, but they have refused to come back and fix my appliances that they did not fix the first time. The owner and his son or grandson or whatever he is are literally psychotic. Screaming at me on the phone saying i am a liar that my washer still does not work after they ""fixed it"" twice. Why would o want to keep letting you fools into my house if I don't need to? Tried to call other places in the area and they are TERRIFIED to come look at my washer now because Perla has such a bad reputation and they are afraid they will be help liable! Some even said ""we never follow perla, we would lose too much money on the damages they have done"".",-1
trn_807,"As a Phoenix native, back for the holidays, I was looking forward to enjoying an old favorite of mine. I I used to frequent 32 Shea when it first opened, and since moving away, make an attempt to eat there at least twice whenever I am back I town. I was looking forward to a quality meal in a lovely atmosphere. The restaurant was a little empty, so I was expecting maybe a softer atmosphere, but to my surprise, the manager seemed to just talk louder at her employees. My cocktails were prepared incorrectly by the same manager who seemed more eager to close up early than to pay attention to the patrons. I was unclear as to who I should order from as people informed her she had a diner and she just ordered the others to do tasks for her, while she reminisced about drinking and talked about leaving for her new job. She infantilized her employees as though talking to small children, when some of them seemed to be older and more mature than her. The food, per usual was amazing, but the single individual who seemed more than happy to be gone and starting a new job while brushing all responsibility off onto her employees, all but ruined my meal. Next time I will stick to the outside seating area. Thank you for continuing to provide quality food!",-1
trn_808,"Let me start off by saying that I love shopping at local boutiques and I really wanted to love Lotus. The store is very bright, clean and inviting, but that is pretty much the only positives  I could say. The items there seem like over price sweat shop crap. Everything seems to be made of cheap jersey and/or polyester. Pretty much Forever 21 quality with four times the price tag. I did buy what I thought would be a cute cocktail dress, an embellished necklace, and earrings. What a waste of money! A seam on the dress became undone after one wear!! The rhinestones came off the necklace, and the earrings turned in color.  NEVER AGAIN!!!",-1

First it was the music was to loud then it was that we were to loud! What a disappointment! They did have Mariachis that were really good and they even came to our side and sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl and sang a few more songs. The overall I wouldn't do another party here..",-1

trn_817,"I'm #1 Gold.  Upon arrival in Las Vegas, I rode the bus to the rental car center and went directly upstairs to the Hertz lot.  My name was not on the Gold board.  Went back downstairs and stood in line to talk to an agent.  Agent said because my flight was delayed, I was determined to be a no-show and they cancelled my reservation, even though Hertz had my flight number (they obviously do nothing with that information).  Agent assigned me another car.  I went back upstairs to the lot but the space number he gave me was empty (no car).  I went back downstairs and spoke with the same agent.  He didn't seem too surprised and gave me another car.  I went back upstairs and, yes, that spot was empty, too.  Back downstairs again.  He assigned yet another car, but this time I made him contact someone to personally verify there was a vehicle there (there was).  So, back upstairs, loaded the car, and I was on my way.

I used to be a loyal Hertz customer but switched to National a couple of years ago because of similar experiences.  I decided to try Hertz again on this trip.  I can see they haven't improved, so I'll be going back to National.  The problem above would never happen at National because you get to choose among any of the available cars.",-1

Topped with the most wonderful Hollandaise! Next was a deconstructed Salad with Avocado, Roasted beets and Goat Cheese...Great!  Then Shortribs braised in Vanilla and Expresso with Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Cheese and Roma Tomato Grits! Ended it all with a Great Figgy Cake!!

trn_825,"Yesterday I went to Hawthornes for the first time because I wanted to try it based upon recommendations from others. My boyfriend and I walked to the bar and were not greeted right away by the bartender even though the bar only had 3 other people sitting there and she was only getting a check for someone. After about 10 mins, we were finally greeted and given a menu. We ordered a 9 inch cheese and pepperoni pizza to share and 14 long island wings to go. My boyfriend ordered a bud light and the bartender was nice enough to recommend a local cider for me that she thought that I was like. It was actually very good so I was glad she recommended that. It wasn't a very long wait for our food so we were pretty pleased with that. The bartender gave us the wrong check by mistake but quickly corrected it after we brought it to her attention. As we left,  she did not thanked us for our time for our business so we did not leave a tip. When, I got home I opened up the pizza box and the pizza looked very oily and was very thin. The pizza tasted unfortunately just as it looked. It tasted very oily and let flavor probably because it was so thin. The crust however was delicious, you can tell it was homemade. The wings did not have enough flavor as the whole thing wasn't even sauced. The wings had a lot of potential to be great as the part of the wings that did have sauce tasted delicious. There wasn't even enough sauce to dip the dry chicken wing parts in. I don't know if I'd recommend it but I may come back and try something different one day.",0

That being said, this quaint and trendy spot located in a corner of a shopping plaza blew my mind.  OMG! Was the food delicious.  Came in on a Saturday after noon and there was ample seating to accommodate the handful of patrons.  There are roughly 12 4 seat tables and about the same number of stools at the bar area.  Between the wife and I we ordered the Miso, Nishikawa, Pork Gyoza, Spring Roll and a chicken appetizer that I can't recall the name .  I highly recommend making time to check Nishikawa Ramen out.",1

Food: we had the deviled eggs as they were recommended by the waiter, best I have ever had. We then split the chicken and waffle meal, best fried chicken we have ever had and even the waffle was amazing. Banana puddling also really good.

Great atmosphere, waiter very friendly and gave great recommendations.

Highly recommended place. We will come back next time we are in Vegas.",1
trn_828,"I've been an Allstate customer since the 90s, and Regan and Ginger have been the best Allstate agents I've had. I am basing my review mostly on the service I've had with them since my move to Vegas in 09. When I moved to Vegas, Ginger took great care of getting me set up with Nevada insurance, DMV and smog check info. It was reassuring to have an agent who looked out for me when I was moving from IL to NV, she was very knowledgeable and responded very quickly. 

Regan is a great agent - I really like him and would refer him to anyone. He is very personable, professional, and calls you back in a timely manner. A bit of advice for those who call this agency about their policy -- I recommend only talking to Regan or leaving a message for him. The woman who answers the phone there is not the most polite or customer-service oriented person. I called earlier this month to inquire about my rate increase and she was short with me. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I would avoid her and just deal with Regan. 

Unfortunately, Allstate has nationally raised their rates the last two years, forcing me to shop around and I just switched to State Farm this month. Minus one star from this review for the recent rate hike. Last year my auto policy went up $17 a month, and then AGAIN this year's policy renewal stated my rates significantly increased another $19 a month, from $134 to $153 a month for a 10 year old car that I own. I was in their their ""Safe Drivers Program"" accident-free, no claims, and with excellent credit, and yet my rates went up. Preposterous. I wouldn't let this deter anyone from calling for a quote though, as you never know if their rates may end up being more competitive.  

I also appreciate the courtesy call I received from Regan after I cancelled my policy. He wanted to know, of course, why they lost the business (I am sure he was not surprised as to my reason) and it was nice to know that some businesses still care enough to call their long-term customers to say they are sorry to see you go. I am sure they say that to everyone, but I wasn't really expecting a phone call. Even though I can't justify staying with Allstate for obvious financial reasons, I will say if you are looking for a new agent I would encourage you to give Regan a call.",1

trn_832,"Yes, the line is long - we waited about 30 mins on a Friday morning, but they have a menu posted on the wall, and once you order it only takes about 8 mins to get your food. 

PLEASE people - don't be like the couple in front of us who waited in line for 30 mins - only to get to the counter to be indecisive. They were asking all kinds of questions and humming and hawing, then they shuffle through their purse to find their money to pay. Idiots!

We ordered a bacon sandwich and a original eggslut to split. The sandwich was the winner, they do NOT skimp on bacon and the roll is nice and fluffy. I'm glad we tried the eggslut, it really should come with 2 eggs since the ratio of potatoes and eggs is way off. Also the toast that came with it wasn't properly toasted and a bit flabby. (easy fix, they should be more on their game for that.)

Glad I tried it, would happily go to the NYC location.",1
trn_833,"I had the pleasure of having my nails done by Kristy today.  I have tried numerous salons in Sauga and wasn't happy with any of them until now! 

Allure will be my new go-to spot.  They are so clean and tidy.  Doesn't look cluttered and all the colour choices are hung in the waiting area and really organized by colour palette.  
This is the first place I've been to where I felt welcome.  I was greeted by Kristy when I came in.    I'm so used to nail salon techs talking to each other in their own language and I've always found that rude.  Not here! The other two girls were making conversation with their clients while we all watched Kim's Convenience and laughed.  It was like being with your girlfriends.

Kristy did a great job on my nails.  She asked for my approval along the way, did quality checks and even took time to make sure my nails were evenly filed.  She offered me my file and buffer as they don't reuse those items.  Tools came right out of the sanitized kit.  I was really impressed with this place.

I don't think walk ins are allowed as it states you should make an appointment.  This also made my appointment relaxing.

I will definitely be a regular.  Thanks Kristy!",1

trn_847,"WARNING: DO NOT USE LARRY'S TOW!!! Unless you want a really bad experience! SAD!!!

First and only negative review (I do not like negatives, but this a must to warn others!)

Same complaint submitted to BBB and formal verbal complaint to AAA:

At approx. 1500 hrs, on 08/15/17, I called AAA Premier Service to request a 185-mile (flat-bed)tow from Primm Outlet Mall, Primm, Nevada (Nevada Stateline with California)to Rancho Cucomonga, CA (the closest friend's address).  AAA referred to Larry's Towing in Las Vegas, Ca as their contract Towing company.  I called Larry, the owner, who explained the 185-mile tow would take 6 hours due to slow speed/DOT regulations/and vehicle inspections.  Larry said he had no driver.  So, they would take my SUV to the tow yard and tow it at 1800 hrs, arriving in Ranco Cucamonga about midnight. I was OK with it: provided all info to Employee Jacob, secured SUV, and headed back to California with another person.  Arrived home at 1930 hrs., I called Larry's Tow and Jacob told me they did not tow the SUV, ""The guy (tow truck driver) showed up but it was too hot. So, he didn't want to work and went back to Wyoming.""  Jacob they would tow in the morning, new shift at 0600 hours.  

At approx. 0830 hrs., on 08/18/18, I called Larry's towing and spoke with a female (Jenny/Denise?) who said my SUV was still in tow yard, and waiting for a driver.  I advised her I and a friend had taken a day off to wait for my SUV in Rancho Cucamonga, friend's house.  She said she will call me in an hour.  No calls received (ever!). At 1000 hrs., I called again and same lady said no driver available and will call me with updatest.  No calls received, again.  

At 1110 hrs. I arrived at friend's house in Rancho Cucamonga to waid for my SUV.  At 1230 hrs., I called again, explained needing the vehicle towed and no communication, same lady said she was still waiting for driver and will call me back.  No calls received.  At 1530 hours. (24-hours after initial call for service), I called and spoke with Larry, the owner, and explained this ridiculous circumstances of waiting more than 24 hrs to tow my vehicle - only credit: the lady and Larry did apologize - but it's too late.  Larry claimed his only flat bed truck had problems and was getting service quote from Ford dealership.  I told him that in the past 24 hours, I was the only person calling and checking on a tow that had not occurred and no one from Larry's Towing had called or text me with any updates at all - unexcusable and extremely poor customer service, very disappointing as my friend and I had lost a day of work waiting. Larry asked if it was 2-wheel drive which I told him it was, same said 24 hours ago. Larry suggested a regular tow (having my 2-wheel on ground while towing)and I was OK with it.  Larry said they driver would tow at 1800 hours but Larry could not promise the time, giving excuse of hooking up and inspectint vehicle.  I asked if Larry could promise to be out of tow yard and head to California before 1900 hours,and CALL/NOTIFY me. Larry could not commit. My friend drove me home at 1600 hours. 

At approximately 0230 hours, on 08/17/17, my friends texted me that my SUV had just arrived at his house in Rancho Cucamonga (34 hours after original call of service!).  The newly 2-week employed driver told my friend that he left the tow yard at approx. 2100 hours, 08/16/17. I arrived friend's house at 1300 hours and noticed an 18""+ deep scratch diagonal accross the hood of my SUV (damaging it!), can see the white primer under blue paint and clear coat.  My friend said the tow truck driver has a magnetized flashing light on top of hood used during the tow.  My SUV was tow front facing backward with two rear wheels lifted/hooked up to tow truck.  Unbelieble towing experience: complete dishonesty, incompetence, and lack of business sense and/or care for customer. None.  Worst customer service experience in my 31 years of driving and 23 years of working as law enforcement officer - still current.  I have filed a formal complaint to AAA.  

During the 34 hours tow ordeal, Larry and none of his employee had never called or text me with any updates, advise, anything - so sad that this kind of incompetent business dealing exist!  I did not know about other YELP and BBB complaints until I researched during the 2nd day waiting for my suv!  I didn't mind the wait as much as the lack of communication, stringing me a long for hours and hours without calling - that is a total BS!!!

Larry - please revampt/change your business practice and you will make a lot more money with really happy customers who will truly respect, enjoy doing (repeated) business with you, and will do free advertsing for you! It's not rocket science, Larry - it's common sense in treating people with honesty, fairness, and openess. Just be honest and communicate nicely/directly/timely with people/customers! You and your misguied crew and do it, Larry!",-1
trn_848,"I havent touched a comic book in about 15 years.  I've recently decided to get back into it and I cant say enough about Drawn to Comics in downtown Glendale.  I think I've been to every comic book shop in Phoenix and the surrounding areas and Drawn to Comics is hands down the best comic book shop in town.  Ken and his Wife are incredibly nice people, willing to help in anyway they can.  Ken truly has a passion for the comic book world and is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to anything comics.  I find myself stopping in multiple times a week and anytime I find myself in the area.  They have a large back issue selection and the back issues are in pretty fantastic condition for the most part.  Their back issue prices are competitive and a lot of the times lower than All About Books and Comics on Central.  If your looking for anything comic book related, do yourself a favor and stop by Drawn to Comics in downtown Glendale.

Update:  July 06, 2012
Just a brief update on the current shape of Drawn to Comics.  Its fantastic.  I wish Yelp would let me add additional stars.  Ken and Susan are such fantastic people and with a such a friendly and knowledgeable staff you could find yourself in the shop for hours on end. when you just happened in to pick up your weekly/biweekly/monthly comic book or action figures.  Be forewarned before stepping into this amazing shop.  You might experience the following symptoms:  Extreme Joy, Jubilation, Amazement, Comfort, Fleeting Wallet Syndrome, and last but not least, Happy Tears.  Ken, Susan, Daniel, Jason, Chris, Carlos thank you for being such a wonderful group of people that are genuinely excited about the comic book world and not in it for greedy ambition.",1

trn_857,"On an impromptu dinner, a coworker and I decided to try somewhere close to our houses. I'm always in the right mood for sushi, so I thought this place was going to work out just right. I'm glad we chose it, because I had a great time!

The intersection this restaurant sits on is a busy one for the area. It's filled with grocery stores, shops, restaurants, gas stations and bars. Definitely a lively area for Henderson. When you walk in, you'll notice a very modern place. After the hostess station there are separated date night rooms to the right and another dining area to the left.  The big focal point in this restaurant is the sushi bar, taking up almost half the restaurant. Business signs, flat screen tvs and exposed ceiling air ducts bring out the modern look for sure. Along with the wall dividers and the sushi bar, bamboo plants are used to break out the room into smaller intimate dining areas. Our servers were really nice. They were accommodating and very attentive when they were around. At times, it was hard to flag one down as they would congregate on the far side of the restaurant, away from the guests. Also, there's a ""head honcho"" lady that works the hostess station.  I say head honco because she certainly acted like it. She walked around eating, speaking loudly, kind of a turn off. If she was meaning to let everyone know that she was the boss, she certainly did that with no shame. 

For starters, I got the White Truck pinot grigio wine for $7 a glass. It was light, crisp with a sweet ending. Super refreshing for my meal. For my starter, I got the Hamachi/Yellowtail collar for $8.95. I can't get enough of this stuff! Grilled yellowtail served with a ponzu sauce. Super flaky and marbleized. Grilled to perfection. One only piece of feedback: it came after my actual meal came. Speaking of, I decided on the chicken katsu for $12.50. Breaded chicken, deep fried and served with katsu (ketchup based) dipping sauce. The meal was served with miso soup and salad. The plate came with a scoop of rice and grilled veggies. I thought the chicken was light, the breading wasn't too heavy and super crispy. The sauce was a little to dark and strong from my ""kastu"" taste. Seemed to have a lot of Worcestershire sauce or similar. The veggies were sauteed in soy sauce and a little too salty but at least brought another element to the fried dish. All in all, I'd say it was pretty flavorful!

I'm so glad to have discovered another sushi restaurant close to home! Sushi is something I can eat again and again. Although I had no sushi on this night, I really enjoyed myself and the company. If you're ever in the area and looking for a place to welcome you and your company, stop by The Sushi. It's a surprisingly great treat!",1

trn_860,"I am a HUGE fan of Papa Chang's! It is hands down the best Taiwanese restaurant in the GTA that I've tried. Unfortunately the express location doesn't offer the same quality or quantity of food as the other locations. I had the Taiwanese sausage with minced pork on rice, and my sausages were tiny! My fiance got the braised pork bento box, and you could tell that the sides were reheated and even the sauce was kind of jelly-like. It was still good, but definitely under performs the 16th/markham rd and richmond hill locations.",-1
trn_861,"Food is bland and portions are really small for the price. They charge way too much for a portion that will not make you full. The butter chicken comes in a small bowl ($14) and it had like 5 pieces of meat. It was so bland. The other dishes we received were just as bland and horrible. All their prices are way overpriced compared to the amount they give you and especially the long wait you have endure to receive your food. 

Honestly wouldn't recommend this place, you can get BETTER TASTING food and especially MORE FOOD for a cheaper price. Spent around $35 and it wasn't worth one penny.",-1
trn_862,"I went to Steve's as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.

It has a nice atmosphere, and I love the patio.

We were only there for about 30 minutes, but in that time, I was pleased with the level of service we received, and with the chips and salsa.

The chips are kinda different, almost like fried wontons in their texture. They were delicious. And the salsa had a nice flavor, and decent heat.

I was hoping to have breakfast after the crawl, but I was too exhausted (old) and had to head home long before that happened.

I will definitely go back to Steve's, and especially to try their breakfast menu.

trn_863,"I did countless hours of research on laser hair removal before I started my treatment. Simplicity Laser had the type of laser I needed based on my skin/hair color (Yag laser), so I choose to go with them. 

I purchased them off GroupOn, but their regular prices are fantastic! They are definitely cheaper compared to the rest of the valley, but be assured that doesn't mean they cut corners! All of the technicians are very knowledgable and friendly. My appointments are always running on schedule and usually go quicker than anticipated. I'm always in and out. 

One thing I'm not a fan of is when you call the facility, it goes to a call center. They don't have a direct line. The call center handles all of the appointment scheduling, however I wish it could be done online instead of being kept on hold. On the upside, they do let you schedule up to 3 appointments ahead of time. 

Everyone's results vary based on skin/hair, but the treatment worked great for me! I'm extremely happy with Simplicity.",1

We finally tried it today and we were very disappointed.  

We ordered the family meal.  Full chicken, rack of ribs, and three sides.   The chicken was dry.  The ribs were okay...tasted like they were boiled.   And the sides were mediocre.  The family meal was $50. 

They have one flavor of BBQ sauce.  It tasted like regular KC Masterpiece.  They had one hit sauce, which tasted like Frank's Red Hot.  

Service was good.  Location was convenient.  Food was mediocre.  We won't be back.",-1

Parker's has been Queenie's place for daycare (and lots of overnights!) for close to 8 years - and they are truly amazing! Queenie's excitement every single morning is proof. I'm just thrilled knowing my girl is so well taken care of and is always happy when I pick her up at the end of the day. Everybody from management to staff is wonderful - they are knowledgeable, passionate, professional and so attentive. It's clear they take the time to know your dog so they can provide the best quality care. I could not imagine our life without them, and I know it would be impossible to find another kennel that could even come close to offering the experience we are so familiar with and ever so grateful for....Thank you to everyone at Parker's for always ensuring Queenie's care comes first.",1
trn_867,"The $55 Treatment is NOT the way to go!! We would've paid less just purchasing the items.
The server pushed 'The Treatment' for dinner and said it would be a way to taste different items and they would bring more of the items we liked. We received a lot of food, some we liked and others we would've never ordered. The server never came back to ask if there were items we would like again. Total for The Treatment Option was $220 and if we would've just paid for the food brought to the table we would've only paid $174.  So, we lost $46 plus the added tax and tip gratuity. Total the table spent around $400 for food and drinks.

trn_869,"Let me start my review by saying that I'm a rather picky person when it comes to hair stylists.  I'm particular when it comes to attention to detail.  A good trim is pretty hard to find, but not anymore.  

JESSICA is the real deal.  She is sweet, professional, and is all about attention to detail.  She gave me the best shampoo job that I think I've ever had.  It was more of a head massage really.  It was a struggle not to fall into a deep hypnotic slumber as she massaged my temples.  I couldn've sworn I was going to have to pay extra for that kind of attention, but turns out, that's just how she works.  What a star!

The other great thing I loved about this salon were the store hours.  They are open later than most (till 8pm, during the week), which is perfect for me.  

Looking forward to trying out more of what they offer in the future.",1

trn_882,"If you just want the skinny- Delish!!!! Authentic! Genuine! A wee bit overpriced with the add ons. DO NOT let that deter you. Read on for enjoyment purposes only.

Okay- I never write posts, but I feel obligated to do so here. Let me preface by saying I am a FOODIE, I work in the restaurant industry, I live to find great places to eat, and I travel...A LOT.
So today I had to drive up to Pittsburgh for work and ended up landing at the Residence Inn in Oakland, PA, because:
 A. I waited to long to book at the Hampton, and B. Love the Marriot Rewards points.

Needles to say, I arrived late, tired, and a wee bit dissapointed at my lodging accomodations (the staff makes up for it in friendliness and hospitality).

 None the less it is time for dinner, and of course the Front Desk is pitching this allegedly ""AMAZING"" italian restaurant (they even had a sign in the lobby)- by the way just accross the street and the ONLY restaurant on the street (and it's not the prettiest of streets mind you). Any of those reading this that travel shares my first thought of ""Danger Danger... Do not eat there!"". 

But, all they had downstairs were stoffers mac n' cheese, and some chicken chinese stir fry, so I decided to spend some time not catching up on email and take a look at the Zarra's menu online. Once I started reading, the interest of the 2nd generation Italian in me was peaked. 

So I gave in and gave them a call. Maybe I got lucky... I don't know, but I got the nicest coolest guy on the other end of the line. It goes like this...
""Zarras , Good Evening?""
""Hi, what time do you close?""
""Ahh...we're open and seating, what time do you want to eat?""
""""Oh I just got in and am staying at the hotel across the street and was checking.""
""Oh yeah, come on over, we'll gett you seated""
""Can I order something to be delivered to?""
""Sure thing we can do that""
""Ok great, I'll call you right back""

I was so stoked by the non a-hole response that I normally get, where a restaurant sums me up as the 8:45 pm wishy washy annoying last minute order of the evening, that I called back 5 minutes later to order something (even though I realized at that point I wasn't hungry).

I will paraphrase this conversation for those that I have lost, am about to lose, or who are just plain annoyed by my endless diatribe (I can't help it! I dig this place!). A lady answered and asked for my order. I asked her what is good and she knew the menu and started rattling things off.

We landed on the ricotta pasta with meatballs AND sausage (I'm italian- if they say they make both from scratch- GAME ON), with a side salad w/homemade balsamic.She told me about all of the desserts they make from scratch and extra tidbits of yumminess, but for once I stuck to my guns.Ironically- this was this biggest mistake of my life. I should have ordered one of everything, charged it to my company account, called in sick the next day, and just nurtured an Italian Indulgence/hangover.

I decided to walk accross the street and pick up the food. It is a small place in between what I can only describe as row houses (hey, I'm from San Diego and live in DC- give me a break). You walk into this dimly lit but nice and clean front sitting area with a bar. They were folding napkins and closing for the night. I won't go in to detail except to say- Cool, Genuine and Quarky characters. 

I wanted to sit at the bar and start chatting with everyone working there. A guy in his 30's offered to seat me right away, and then the lady who took my order came over to help me. Everyone was of course Italian and REAL! But the best- an older Gentleman dressed better than any man I've ever dated (owner?) that told me before the restaurant this place was the Electric Banana (I have not researched that yet- assuming an 80's accident in naming vs what I'm thinking). What I got from him, was that he has been the owner since the getgo. I could literally write another 5 pages about just how fun and unique the people are that run this place.

I left with my food in tow wishing I could hang out and drink with those guys. Came back to my room and started working, forgetting about my meal. SHAME ON ME! Then it hit me and I started unwrapping the 3-time foil-wrapped container (I'm already in love, because red sauce gets everywhere in the bag!). 

One sniff and one bite- this is like my grandma's, like mine (because my grandma taught me). Meatballs perfect. Ricotta pasta- not what I expected, but in a good way. It's like a gnocchi, but cut like pasta, but different. I dunno- it's good! Dressing delish, like visiting Long Island family. Sausage, chunky with whole fennel seeds...ding ding ding!

I only wish I had tried more there. I ordered the ricotta pasta because many of the other items were a bit steep- my only complaint. But with the quality tasted thus far, I can imagine it is well worth it!

Note to self- should I stay at the Residence Inn from now on, just so I can eat here? TO BE CONTINUED...",1

trn_886,"Today I was at the Carnegie Library for the annual seed swap. What a fun party. The library was a great place to learn about all of the things that you can plant, how to plant them, and where to plant them. And even though they had teachers they're the best part of it being a library you could always just go and find books on the topic.

The library was a great venue because it was large enough to accommodate the many things that the seed swap was doing as well as not disrupt the loyal patrons just looking to get books out. I love the library and I really love this event.

The staff here always really helpful and will always point you in the right direction. So if you have any questions make sure that you reach out to them because they will help you in any way that they can.

There's also a Crazy Mocha inside of the library so if you need us something to snack on or drink while perusing the shelves it's there. I personally like an iced tea while I'm reading but you get whatever you want.

Well this is not my local neighborhood Library I still love coming here. It always has fun events and great service. Check it out if you're in Oakland it's a beautiful building and will be awesome to get some books out from here. Tell me what you think!!!",1

Like a previous review I read - it was an extremely disappointing experience. I paid for a full gel manicure yet they barely did any grooming or cuticle work, there was a large gap between my cuticle and the start of the polish, and I didn't receive any massage/moisturizer. I mentioned to the girl that she didn't do anything to my cuticles and she responded that ""she doesn't do that with gels"".. (?not sure why?) So I essentially paid $35 for another person to paint my nails and do nothing else. Afterwards I complained to the manager and they went back and had the girl remove the polish and do it again but with some grooming.. She did a rushed job and the polish was full of bubbles and chipped by the time my wedding occurred 3 days later.. Extremely disappointing service for what I paid- buyer beware!",-1

It was $10 though, which is fine but I'm used to paying cheaper than 6 dollars for pho. Also, I feel like pho is known for how cheap it is and how big portions you get. 

The food was really tasty.  There is a little self serve pho bar, where you get your sides like sauce, limes, bamboo, greens, etc. I like how the restaurant has their own variety of sauces to add to your pho. I did also notice that the soup didn't come with that much noodles. There was a lot of beef though! Which is a plus. The proportions didn't really even out. 

4 stars for the food and friendly customer service. Minus one star because of the price.

As for the desserts, I'd come here just for the desserts alone! The bread pudding and vanilla custard ice cream were the best I've ever had. I would pay an arm and a leg just to buy it in my city. Every time I'm in Vegas, I'll make sure to come back just for that.",0

We ordered two orders of chicken tenders and got a side of mashed potatoes and I can't say any of it was bad, just not great especially for how much you are spending on them.

Bought $800+ worth of Michelin tires on Apr 29, 2013 at your Surprise, AZ store on W Bell Rd. Joe was great and brought car to my home a mile away, as I am under doctor care for an ailing back. Returned May 9 for vibration issues and rebalance. Vance said it would be a while, and he would come get me at home, same as Joe. I told him I could probably walk home OK, but doubt if I could walk all that way back later. Vance called an hour later, said car was done but they were busy, and could they bring the car at 6:00 when they closed. I said yes and thanked him. At 6:00 manager Tony called me and said they don't deliver cars to homes (news to me!), and actually ARGUED with me for nearly 3 minutes, not letting me talk or explain what his staff had told me. I finally gave up and reluctantly walked back to get the car. Took me nearly 30 minutes to walk back, cutting through a large dirt commercial lot to save a few steps. There was no one in the office to greet me, although there were still customers around, but no sign of Tony. Found my keys on the counter, unattended, took them and left. Saw Joe in the parking lot and told him what Tony had said, and Joe said he would have been happy to give me a ride, and to talk to him next time. There will be NO next time. As a customer for nearly 3 decades, I will never buy another tire from your stores again.",-1
trn_909,"This past Saturday, I was relaxing in my hotel room at the Hotel Indigo in Beachwood, Ohio, when a strange man gained entry to my room. Needless to say, I was more than terrified as I was in a state of undress and alone when it happened. When I frantically called the front desk to notify them of my intruder I was met with an unbelievable response of ""I know. We thought you checked out."" They had let a stranger into my room and endangered my safety, and I was barely offered an apology. 

When my fiancé spoke to the front desk about check out procedures we were told that people who are scheduled to check out are given receipts slipped under their doors. We never received one...because we were not scheduled to check out until the next day! He asked if key cards are deactivated upon check out and was met with a resounding ""YES"". Yet I was able to get into my room using my key card at 5:00PM. Because again, WE DID NOT CHECK OUT. So... WHY was our room given away and WHY was a stranger allowed to enter my room? 

Never mind our belongings. What would have happened if I had been assaulted, raped, kidnapped or murdered? I had been warned repeatedly about human-trafficking issues in Ohio prior to arriving, and this is a potentially serious safety issue for anyone who decides to stay at this hotel. 

On the day we DID check out, there was still no receipt under our door. Proof of their lack of protocol and procedure.  

My fiancé called the manager on Monday to talk about the issue and she told him that housekeeping said we checked out, as if housekeeping were in charge of all reservations? Does this even make sense? What is the front desk for if not maintaining and managing reservations? 

The Hotel Indigo is irresponsible, unprofessional and a security risk. To add insult to injury, not only did they try to place the blame on us, housekeeping, and the company that booked our room, they tried to buy us off with a coupon for two free drinks and complimentary breakfast to gloss the matter over. We declined. 

What was supposed to be a relaxing getaway with my fiancé has now turned into a very traumatic experience. I am petrified of staying in hotels because of the Hotel Indigo and you should be as well.",-1
trn_910,"I wish this place was closer to my house! I think I would be there everyday! I got 2 enchiladas with the 1/2 and 1/2 tortilla with one mashed potato and one with chicken! I think I could of eaten a whole bowl of mashed potato. They add either green or red, or even both sauces and cheese and put it in their brick oven and add some cabbage slaw! Everything just tasted so fresh! I will be going back very soon!",1
trn_911,"Stopped here for some breakfast on our second day in Montreal and everything was delicious. A fairly large brunch menu with so many options to mix and match your favorite breakfasts. Their potatoes are delicious-you have the option to substitute those for fruit but I still got a few pieces on my plate anyways. The eggs and brioche are delicious, the service was great. Gets crowded around lunch time but still a really cool atmosphere. Waiters and waitresses spoke English and French very well. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a big breakfast/brunch!!",1

Not also did he not apologize or try to rectify the problem, he just opened the cash register and slapped cash on the counter and walked away... versus reversing the credit card transaction!  How impersonal & rude!

 If I had known it'd take that long, I'd hit a drive thru on my way. Or sat down to eat!!!

I would have given 1 star but I could tell the cashier was getting agitated with their service and could tell if she could rectify the issue, she would have done so!",-1

The Carne Asada wet burrito was great, but the level of service for a small independently owned, family operated restaurant was beyond exceptional. The gentleman working the register made us feel right at home with his personable personality, and was quite courteous to anticipate our needs by bringing us a high chair for our little one. He was even so kind to provide us with a small side of complimentary beans for our young child, as he put in his words, ""don't worry about it it's for the kid..."" Definitely a breath of fresh air when it comes to service in small fast casual dining establishments. Great job Super B!",1

trn_918,"Let me preface this by saying that I have a wheat intolerance. I can eat it, but in limited quantities. That being said, this I believe is the best place to get a sandwich if you have to eat gluten free. I think their gluten free bread might just be better than their regular bread. My family is fast becoming regulars here. I've had better matzo ball soup elsewhere, and their meats are pretty standard. Service definitely favors if you are a regular, but it's easy enough to get a tasty meal. They will also sub sides and give you exactly what you want but it may cost you extra, they make sure to tell you when you order if it will. All in all, this place is a nice old style dinner deli that is good for those who are selective.",1
trn_919,"Vanessa-the membership manager at this GYM needs a few classes on customer service. She's very unpleasant and rude.
Vanessa came to help us with the wrong attitude I feel it's because when her co-workers called her over to help us,it interrupted her conversation she was having previously with other coworkers. 
Here's the deal Vanessa your job is to take care of members... and future potential members.
My father and I are in town for a week, this particular gym is nearest to our vacation rental.
My brother has a membership at LVAC we wanted him to join us working out. 
He has a seven day pass,took a while to find it.my dad pays the 1 day fee of 25$. 
Upon finding the seven day pass Vanessa says it's invalid clearly,it has dates on it and it's not expired.
Vanessa claims she can't reverse the payment process! Meaning everyday we came,we'd have to pay for my brother to join us!!! Is this gym struggling that much for business??? Vanessa doesn't help in situations like this. In customer service the customer isn't always right but... You should do what you can to help the customer,such as acknowledge passes that aren't expired. My dad and I have been members of 24Hr fitness for years and we've never encountered such horrible service.
I'd ask all my friends and family to not waste time or money coming here. Worst experience ever!",-1
trn_920,Best place to get ice cream. They have only two flavors but they can do so much with them. From milkshakes to mix-ins even treats for your four legged friends. It's inexpensive for all that you get. (Large ice cream cones can barely fit out the window) The staff are really nice too. They always make sure to get the order right. I believe that if you have the need to get ice cream I would definitely go here.,1

I was under the hood checking the fluids in preparation for the bad weather when I saw the battery was just sitting on the tray unsecured without its cover and the bolts that are meant to hold the battery in place were sitting on the dash cowling. Brought the car back for them to install the missing cover and resecure the battery and found out they installed the wrong type of battery in the first place. Thank God it was only the battery. I would hate to see if they had installed the wrong brakes or other integral safety related parts, or forgot to reinstall the right parts incorrectly. I will never let them near any of my vehicles again. Good luck buying a ""certified used"" car from them.",-1

We arrived on a Friday night and there was an acoustic performer that made it feel like a coffee shop. Don't be fooled by that since this place offers a variety of beers and other drinks. Menu ranges from sandwiches, appetizers, and pizza. The pizzas are ok,  nothing great or fancy. The sandwiches weren't bad either. What made it great was the bartender. She was super nice and suggested drinks and food for our group. One thing to remember is you can't tip on your debit or credit card, cash only tip.",0

Service was friendly, fast and attentive in both visits. This seems to be a popular neighbourhood spot, full by 7:00 with a mix of young people, middle-aged business men, and older friends sharing an early dinner--cheerful and chattery, not a spot for a lingering tete a tete. The patio gets you close to the lively street scene.",1

trn_931,"7 of us gathered in the private dining room to enjoy a birthday meal for one of the group.  We had secured the private dining room and for the next three hours--approximately--we enjoyed a serious of dishes representing many of the offerings of this relatively new restaurant along restaurant row at the Venetian Hotel.

Drinks were brought and shortly thereafter our courses were brought to us as selected by Chef Harrington, executive chef for Yardbird.  The items served were:

Fried green tomato BLT
Low and slow smoked chicken salad
St. Louis style pork ribs
Smoked and roasted bone marrow with toast
Deviled eggs
Warm farmer's cheese on watermelon cubes
Mama's chicken biscuits
Chicken pot pie
Macaroni and cheese
Shrimp n' grits
Chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles
Short ribs
Chess pie
Bacon-butterscotch cake
Deep fried Oreos
House cobbler

Stand out dishes were the smoked chicken salad, chicken pot pie, chicken 'n'n watermelon 'n' waffles, Mama's chicken biscuits, and ALL of the desserts.  The chicken salad with cornbread and yogurt dressing was outstanding.  The biscuits in Mama's chicken biscuits are amazing, and the waffles served with the chicken and waffles with watermelon as simply amazing!  What flavor!  The chicken pot pie is not yet on the menu but the top crust was excellent and the chicken filling is different from a normal pot pie.  It also deserves much praise.  In my lifetime, I have not been accustomed to chicken and waffles Southern style.  While this serving didn't convert me, it went a long way to explaining to me why people like chicken and waffles so much.

One dish that needs work is the macaroni and cheese.  It just doesn't have a good cheesy flavor.  

As for the desserts, everything was excellent.  Having eaten so much prior to this, I forced myself to at least try everything served for dessert and it was so worth it!

Service was very good.  It was nice to enjoy the good food with friends in a quiet room cut off from the conversations of a restaurant full of people.

Thanks for a great evening, Chef Harrington.",1
trn_932,Great customer service with a passion to help their customers. They take a personal interest in your needs with great suggestions and effort.  They also work hard to work within your budget.,1
trn_933,"The portions were huge, the banana pudding was crazy delicious. Even though we were full, we ate the entire thing! The service was outstanding and our server gave great recommendations. The fried chicken was crispy, tender, and though I hate this word, moist. The Mac and cheese was fine, could have been hotter, but was good. They had an extensive beer selection as well.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience and would return next time in Vegas.",1
trn_934,"Getting into the parking lot from the busy intersection can be difficult. But I would say, the overall experience is worth it.

When I first walked in, no one was at the register but someone eventually came out and took our order. It was hard to hear him and it became confusing. However, another cashier came out and was very nice and clear. He was interested in what we thought of the food and was friendly. No one was rude and the overall appearance was very clean and well taken care of.

The food was very good. I order the Vegetarian Soul burger and the Classic Poutine. They give you a generous amount of toppings and a decent sized poutine. The patty in the soul burger tasted almost like meat and kept together really well.

I would return and recommend this as a great burger place.",1
trn_935,"Shared a two & one haddock fish & chips, so many chips (even though it was supposed to be a small portion)! Chips are some of the best we have had in a while, and the fish was SILKY SMOOTH!!!! Fried to perfection, and huge as well!

Small, cute restaurant, with some bigger tables in the middle if you had a bigger party.",1
trn_936,"What an excellent experience.  We combined our son and daughter's birthday parties there and had over 30 kids jumping, plus parents.  The staff was incredibly accommodating.  They weren't so concerned about watching the clock and the kids got some extra jump time.  The party hostess's were fantastic.  The managers (Steven and Medin) were phenomenal.  We even had a cake emergency and our cake maker called in the last minute and informed us we wouldn't be able to have the designer cakes we ordered in time for the party.  Medin went about and beyond, drove himself to Sam's and brought back cupcakes and cakes for both kids.  The kids had a blast, especially during the private dodge ball game they set up for the party.  I would go back there in a heart beat and recommended all of the party-goers who are thinking of doing a jump party to book here.",1

trn_939,Very creative and unique combination. May not be suitable for all audiences but if you like korean American fusion than it's definitely worth a try. Not something you would eat regularly but once a month cravings. Kimchee fries are a good balance to the hotdogs which can be too salty for sensitive taste buds.,1
trn_940,"My husband loves their food, but it is just okay to me. The inside doesn't look clean enough for me and they have long wait times. I still have no clue on their order system.

trn_944,"How in the world do you describe this place?
My wife and I were part of only 5 customers in the place. The other group received their food when we placed our order. The server that took are drink order  seemed a bit perturbed that I ordered tea instead of coffee I guess. Another server came over to take our order and did so professionaly. 
I ordered the egg white omelete with onions, mushrooms and provolone.
I received an egg white fold with mushrooms, lots of avocado and an oily cheese product, with cold potatoes made yesterday. 
I was afraid to send anything back. 
There was a large family hanging around like they own the place. They do. It's like going to your inlaw/outlaw house for breakfast but you would rather eat before you go and leave as soon as possible so you don't have to listen to their ignorant world view about everything you didn't ask about.
I think the sign on the front window says it all. It says I don't give a Crap about customers just fork over the cash cause we don't take cards.
Food is average at best.
Service is below average.
Decor kinda low.
Atmosphere, run by Tony Soprano's wife.
Attitude worse than can be described.

They first gave us the wrong room that was already occupied, then had to go back down to get a new room. Parking was horrible, had to end up parking at Harrahs. The rooms are filthy. The carpet has stains, and the furniture is tore up. The whole room smells bad. It was so bad, that by 7:30 that same morning we left to go stay in another hotel. But that is not all. I never thought that I would ever see a Caesars Entertainment Property have duct tape holding down the seams of the carpet in the hallway. Wow!!! I contacted the hotel once I got home, and below is their reply:

Dear Mr. XXXXXX,

Thank you for contacting The Quad and making us aware of your experience. Your comments are appreciated as it enables us to identify what we are doing correctly to satisfy our guests, as well as, discovering where adjustments can be made so we may continue providing the best products and service.

Let me begin by saying that I certainly understand your frustrations. We all set expectations before we travel and certainly the type of room that we will receive is one of those. I was disappointed to hear we were unable to meet your expectations with the room you received during your visit and apologize for any inconvenience. As a mature hotel, it is challenging to keep our product fresh and up to our brand standards, however, there is absolutely no excuse for you not to receive a room that affords you the comforts of home. The information you shared about the room and the front desk customer service issues will be addressed as soon as possible. Please be assured that our main goal at The Quad is to provide the finest in accommodations, products, and service to you, our valued guests. We know how much customers like you look forward to visiting Las Vegas and we are committed to delivering products and services that make it easy for everyone to enjoy their stay at our hotel. I regret that these challenges left a poor perception of The Quad. 

I hope you will take some comfort in knowing that all customer comments are taken seriously. Your business is truly appreciated and we hope you will give us another chance to serve you again in the near future.

I hope you have a good day, 

Really??? Epic Fail!!! Do not waste your time or money on this one!!",-1
trn_947,"One thing we don't like about getting a car rental at McCarran airport is the location. It's far away from the airport. That's not a problem but the problem starts when there's a road work. Sometimes you just want to get the car soonest you make your landing without having to unload luggages to a shuttle bus to get to another location, especially after a few hours flight. You would think that the car rental should really be in the same building the moment you arrive but no, they have to put them all the way out there somewhere and then let all shuttle passengers go thru a heavy traffic just to get to the car rental building. Sure there's a shuttle bus taking you to the rental car but it's no that much fun when you arrive late at night. On top of that please be aware that not all car rentals are in the same building so when you arrive at the place and if your car rental is located slightly further than the car rental building, you got to exit the shuttle and go to the other shuttle that take you to a specific car rental building. Meaning you got to unload your luggage and then load them to this other shuttle. I really hope any department that creates this would come out with a better strategy to handle this. We need a better way to take passengers to their specific car rentals whether it's in a major building or a different one. Making passengers loading in and out their luggages twice from one shuttle to another is not a smooth operation. Think of a better way to service your customers. Hope this will improve someday.

Both were covered  in  jalapeños (not mentioned on menu) both salads  were sent back and new ones were brought  out exactly the same.

Smokin Crawfish is the newbie on the block. Their signature spices just made my palette crave for more of their ""Smokin Style"" seasoning which contains all of their spices in one A-M-A-Z-I-N-G flavor! The right touch of sweetness, garlic, and spices makes this the ""WOW"" factor for me! The ""Garlic Butter"" is another must try! Don't let the name fool you! It's unlike any other garlic butter!

trn_966,"Hotpot! Hotpot! Hotpot! That's all I wanted at that moment. We came here on Sunday night for dinner. It wasn't too busy as most tables were empty. As many have mentioned, this place is pretty small but cozy. We sat on a table for four and our waiter was pretty attentive.  We ordered three hotpots with the two types of meat ($16.95) with the herbal broth. I got lamb and beef which was really yummy! Service was fast as we each got individual pots and a bowl of assorted things which included: cabbage, noodles, tofu, fish ball, mushrooms, an egg, etc. (Keep in mind that it was one piece per item). I actually liked this because it gave you an opportunity to taste a bit of everything! The broth was delicious and they keep refilling as you eat. I do have to say though, the sample platter was small but you can order additional things if you want.

Remember to check in through yelp! You get a pot of tea for free which is better than tap water. I wanted to try their other dishes as everything looked so delicious! In addition,  they gave us very small bite size dessert for free!! They also had a sale of bubble tea which was buy one get one free. One of the cons was that there were too many flies which kept bugging me throughout the meal.",1
trn_967,"Blown away by the customer service. Everything we ordered was amazing. Bacon Burger is ""really good, and very rich"". Can't go wrong with the curly fries either. The berry Mimosa is out of this world! I had the Pound Puppy Hot Dog, smothered in homemade Chili and Cheese. The Chili is some of the best restaurant chili I've had. (I'm gonna need to get this recipe! LOL) the hot dog is SO GOOD. Never had one as good, and I grew up going to dodger games. Outside of the dodger dog...this. This is the dog. Along with the friendly staff, low key environment, this made for a lovely lunch date for two.",1
trn_968,"We ate here the other night. There was no wait at 6:30 and we sat right away. Our server was very nice and did a great job, the food just was not very good.

The spinach dip appetizer was not what we expected. The menu said tortilla chips, but the chips were almost like fried pita bread or they use flour instead of corn tortillas. The chips were chewy and greasy. We almost wanted to ask the manager to come out and try some of the dish and see what he would say. 

The fried fish plate was big, but somewhat on the salty side. The breading on the shrimp and oysters overpowered the flavor and texture of the seafood. 

We were disappointed with the food and will not return.",-1

trn_972,"The hotel itself it quite nice. My room was nice, although the balcony overlooked one of the annex buildings, which is where the storage area is and the staff gets their cleaning supplies. etc. So, I could really not enjoy the balcony at all. 

My main problem is this: I booked my room through Vegas.com, for a very reasonable price. Little did I know that there would be hidden fees, such as a 25 or so per day ""resort fee"". What?! It was way too cold to even enjoy anything in the resort. I did not appreciate this.

This was my first time here, and I would have totally come back (I come to Vegas quite a bit), had it not been for this sneaky practice of adding these fees. Plenty of hotels to choose from in Vegas, though. They lost my busniness.",-1
trn_973,"Huge waste of money and time.

I should have checked Yelp before I came here. If I could give this place negative stars, I would. 
$65 later, I had to go home and detail the car myself. 

Victor was a nice guy, but I didn't spend that much money to have a nice conversation and still have a dirty car. 

While the pamphlet said $5 and up for pet hair, they charged a minimum of $50 just for the pet hair removal, and $14 for the wash. 

The car was still covered in dirt inside and out, and the floor mats looked like they hadn't even been touched. 

I will never be back, and I suggest reading these reviews before you consider coming here. Especially if you have pets.",-1
trn_974,"One of the crappier Marriotts I've ever stayed at. The staff is nice and professional enough. But the fact that it's right by the frontage road along I-17, you tend to attract a seedier crowd. Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don't even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can't afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again.",-1

The restaurant is very spacious, I have never had to wait for a seat when I came. The service is super fast, I've always gotten my orders within 5 minutes of ordering. They have a very simple menu of noodles soup, lo mein or just soup with no noodles. You can choose the type of noodles you want, and either wonton, beef, or fish, or a combination of those. And everything on their menu is under $7!!

If you like spicy food, try adding some of their spicy sauce to the noodle. I love the added flavour! However, be aware that the sauce is very spicy, so don't overdo it!",1

I came here for the first time on a Friday night. It was a good mix of young and middle-aged, locals and non-locals. There is so much going on here. You go in, get a drink from the bar, and partake in whatever floats your boat.

There's live music going on in the backyard, along with some games like life-sized beer pong, corn hole, life-sized Jenga, etc. Inside you'll find a foosball table, pool, darts, shuffleboard, connect four and many other games that I may have missed.

Boytoy was right when he said this place is like an adult daycare.",0

For 3.50 you get a burrito sized spring roll that is filling enough in itself! My favorite is the chicken.

This place has one of the more extensive nishonshu  (Sake) menus in town, but be prepared to pay a premium for it-- even during happy hour, a small wine glass (~2oz) of lower-grade sake runs $5. Additionally, a more traditional sake cup, rather than a wine glass would have been a nice touch. However, the small plate menu is closer to a true izakaya-style (tapas) restaurant, with good variety and quality. The chicken kushiyaki were juicy and flavorful, and grilled to perfection. The oshinko (pickled vegetables) weren't bad, but a few were overly-sweet.

She actually told me that I wasn't sick enough to go and see a doctor there and turned me away on a Saturday afternoon. Not even close to 5. Then they gave me a z-pack for something that I needed antibiotics . Not to put down nurses but apparently she missed this. When I called to try to get another prescription it was wait let me see if I could get that approved. I had already paid $159 for nothing.

This probably isn't real Mexican food, but who cares. You like Panda Express, don't you? You can't go wrong with the tacos, tostadas, and buttered tortillas. Don't forget to stock up the salsa. It's amazing. I've seen people fight to the death for this stuff. Really.",1

trn_1007,"I have no idea why this place gets close to a five star rating.  I went there tonight because of the rating on Yelp, and I must say, it is one step above Panda Express.

As a Chinese restaurant, I expected to be able to order Lo Mein.  Nope, don't have that.  How about hot tea?  Nope, no hot tea.  The fortune cookie comes with your meal because, guess what, you paid for your meal before you received it, so the transaction is over, here's your fortune cookie.

The take-away lesson here is:  don't rely on the star rating alone; read the reviews.

The food here was incredibly average and not incredibly cheap.  I probably will never return to this restaurant.",0

At 8:30 a.m. on a Saturday, the line was about 12 people deep, but it moved fairly quickly. Order at the counter and wait for your food. 

I got 3 different sammys: sausage, bacon and egg salad. The sandwiches were all solid and I like the arugula to give it some veg action.

Overall, nothing special -- stuff I can easily make at home. But it's one of the cheaper options inside Cosmo. Or, you can cross the street and go to McD's for a sausage egg mcmuffin -- that would satisfy a similar craving.",0

trn_1011,"As others have noted, it's not a fair, it's a carnival.  I've always imagined State Fairs to be where people from the actual State get together and show off their produce, have pie contents, biggest pig, biggest tomato, talent contest, etc...  This is a bunch of private creepy carnival companies coming to town and milking you for everything you're worth.

The games are stupid.  They're designed for you to lose, but so you don't feel bad, if you pay enough, most will guarantee a stuffed toy.  I'm sorry, if I want a guaranteed stuffed animal, I'll go to the store and pay market value for it.  

Then they have their tricky ticket system, $5 get you 10 tickets, $20 gets you 40. So there's no benefit to buying bulk.  Each game is 7-10 tickets, and it's usually for only one try.  So you're literally paying $5 to try to throw a single ball into a random basket.  But you feel better because it's tickets instead of money, so you do it. 

The photo booths don't work, but they refuse to put ""out of order"" signs on them.  So we spent 20 minutes on a bunch of different booths that didn't work before getting our money back and leaving.  

The food is probably the worst part.  Not only is it ridiculous prices, but it's also not food any more.  Fried burritos, fried burgers, fried ANYTHING.  There are places where you can't take a breath without getting a lung-full of fried.  

The only good part was the Ferris wheel",-1

It's Arby's, so either you like it or not. As for me, I will take a pass for future lunch decisions.  There really is not much quality in this market.  But, if I have to have fast food, you can do worse then  Arby's.  On a positive note, Arby's usually get my order correct  and they offer some not to greasy options.  I particularly like the beef and cheddar, which is a little better than most offering as a drive through.  

The beef and cheddar sandwich was hot and fresh and what you would  expect  from an Arby's. However, my fries were  cold,  tasteless, an old as if they've were sitting there for quite a while

I called back, got transferred to the manager who said ""come in no problem"". 
We came in (the next day) and got the run around from frantic employees who God forbid something be made right over $5 (supposedly the upcharge). 
We specifically asked for this. If your employees don't speak well enough English, that is not a patron issue. 
They had RUDE attitudes & were VERY snippy in conversation. 
Mind you I just dropped $100 here 24 hours prior.

They had to call the manager back and I had to get BACK on the phone with her for her to ""cover $5"" for ONE pedicure. Get the flip out of here lmao

I and the blue corn tamale which was ok but the taste of the tamale got lost in the spicy sauce. However the same cannot be said for the pork rib plate, a house specialty. It was spicy but excellent.

The service is helpful and is seeming never bothered by special requests. in fact, they seem eager to meet the challenge.
I ordered a variety of meals here over the years but my favorite is the salmon ceasar salad. I order it every time I stay in Vegas.  Upon my request the salmon is grilled to perfection.

The outdoor patio with stylish furniture and yummy looking menu drew us in -  however looks can be deceiving :(

The patio cushions were dirty and stained all over...and the food was not nearly as delicious as we had hoped for. 

Boyfriend had fixed price option with the sauteed chicken breast (very buttery/greasy and bland) I had the Penne All' Arrabbiata which was mildly better but I found it was overwhelmed by the chilli flakes. I understand it is supposed to be a spicy dish - but it shouldn't just take like chilli-flake pasta.

A positive about my experience?  The service. Though a bit slow at times, the servers were attentive and genuinely friendly. 

Another positive?  If they would spring for new patio cushions  their patio would be a really nice place to have a drink on a summer afternoon or evening.

The place is fairly small and mostly full already. Attentiveness of servers are poor, we didn't get serve until after awhile of impatient waiting. Seems to me that they are under staffed when they know that it is usually busy.

We wanted to order mango tango which was mangi flavored, but they are out of stock until the end kf the month which is 3wks later. So we ordered a green wizard ice cream which was green tea ice cream, red bean, grass jelly, tapioca and condensed milk. Trying it for the first time, it wasn't disappointing at all, in fact it was very good. We also ordered a roasted rice green milk tea which wasn't rich in flavor and tasted like a powdered drink. 

The place is clean and comfortable to sit to grab desserts or drinks or even to do some catching up with friends. I would recommend getting their ice cream and is the only thing I am looking forward in coming back to to try other flavors. Their drinks wasn't too satisfying and service was disappointing.",0

trn_1029,I've been visiting this dentist for almost 10 years. I actually go from California to Las Vegas to get treated every year. I can't trust anyone else with my teeth. Dr. Alemi is very kind and I find him to be very trustworthy. He is always honest and communicates and educates me a lot on my teeth. His staff is also very present and kind and the clinic is always clean. I trust him more than I could trust anyone else with my teeth! He tries to be very flexible and accommodating!,1

We came here to grab dinner upon a coworkers recommendation.
We were seated and the first thing we noticed was that the AC was out in the building. Now in Vegas during the summer this is not the situation you want to be in, but we were already in too deep. Our server was great and gave us options the entire time. 
Now I would give this a 5 Star if this review was for their menu design because it was amazing. However, this is of their food which was not. The noodles were bland and the sauce was not flavorful.",0

trn_1034,"I am literally leaving this place as I take the time to write this review. This was one of the worse dining experience which is sad because Cheesecake Factory is my favorite restaurant in the USA. 

My partner and I were ready for the long anticipated wait (we read the reviews beforehand and expected to wait approximately 2 hours) so we went for dinner a little later (around 9:00 PM). When we got here we got led around because there was a line to just get a buzzer (which mind you went by fast). As we got to the buzzer counter the lady said the wait time was 1 hr (which got us exited cause we expected to wait longer). But 1.5 hours go by and we were still not buzzed so we went to inquire. The lady said 15-20 mins more which totaled to 2 hrs before we were buzzed in. Then we waited just a lil more to be seated. We had ample time to look at the menu so we ordered our entrees right away. Having been to this franchise multiple times in many states I chose to get my regular dish: the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. Of course the time it took to prepare it was understandable (20 mins approximately) and 2.5 hours later we finally get served our dishes. 

My pasta looked great but when I took my first bite I was utterly disgusted. The pasta was overcooked and it tasted like dough. The shrimp and chicken was cooked right but the pasta was off. I took a couple of bites to make sure and my partner agreed it was off (the pasta was overcooked). It tasted like I was eating dough so I had to return it and chose to just get another faster dish (cause I did not want to wait another 20 mins). I decided to get the baja chicken tacos.  That ended up taking another 20 mins To arrive! In between the management came to apologize to us about our dish which I thought was nice but it was pointless considering we were still charged for the pasta and the tacos. I had to send the receipt back again to get the pasta removed (which they erased as a ""comp serv""). I'm surprised I managed to keep my cool the entire night. This place is a mess. The food was not worth the wait. I felt bad for our server cause he had to run back and forth cause the kitchen or management kept screwing up. The service was wonderful but I can't blame the workers for the mess this restaurant is. 

I waited 3.5 hours to just eat! And I seriously lost my appetite by then. It would have been faster if they had not screwed up and made me wait an additional hour. I am very disappointed in this restaurant. 

You have tainted the experience for me. This is my favorite restaurant in the states and I can't believe I will never be stepping into his one again. I rather drive to the border than dine here.   

I do want to add that we did end up getting the Tuxedo cheesecake and it was delicious! The only thing about the night that gave it some light.  

Don't fall for the hype. If you want some cheesecake just order it to go. I hope they 
will be able to live up to their reputation cause so far it's not looking good.",-1
trn_1035,"I wouldn't even give this place half a star!!

The food was over priced and disgusting. We should have went to Taco Bell or Filibertos.

There were COCKROACHES crawling all over the walls and booths.
We complained to an employee who did nothing to resolve the situation or even try and kill the cockroaches,  he just let them continue crawling around the walls and booths!!

I'm absolutely disgusted and will never ever return to this establishment.

This place needs to be cleaned!! The booth we sat in had left over food in it!!

So gross!!",-1
trn_1036,"Formerly Dong Ting Spring. No more pots on the menu but still lots of great Hunan style food here. As vegetarians, my husband and I ordered the spicy sting beans (amazing), sweet and pungent potato (meh) and the seaweed salad (solid). If you want spicy, ask for it.

As a side note, both staff and other patrons commented on the fact that we (both white) were successfully using chopsticks. Guess they don't see a lot of that in here.",1
trn_1037,"Small, quaint corner restaurant with a lot of charm. Small counter space with a few tables do not discourage the wait for home style food. Breakfast and brunch are cash only, but so what, it's worth it. Assortment of egg dishes and various pancakes with a nice raspberry ice tea are a highlight. The brunch menu offered their own specialties, but we were only two people so we didn't sample them. Attentive, friendly wait staff made sure your cup is always filled. Quirky fun decor. Not good for large groups. Points for anyone who can identify the error with the New York mirror scene. Check out the local antique stores for some oddities.",1

I've been here a few times since it opened and I absolutely loved the place, food and service.
The decor, the music and the food is something I really connect to and hence the rating.
The chicken Thali is what I've ordered when I've been here.
They give you a paapad, 2 curries, one naan, a small bowl of rice and a sweet.
I love the fact that the quantity fills me just about right and I leave feeling not heavy but content.
The first time I ordered the Thali, the entrees (curries) were fantastic and the second time, one of them was alright.
I will be visiting this place again and recommend it to friends who like Indian food.",1

trn_1041,"This is a great place; It is true that the choices for Indian are quite limited in the north and west valley.  This one still makes the cut.  We get take-out here at least twice a month and it is really good.

As the earlier reviews said, the buffet should be avoided, but this is true of mostly all buffets.  There is simply no comparison between mass-market food sitting on steam tables and the dinner dishes prepared to order.

It's a definite ""must stop in"" if you're on your way through or live in the west valley and you have a craving for Indian food.",1

Car rentals are new experience for me. I didn't realize how big of a deal it is to take a car from one location and drop it off at another. I'm upset that this wasn't  clearly stated especially for somebody that has no experience renting cars. They should take a little more time with that person just to make things clear. It ended up costing me almost double what I was supposed to pay to drop the car off at a different airport. That's what you get for going cheap so next time I'll pay a little bit more and hope for a better experience.",-1
trn_1044,"The TL;DR version: If Dr. Marcelo leaves, we will follow her or go to a different practice. She's 5 stars, the office and Dr. Pham are 1 star. Maybe 2 if I'm being generous. 

We've been bringing our children to this office for almost three years now. I have mixed feelings about the office, and if I were a first time parent, knowing what I know now I would likely go elsewhere. However we are established here with our children, and I do generally like Dr Marcelo, so we will keep coming here pretty much only for her.

Cons:
-Almost always running behind. We usually wait a long time between the waiting room and exam room. I am always a few minutes early, so it's frustrating to wait for so long.
-Dr. Pham's breastfeeding advice is TERRIBLE. Do not listen to his breastfeeding advice. He told me not to feed my newborn more than every two hours! I was a first time parent and didn't know better. Clearly he has no education on breastfeeding- feeding ON DEMAND is paramount to a healthy breastfeeding relationship and milk supply. Also, cluster feeding is normal, healthy, and though sometimes hard for mama, it's very important for milk supply. We listened to his shitty advice, my son was always crying and wanting to nurse, but we tried to hold him off. My son ended up not gaining enough and then we had to come back a week later for a weight check- I fed on demand between those appointments and he gained a pound in a week. This is where I learned that doctors aren't these all powerful, all knowing beings. He has no business giving breastfeeding advice what so ever. We won't see him.
-The referrals process is SLOW. My second son needed to see a specialist. It took them over three weeks to refer him, and I even called and told them who the only provider in network for us was, yet they STILL tried other providers first?! They also didn't send a referral to the office or any information like they claimed they did, the specialist's office had to call for it. These delays meant our son had to have a more invasive procedure because he missed the window for the endoscopic version as he was now too old- we would have liked to have had both options to consider. 
-The medical assistants seem to always botch getting height. The lines they make for head and feet never line up, and then they measure on a diagonal, so the height is never accurate. This leads to infants going from taller to shorter, or no change between appointments and then the providers worry when really nothing is wrong.

Pro:
-Dr. Marcelo is wonderful, very knowledgeable and intelligent. She has good bedside manner. She noticed early on a deformity that our second son had, which from my understanding is frequently missed by pediatricians. We really like her, and will keep taking our kids to Surprise Peds only because she is a great doctor, and she is familiar with our kids. She also remembers us, even though we really only come for well checks. Every time I have seen her outside of Surprise Peds she says hi to me.",0
trn_1045,"Disappointing. We are new to the area and our friends have mentioned this place to us. My husband and I came for the NYE party - what a mistake. The guy at the door had an attitude from the start. The buffet consisted of bland tasting food and fruit that wasn't fully ripe. The chicken at the buffet was mushy.....how do you get mushy chicken? We paid for a table for 4. When it was time to bring out the champagne, the staff tried to only give us 1 bottle, instead of the 2 we paid for. When we asked for the 2nd bottle, they brought out a bottle of Andre's. Really? I could have spend the $10 at the store and bought that myself. The couple at the next table complained about the service as well - they were only brought 1 bottle and paid for 2. This was no where near worth the $170 that we paid and will never come back. The only good thing about the place....the upper level bartenders were polite and had good customer service.",-1

Not really a shareable portion either. Other places you get unlimited banchan/side dishes but here you only get two with your meal & an extra side dish is 2$ each ! I have no complaints about quality of the food though & food comes out fast for made to order place. I don't think I have ordered anything I did not like besides the meat jun (way too much egg for me).

Been here a few times for business occasions and once or twice on my own. 
I really like the Martini situation here, obviously one might guess by their name (a neat play on words we have seen before) that they have a special play in that vein. Last I was there, they had somewhere around 40 or so on their Martini Time menu. They also feature Sangria, Mojitos and Margaritas. I stick with the less complicated and more classic style myself.

I see many folks, and regulars who congregate here, filling the bar high-tops and booths after work to socialize over a drink or two. 


But beyond the libations, I also enjoy dinner here. Last time there I enjoyed a meal of Grilled Salmon --white cheddar risotto, asparagus and a blackberry port wine reduction..... This was just Delicious. The Salmon was cooked just perfect medium rare to medium. This was melt in your mouth tender and juicy with superb salmon taste. The cheddar risotto was incredibly rich and perfectly done. With the blackberry reductions the complexity of flavors in the mouth was very rewarding. Also I cannot fail to mention how outstanding the asparagus was. Again just perfectly cooked to allow the flavors to breakout in you mouth. Boy, I would get meal this again.

Flavor, atmosphere, and price are all winners here.",1
trn_1056,"Another great ""mini"" hotel located in the Mandalay Bay resort.  

Oddly enough, I've had the opportunity to stay at both THEhotel and the Four Seasons here, but not at Mandalay Bay itself. I am not anxious, however, to remedy that.  One of the disadvantages of large hotels is dealing with the crowds. No, thank you. I'm already going to have to deal with it when I go out or go shopping, and I dont want to subject myself to that any more than necessary.

This hotel consists of all suites, decorated in a darker, modern palette of browns and creams.  I stayed in a one bedroom suite; there was a king bed in the bedroom and a spacious living area.  

There is a restaurant in the lobby (dont recall the name), that serves brunch, lunch, and dinner.  The hotel uses the same Mandalay Bay pool area, which was a bit of a dissapointment. I had hoped that (like the Four Seasons), that THEhotel would have its own, separate pool area. Just another way to feel exclusive =).

THEhotel is definitely a younger, sexier counterpart to the more elegant Four Seasons located nearby.  I would recommend either of these places over Mandalay Bay itself.",1

Right downtown within walking distance of many restaurants and bars and Blue Jays Stadium.  Despite it's central location, it's quiet and you can get a good night's rest.  There is free breakfast every morning with very good sausage, muffins, cereal, pancakes, etc.  The only downfall is the powdered eggs.  I also appreciated the ice water with oranges and lemons in the lobby.  The rooms are clean and pretty spacious. This was kind of a budget trip for me and my girlfriends so we stayed in a room with a king size bed and a pull out couch.  We had lots of clothes and toiletries but weren't cramped.  There was a full size fridge and microwave and an electric stove with 2 burners. Oh and also a small dishwasher.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The hotel was definitely booked up for the weekend as the Caribana festival was happening and it was a holiday weekend in Ontario, but the staff was still very accomodating.  I would definitely return to this hotel if I get back to Toronto.",1

My family and I dropped by today because we had the $5 for $10 Groupon. I wasn't impressed that two dispensers didn't have any frozen yogurt. So there weren't as many options to choose from. There were two new flavours that I haven't tried before which were the frozen hot chocolate and Nutella. There were plenty of toppings to add to our frozen yogurt which is a plus in my books. When we cashed out we had to pay taxes on our Groupon which was 65 cents ($1.30 for both Groupons). 

I don't tend to go to Menchies since I'm usually not in the area and there are so many other places closer to me. However, if there's a Groupon deal then that's when I'll visit Menchies. Hopefully next time all of their dispensers will have fro yo in it.",0

I came to this practice a year ago for a cleaning and exam as a new patient. Confirming my appointment was a nightmare, and they gave me the wrong arrival time but that's forgivable. 
I was pregnant at the time of my appointment and unable to take x-rays and so they took pictures of my teeth instead. They proceeded to tell me that I had NINE cavities, 9...let that sink in for a moment, and presented me with a quote of over $2,000 and asked me when I wanted to book my appointment for the fillings. Something felt off, maybe it was the fact that I KNEW I didn't go from 0 cavities to 9 in 6 months from my last appointment so I left and never rescheduled. I decided to wait to see another dentist until after I had the baby so I could get x-rays done. I found a new dentist near my house and went this week and had ZERO cavities. He couldn't believe another office would've told me I had 9 and what a scam that was. I think his exact words were ""if you're going to try to scam people, at least give them a more realistic number, like 2 or 3.""

I love the balyage as well. Nikki really listened to what I wanted and then made it happen. I get compliments on it constantly!  Looking forward to my next visit!",1
trn_1074,"Simply outstanding! Mr. Fieri has proven himself once again as being this nations's premier chef. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all exceptionally good.

1) The ""Honkey Tonkey Double McBurger Blaster"" was phenomenal. The two beef patties were masterfully placed between two artisan created pieces of toast. Accompanying this sandwich was Guy's Ragin Flamin' splooge sauce that added subtle notes of hickory and leather.

2) ""Guy's Mozzarella Sticks"" were truly out of this world...possibly in the next universe. White cheese resembling mozzarella was delicately coated with a bread crumble that Guy calls Pano de coto. Simply outsanding!

3) ""Le Chicken Dubenaise"" was the star! A fully cooked chicken was presented table side and the waiter sliced each piece to your liking. It was then served with the most delicious Dubenaise sauce I have ever had.

This is THE destination restaurant on the strip.",1
trn_1075,They have 152 different pinball machines from classic woodrails to brand new releases like Stern's Ghostbusters. We spent 2 hours playing and had a blast. Games are priced great too - they aren't trying to charge a dollar for a play. I'm so glad we went. We got to play a ton of classics that I've always wanted to try. If you like pinball you can't miss this!,1
trn_1076,"Every time I eat here I am never disappointed. The food is delicious, the staff are friendly, and overall is always a great experience. Their house specialty, the shaken beef, is an absolute must to try. Definitely give Saigon Kitchen a visit if you're in the neighborhood.",1

trn_1078,"I wish I could give this place 0 star rating, but unfortunately I don't have that option. After months of this place being on my list of places to try I finally had the chance today. First of all this place is buried so deep on campus it took forever to actually find it even after asking 3 officials. We had to pay 3$ for parking and after walking to its location we realized it was closed.. even though YELP showed it was open, google maps showed it was open, and google internet showed it was open. Wasted my time and my money for nothing. I will never even attempt to go to this place again. I'll stick with TED's!",-1

When I got my vehicle back, not only did my truck not blow cold air but I got it back with a broken fan switch. I then went to LEROY'S AUTO and what a difference! My ac now blows colder than it ever did! They showed me that BRAKES PLUS actually never evacuated my ac system and because of this they overcharged my system with freon. Save yourself the time and money and go to the people who can do it right the first time. Thank you Leroy's! P.s. they know Ford trucks inside and out and love to work on them.",1

So I walk in and there's about a handful of people working there and there was a girl up front on multiple lines. Everyone else was just sitting there, one guy was laughing it up with 2 women. This poor girl up front was on multiple lines, greeted me, and the girl who came in after. 

Her customer service was impeccable and genuine! For someone running the whole thing and everyone else just twiddling their thumbs, she had grand customer service and a comforting voice. I believe her name was JULIA. THANKS JULIA",1

I've never had a bad experience at this place before.",-1

I think when you are not distracted by everything around you, the food tastes a lot better! I definitely gained a new appreciation for the blind after this experience.

trn_1091,The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake.,-1
trn_1092,We stopped in on a Sunday morning so had no trouble with wait times. Our server was pleasant but a bit distant. Drinks were served promptly but the food took about 20 minutes. Had the breakfast burrito which was very good - the chips that came with the dish were really good. Would have rated 5 stars if the server was more friendly. Would like to come back and try some of the other menu offerings. Warning - Huge servings on everything we saw.,1

trn_1096,"After reading so many lukewarm reviews I was a little hesitant to try this restaurant but I had a $25 food credit for staying at the Linq and they honoured it so that made my decision for me.
I was dining alone so was able to skip the 35 minute projected wait and sat at the bar which is open seating. My server was really friendly and had me set up with a cool glass of water and a menu as soon as I sat down. I had been eating poorly the last few days so decided to go with the appetiser Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Holy crap this dish was HUGE and so delicious! The chicken was tender, the mince was delicious and the sauces were all different and blended in perfectly with the mint leaves and other Asian influenced herbs that were in the dish. Definitely not what I was expecting, I thought I might have to order more before I saw how big the serving was. I also got a Cucumber cross Watermelon Cocktail which was super refreshing. Food was reasonably priced and I wish I was here with a few more people so I could return and try some more things on the menu!
Definitely check this restaurant out... but sit at the bar.",1

Service was really good, coffee was delicious, we ordered a couple of plates and shared.  My highlight was white mac and cheese with charred radicchio and pecan gremolata with an egg over easy flopped in the middle! The grits were some of the best grits, I've ever had in a restaurant. Super fattening, the way grits should be and salted correctly.   Count me in!! 

It has such a good vibe, the owners are there and it seems like a friendly, family work environment, it shines through with the service and food.",1

The football game was so loud we could not hear the conversation and when I asked to move the waitress thru a hissy fit. The wait staff move our water glasses and were very nice. The T-bone was cooked perfectly and came with a very small side of string potatoes for $42. The risotto with three shrimp and was so salty it was not good. Coffee was great. The waitress was rude again when we were taking care of the bill. When you pay over $100 for two meals good service is a must.,-1

I eat here whenever im tired of eating the same ol regular lunch from around the way. This place isnt far and yes it is convenient, but for 15 bucks? Every now and then doesn't hurt.

The original location is better",-1
trn_1106,"A real treasure in the city of Phoenix, I discovered the place through a Google search and thought I'd try them out, that was about 3 years ago and I still use them to this day. The place is hidden in what I would call a warehouse district, and you can miss it if you aren't careful, even when you find the right back road that goes past it, you may want to use a GPS or use an online map to find it. Once you do you'll find a building that is quite obviously used to house spices for wholesale, it has a small store section where customers can walk in and purchase. 

There is nothing fancy here, just bins in alphabetical order with pretty much any spice you can think of, at least out of the common ones. Everything is packed in plastic bags so they can keep their cost down and pass it on to you which is no biggie if you have spice containers to store the stuff when you get home. Most things are sold in 1lb bulk, though the more expensive spices are sometimes sold in small weight sizes. You can even purchase bigger bulk bags if you wish, but I'm more familiar with the smaller bulk sizes of 1lb. Everything is fresh, and you often have a choice between whole spices and ground, they even have special blends of spices for specific things such as ranch, chorizo, or taco seasoning. The prices are extremely affordable too, the cheapest I've seen, that is for sure.

To put it in perspective I bought 1lb bags each of chili powder hot, chili powder mild, mustard powder, MSG, cumin (whole), and granulated garlic, all for  $23. Be warned though it is only cash or check, they do not accept credit or debit. Considering the low prices I'm willing to deal with it.",1
trn_1107,"Applebee's just underwent a major revamp of the menu so I thought this would be a good time to update my review. The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse. 
I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender. Service was friendly and snappy. 
Overall, the meal was a great value. I just question whether the Valley needs yet another steakhouse chain.",1
trn_1108,"Good place to try some specialty burger meat patties. The meat patties were quite unique. My friend and I both enjoyed trying something different than what we're accustomed to.

Food: 
Had their preset burgers since it was my first time there and I didn't know what combination would taste best. I was a bit disappointed. It tasted good but didn't have the wow factor for the combination. Portion was a bit small for the price, it would have been nice if there we're some small sides included.

Service:
Great! They explained the menu to us and the waitress recommended a few things to us based on what we were in the mood for.

Decor:
Some unique items sprinkled on the walls.  Overall nice but the tables were a bit too close together for my liking. I didn't feel like I had privacy as the table next to us would be able to hear us clearly.

I think that we might have overpaid for the oil change with Pep Boys cause I got an email from Honda West for an oil change for $29.95 which I believe I was overcharged quite a bit even though I got $15.00 off using my Pep Boys Rewards card.

That was my favorite part--I had a lot to look at, and I ended up filling my shopping cart (and I never use shopping carts at thrift stores, but the goods kept piling on).

trn_1126,"I saw the Heart Attack Grill on television and knew they had scantily clad nurses and lard induced food. What you don't realize is the restaurant is really going for more than the lard version of Hooters.  They want to give you the feeling that you are eating in a strip club.  By that, I'm not suggesting that the nurses are inappropriate or wearing too little clothing. It's just that you walk in and they have long tables shaped like a bar with stools. It's like a cheap inside joke, they are TRYING to be the ultimate guys hangout: lard burgers and fries, waitresses who are dressed like stripper nurses, no veggies, no diet coke,  all the lard drenched steak fries you can eat, corona's and regular coke served in bottles.  

Yeah, I'm fine with all of that and I understand this place is going for that theme. 

So in short, the concept is fun but the execution is horrible. Here are the problems

1. Food: the burgers tasted as if they went to Food City and bought the cheapest meat they could buy and dump it in some lard. The lard didn't not make the food taste any different with the exception that I felt really full and heavy at the end of my meal. The food was very disappointing. 

2. Scantilly clad women in nurses outfits are fine as long as the women wearing the outfits are attractive. That wasn't the case here. They are not even Hooters quality in terms of attractiveness.

3. Yes, I want greasy food but I don't want to feel like I'm standing next to the fryer as I eat the food. The floor had so much grease that had condensed from the air that I almost slipped several times. The place had a bad odor and it just stank from the lard. You felt like you were eating in the kitchen.

4. Lack of service: the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they don't serve you. It's like Fudruckers. You get your own fries. You put toppings on your own burger. You fill out your own order/check at the end. The waitress only takes your drink order and points to a wall and aks you to pick out a burger

5. Scary crowd: the people eating at the restaurant reminded me of people on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We are talking major rednecks here!  It was mostly middle aged guys sitting by themselves and eating as if they were at a strip club I also saw a bunch of kids eat here and they looked as if they running moonshine between Kentucky and Ohio in the 1920's.

6. No credit cards.  They have an ATM in the place if you lack cash

7. Expensive.  I paid 14 dollars for a beer and a burger.  For the cheap a$#$ environment, you woud think the prices would be less but you",-1
trn_1127,"Great food!     Came here with the Family for a birthday dinner.    It was a lovely evening.

We will definitely go back!!",1
trn_1128,I'm really digging this place. Have gone a few times now. Lots of cool rolls to chose from and really pretty presentation. The sashimi comes in an ice packed oversized martini glass. Also had  live jazz. Always enjoy a place where the chefs are having fun. Lots of toasting and laughing. Nice place to hang with your friends. Prices reasonable. Its can get a bit loud when the bands going. Not a bad place to bring kids since there is so much going on and you don't have to worry about their noise so much. Also awesome giant tvs everywhere so you can watch events. Would be a fun place to throw a party.,1

trn_1133,"I've been here a few times and its always been amazing even if you aren't into coffee drinks like me. A great summer drink is their watermelon lemonade, I also really like their hot chocolate. The staff are always friendly and you can't beat the view of the city from there.",1
trn_1134,"Ended up here because the place we were planning on was packed, and we were getting seriously hangry after a long plane ride and rush hour taxi ride into town. 

So, the burgers. I admit, I was a little scared when they arrived. The patties are the softball type - much smaller diameter then the bun, and very thick, which is not my preferred style. But, it turned out to be pretty tasty. The meat had a good char on it, and was well seasoned. After the first couple of bites, the patty squishes out to the edges, so you don't have that thing where you're left with a bunch of plain white bread at the end. They were also generous with the bacon on the bacon cheeseburger. 

I liked that the burgers came with both salad and a side. The fries were disappointing, though- underfried, so soggy and a little greasy. 

All in all I was happy with the meal. The burger was surprisingly good, but points off for the soggy fries and the pricing, which I thought was a little high for what you get.",0
trn_1135,"I have to say that while I previously was very much a fan of this business, I have lost any and all positive opinion of this company.  When I first signed up with Human and Rightsource, someone went over all the medications in my profile.  I was informed that because of my coverage, I would receive my insulins and other diabetic supplies with a zero dollar co-pay.  I had been previously going through Rite Aid for my meds.  When I called RightSource today, I was now told that I would need to pay OVER a $500 copay!  Now WHY, has it changed????  When I posed this question, I was told that they had never told me my insulins for free.  Why the he** would I make this up, as it was implied?  After I had told them about the4 lack of a copay, the person I spoke to became very condescending.  When this person would not even check my file again, I said ""You know what?  I will go elsewhere then!"" and I hung up the phone due to the fact that I was way past livid and was ready to explode at that point.  If I kept this prescription and my other insulin, Lantus Solostar, at RiteAid it is still reasonable.  I only wanted these 2 medications filled by RightSource because, as I mentioned above, I was told that it would be a zero copay.  

Another 'interesting' occurrence is that when I went to sign in, I was immediately shown a message that said I had exceeded my attempts to sign in.  WTF??? This was the first time in months that I had tried to access my information on this site.  I do not know what happened to this site or this company, but it is a H-U-G-E decline in worth and is really not worth the paper that a regular prescription is printed on.  I am incredibly disappointed with this situation.",-1

Most Dentists are mainly out to charge your insurance for whatever they can well this one the front desk is soo incompetent they don't even know how to change your insurance... she asked me how many periodontal units were covered as she flustered through trying to operate a pc... the dentist Dr Sekon seemed ok advice to the dr. hire staff that understand customer service who won't stick you with a bill on the way out and say well were direct billing just as a favour to you when the advertise as a direct bill clinic on all the flyers.... horrible service buyer beware you may be stuck with an invoice due to their incompetence with technology...,-1
trn_1139,"Hi guys, went back to DC sound about 4 months ago this time to get my stock speakers changed out on my 2015 Silverado to DD Audio and also a DD audio 12"" shallow mount subwoofer .They also found a subwoofer box for me online and put it under the rear seats with no modification to the truck. Drove it around a few days but didn't like the sound of the subwoofer for the money I spent. I called Carlos and he was more then happy to get it right. This time around they made me a custom subwoofer box and changed out my single 5 channel amp to two amps for more power to the subwoofer. I was very pleased this time around for having 1 12"" sub. Sounds good and has good quality. My truck still looks all stock they did a great job, you get what you pay for. Thanks to the guys at DC sound yet once again, they really take the time out and getting it they way you want it. So if your in need of some good quality sounds with a great warranty you should stop by and at least check them out.",1
trn_1140,"My first time being in a beach club and I had no idea what to expect.  My bf and I were first in line because I wanted to make sure that we got a place to sit (I anticipated that this place would get super packed) and a locker to store our essential personal items.  

Things to note.. 
1) Renting a locker cost $75.  Alesso was the dj that day so the prices must've been jacked up.  Needless to say, this was worth the money because once the place gets packed with hundreds of people, it's tough to find your things and having a place to store your wallet, cellphone, change of clothes, and other items was worth the peace of mind.  
2) Even though it does not say it on the prohibited list of items.. DO NOT bring sunblock lotion.  They will confiscate it.  You are allowed the sprays though.  Additionally, if you forget to bring or get yours confiscated.. you can always buy some from the towel window or go to the bathroom and use the items in there, just make sure to tip the person 1 or 2 dollars.  
3) As expected, drinks and food are super expensive.  You're not allowed to bring anything in and there is no re-entry once you're in, so if you're going to be hanging around the pool for hours, you are bound to get hungry.  We got a hamburger, chicken fingers, and a gatorade.  Total cost: $55.  That's like one entry to a buffet?!?  Drinks on the other hand.. $65.  What?!? And the most expensive alcohol they have is like SKYY Vodka.  Good for them for really making money!  Although they are a bit heavy handed with their drinks.  I personally cannot drink alcohol if I can taste it and so to me, it tasted like drinking gasoline but everyone else around me seemed to enjoy it.
4) Seating.  I would highly recommend getting a table or a cabana with shade if you are in a big group.  The cheapest table is like $1.5K but it includes alcohol.. so if you divide that up amongst 10 of you compared to the cost of the drinks.. it might be worth the money.  Plus you have a set place to keep your stuff.   If you are like us who came just as a couple so $1.5K is just a ridiculous price to pay for two people, there are places to sit around the palm trees.  Just know that It gets so hot and there is not a lot of shade.  We were able to find a place to sit but unfortunately through the day we lost our shade and it just got hot.  We ended up spending most of the time in the pool.  
5) There's no schedule of events.  We got there at 10:30, people thought Alesso would be on at 1pm, after 1- they said 3pm. He eventually started to dj sometime between 3:30 and 4:00pm.  
6) Security: I had both a good and bad experience with them.  First the good, they actually go in the water and make sure that people are ok.  Bad: My boyfriend lost his flip flops (or someone took them) in the midst of the hundreds of people there.  I miraculously found mine-- after someone had taken it at the beginning of the day.  We asked the staff where we could buy new ones, they directed us to the shops at the Wynn.  We ended up going to the Wynn and I felt really appalled at the security staff there.  Mind you I was completely sober, but because I happened to not be staying there during this time (I am a red card member), they literally blocked our entrance to come in because my boyfriend did not have slippers (which happened while we were on their property). I tried to explain the situation and I said I could go in to buy shoes/slippers for him and my bf could wait for me outside but they were really rude and condescending (and if you know me, it takes a lot to get me upset) and would not let me in either.  Never in my life have I experienced this type of professionalism or lack there of and being in a service profession I never would've treated anyone the way I was treated.    So if you don't stay at the actual hotel, expect the security staff to be less than pleasant with you.  This problem would've been avoided if the staff would've told us to go to the mall across the street instead of directing us to the Wynn.  
7) Atmosphere: It was really nice coming in and it was empty but by 1pm it's so so crowded that i takes a long time to get  out of the pool to get drinks or go to the bathroom, so I pretty much stayed in the pool unless I really had to get out.    Everyone's pretty nice and chill but once the drinks kick it, it gets a little crazy.  There were a group of guys that kept throwing stacks of cash in the water.  Also, i met a group of people who my bf and I hung out with who were really friendly and cool.  Also, don't get intimidated that it's a pool party because you'll be out and about in your swim wear. I know I was but everyone's out to have fun and once i let that go, i had fun.

Overall, would I do this again?  Ehhh.  It was probably a once in a lifetime thing, unless I get a big group of friends to go and we get table/cabana service. I would rather chill at the pool with friends and family and have a stereo playing in the background.",-1

trn_1144,"I came here with my friend who lived in the neighbourhood and she always raved how good the gelato was at Il Gelatiere. She made it a point that it was one of the Top 10 Gelato places on blogTO. I'll be honest, I'm not sure what good gelato is. I've had gelato a bunch of times but I could never taste the difference from a low vs high quality store. 

The store is easily accessible because it's located near Eglinton station. As soon as you walk in, the cute interior design of the store put a smile on my face because of the bright colours and the sweet smell of gelato. They have a large patio right beside the store, so it makes it an awesome place to visit on a hot day. 

They have a wide selection of flavours, from fruits to desserts. Whenever I get gelato, I typically get the Tiramisu and something citrus like Grapefruit. Both of the flavours had a deep taste which I liked. I got the small cup and you can pick two flavours! I find it to be a bit pricy though.",0
trn_1145,"Really cool park. Nice green grass and playground equipment, grass volleyball and walking sidewalks.  They have lots of pet waste stations with bags and doggie water fountains but no fenced in dog park.  We found an empty patch of grass with no one near by to let our dog play fetch and the rent a cop came and yelled at us.  If they take his salary and build a dog park five stars for sure.",1
trn_1146,"This place gets my four stars mainly for being the one of the only places to catch limited release movies.  The smaller theaters can't or won't take a risk showing movies that mainstream audiences don't know about.

 I totally found out about this quirk by accident when my friends and I happened upon a poster for a movie we, like most people, hadn't heard about.  We found out that it was a two day limited release and would only be playing at the Concord Mills theater.  Long story short, I found my new favorite actor and book series (it was Death Note, for those who wanted to know).  

You really have to look for these releases though, because they have a nasty habit of not advertising them.  Apparently movie execs don't put a lot of faith in foreign movies, even though most of them have a huge cult following before they even come over.  So keep your eyes peeled and your mind open, plus it is a very nice theater.",1

trn_1148,"I moved to Vegas from California, so I was pretty familiar with Wahoo's already.
I can say that a Wahoo's with a bar/gaming area is even better!

As far as the food, it's always really on point. I almost always get a salad every time. They are super fresh, full packed, and their dressings are not only delicious, but healthy as well. I love their new Kai Kale salad. They've done a great job adding the kale and masking the bitterness of it by chopping the kale into smaller pieces and mixing it in with other greens. It's such a simple idea, but no one is doing this. If you love salad, do yourself a favor and order one of theirs. Their tofu is also really really good. I don't know if it's marinated overnight or what, but it's super flavorful. 

As far as the bar service, it can be super hit or miss. We've had some amazing bartenders here, and then some that are not so good. Michael (I think that's his name...he has a New York accent) is an amazing bartender. He's helpful with his suggestions, super super friendly, always smiling, and very attentive. The rest of the bartenders here could take a couple notes from this guy.

Unfortunately, since this place is always packed with industry regulars you might end up getting ignored for awhile because of bartender favoritism.",1

The servers were also extremely knowledgeable and attentive. They would come back periodically and ask if anything was needed. I like also how they remove the bread crumbs from your table.

The problem when our group of five went was the fact that they were having some big gathering upstairs and so the kitchen was awfully busy - not slow as you could see a lot of food going upstairs just way too busy and our food took over an hour to come and that was for lunch! To their credit even though the kitchen must have been going on overdrive, all the food came out consistently good.

So call them I did, I ordered the tom kha soup, a green curry, pad thai and coconut rice.You have your choice of what meat (or no meat) you want to add to each of the dishes. I went for all chicken.

I enjoyed everything immensely! Though my husband said I was feeding him 'milky soup with twigs in it'. I told him that is just the lemongrass and thai basil.

trn_1180,"My review is really closer to a 3.5 and is for grooming services only. I bought a $32 Groupon for a dog bath and de-shedding for a dog of any size to use at Just Like Home Doggie Hotel & Grooming. As an owner of a almost 70 pound Siberian Husky, that was music to my ears. My husband dropped off our dog Thor around 8AM. Apparently he loved his encounter with Just Like Home. He enthusiastically told me about their boarding services ($35/night), their military discount, and their high-tech video cameras allowing pet owners to see their dogs while they're away. I received a call from Just Like Home around 1PM letting me know Thor was ready to be picked up. It's important to note that pet owners have an hour window to pick up their animals after being notified or Just Like Home will penalize you with a $15 fee every 15 minutes that you're late. I thought that was kind of ridiculous.  

My first impression of this establishment was it was 'different'. It looks like it was previously a home converted into a doggie day care. Upon walking in, customer service could have been a little better (it felt forced). When I said I was picking up Thor, the atmosphere just felt tense and really awkward. I asked how he did and was told Thor tried to bite the groomer a couple of times. The first thing that runs through my head is 'a couple?', Why not muzzle him ASAP the first time he snapped at you? I didn't really know what to say except sorry and that he has issues before I bolted out of there. 

Grooming wise, Just Like Home did a fantastic job. Thor was a mess before we brought him in, and he came out from there looking all clean and fresh. They even gave us a folder filled with info about all their services. 

PRO TIP: There's a 10% military discount on boarding services.  

Worth a Return Visit?
We probably won't be back for a grooming session but will keep Just Like Home Doggie Hotel & Grooming in mind for boarding services.

Last time I was here, I got the Fresh Burgher.  It's mozzarella, tomato, and basil with a balsamic glaze sauce.  It was almost perfect; a little more basil and it would indeed be fresh.  I've also tried their daily special, a Pittsburgher with (duh) coleslaw on it.  The burgers come with a side of mixed fries, so naturally, you have to put them on the burger.

My only ""complaint"" is that the fries have to be eaten while they're hot.  When they cool down, they're almost popcorn-like: crunchy exterior with an airy potato left on the inside, kinda like that hull-less popcorn, you know what I'm sayin'?  It really isn't a valid complaint - you have to eat your fries when they're hot...oh the horror!

trn_1200,"My wife met someone from here at a chamber of commerce (I think, may have been a WSD meeting) meeting last year, so when I became sick, I thought I would give them a call.  I called 5-7-18 and left a message.  A lady called me back finally this morning and I told her that I had left a message Monday.  She explained that she was out since Monday, (which I guess means if she is out, no one answers the phone or returns phone calls).  When I explained that I was no longer interested, she said ""yeah, well bye"" and hung up.  

Yeah, well bye Dr Scott Lamprecht.  I will never know if you are a good doctor or not.  Your staff should recognize that this is a doctors office, not a fast food establishment, and when someone is calling due to being ill, if you cannot answer the phone, a timely return call is, at least, a requirement.
Edit
I just talked to a co worker who said the same lady called my office first looking for me.  My co worker said she could provide my cell number and the girl said ""I don't know why he is calling us"" My co worker again offered my cell and the girl said yeah, ok, whatever.

trn_1201,"Organized a dinner with close friends, we were 8 and it was amazing. I know I will come back and so will my friends. Excellent service and food! One of us is vegan and had a salad, I tasted it out of curiosity.. it was purple-ish and spiced as I could taste a little garlic and it was just so good. I had the duck which was cooked perfectly, a mix of sweet and not sweet and the veggie mash it came with had a complexed tasty sweet taste. That same mash others had, was so good we had to ask the server what it was. Sorry I forgot the name but it wasn't potato and the server said its made with love and alot of butter. To me it tasted like heaven.
For desert I had the beignet which came with a salty caramel sauce..... that sauce.... just thinking about it I salivate and I'm not really a desert person.
We took pictures outside and one of the owners ( 1 of the 3 brothers) came outside to take picture of all of us. Did I say service was great? It was!
For us 8 it was our first time and not our last. Reasonably priced and for what you're getting it feels like a steal. I've paid way more for mediocre food.  For the record, I personally don't know the owners and was not paid to put this review but I felt compelled to brag about this place and hopefully I get to eat here again.
I took pictures of some of the plates so I keep in mind what I'll try next when I come back to Montreal.
FYI they have a share meal that some had which included the duck with fish and ribs with that mash... I will be back",1

I work near here and whenever I need a quick Thai fix, I come to King & I.  If you dine in, you would see that they have a lot of regulars here.  I always try to squeeze in a quick lunch with my main squeeze here.  As a matter of fact, this time around I ordered ahead of time, to have more QT with him over lunch.  When we got in, it looked a little busy, but our table was already set up with our food and drinks...WOW!! Soon as we sat down, they came by to ask if we would like anything else to drink other than our water that was already there.  

We shared a papaya salad at its spiciest level, they gave me spice levels of 1-4.  I said 3 and it had just enough kick to it.  Papaya salad was very fresh and it was also served with lettuce on the side too.  

Jesse N and I both had lunch specials.  I had Shrimp Pad Thai, he had Beef Panang Curry.  Lunch specials are about $7.95-$9.95 a plate.  Served with Won Ton Strips, Eggroll, Salad, Rice and your choice of entree.  Great deal for the price, I'm stuffed writing this review!  My Pad Thai was great tasting, not as spicy as I would like it, but then again, I was so hungry that I didn't even ask for my spices to make it spicier to my liking.  LOL, so yes, spicy wasn't there but that is an easy fix.  I had about 3 big sized shrimps in my Pad Thai, that may sound like a few pieces, but it was the whole shrimp, not shrimp that is all chopped up to say you had shrimp on your plate, and I like to portion out my meat with my fork full of carbs, and it matched up decently.  Tasted the Panang and that was actually flavorful.  I usually don't like panang, but King and I's version is yum!!

I was pleasantly surprised by this place; Food is very good, and the service is quick/courteous! I'll admit, like others have said, it's not the best PHO, but, it does the trick! Someone touched on the decor in another review; it's not great, but, c'mon, you don't go to these places for the interior design, you go for quick/tasty food!
I'm giving it a 4 - The PHO may not be as good as the spots on Ossington, but, for the area, i would say it hits the mark!

trn_1208,"Had a great waiter serving us on Friday. He was friendly and great with explaining and suggesting alternatives for my friend who tries to be gluten-free on a  very busy Friday night. 

We had a lovely vegan mushroom soup to start. Good portion. Still filling.

I had the trout with a celery root puree or was it parsnip? One of those vegetables. The two were great. It also came with Brussels sprouts, but it's the style where the sprinkle the leaves on your plate. It's not cut in halves. That was steamed/blanched. it didn't have any flavour to it so that didn't do anything to the plate. It was more for my veggie in take I gather. There's also pickled apricot on the side, but I'm not a fan of that so I just left it there. Trout was great, I enjoyed that.

Ended with Sticky toffee pudding.  It was yummy, not a dense one but still very flavourful. Nice poached pear slices topped off the dessert. It was yummy.

To be honest the reviews had me very leery.  Even my coworker said the staff is not that great, and it's unfortunate because it reflects badly on the doctor.  I went in expecting the worse and so far I have only had to see the doctor twice.  The first time I did wait for about 50 minutes before I even got a room.  I couldn't really complain because it was shorter than the wait I would have experience at Urgent Care.  So far I like the doctor.  She's very friendly although she did want to order additional testing which at the time I didn't think was necessary because it wasn't related to my visit.  My second visit was much quicker which could have had to do with her prior schedule commitments outside of the office.  I'm thankful I only get sick about once a year so based on my experiences with this office I will call them again if I have a future issue.",0
trn_1213,"1915 E. McDowell Road
Phoenix, AZ  85006

This restaurant has been reviewed by Zagats and others, and unless this was an off night the restaurant is not deserving of some of the praise that has been given it.

I was looking forward to eating at this restaurant. I and two companions arrived for dinner at 6:00 on a Saturday night. Parking is difficult at the restaurant and we ended up parking next door.

The decor was reminiscent of a typical place in Morocco, with wall hangings and hookah's along with lots of pillows being the main decorations. We were seated immediately and were promptly brought some very nice mint tea that was heavily sweetened. The tea was also available unsweetened.

After a very short wait, we were brought bowls of fava bean soup. The soup was a bit spicy, with notes of onion, cardamom, cinnamon and possibly a touch of clove. The spice didn't come into play until after it had been swallowed, when the slow burn started in the back of one's throat. Companion #2 could not eat the soup because of the amount of heat. No other soup was offered to her.

Next came a dish of two homemade pita's which seemed to be made of whole wheat and were unlike any other pita I had ever had. Each one was approximately 1 inch thick. Along with the pita's came a plate of hummus. The hummus had the usual flavors of garlic and possibly tahini, but it also had some other spices added to it that changed it's character totally from the familiar to the unfamiliar. It was o.k. as hummus goes, but the smooth, creaminess that I crave in a good hummus was missing, and was replaced with a grittiness that was not to my liking.

The owner came over and asked what we wanted to order. We had no menu's and none were offered, so we told him to surprise us. This was a mistake on our part. 

After a reasonable time, a tagine was brought out with veggies and some lamb along with a dish of couscous. The lamb, what there was of it, was flavorful and nicely cooked. However, at least half of it was bone. We did not bother to complain because we figured that there would be other dishes coming out and we would not be going away hungry. Another mistake on our part.

The owner certainly surprised us by not having another dish to serve to us. He claimed that there was 1.5 pounds of lamb in the dish. I claim that there was.5 pounds of bone in the dish. On top of that, he claimed that this dish was our entire dinner and there was nothing more coming out of the kitchen.

We asked about dessert, hoping that it would help us all fill up. We were brought a plate of small rope like pastries that appeared to have been fried, then coated in a light semi-sweet sauce and covered in sesame seeds. Each of us took one to eat, and we unanimously agreed that they were inedible.

We asked for our bill, and at $56.00 were startled at the cost, especially since we were all still hungry. Companion 1 said she wished she had stayed home.
A $5 tip was left.

2 stars for flavorful food, no star for service, and no star for portion size.",-1
trn_1214,i was surprised at the complexity of it. so much fun . higher tech. than I ever expected. unfortunately  the control operator forget to activate some of the features and some of the mechanism didn't work so we had to rely on more hints than we would of liked to .  we were glad we tried it but i'd like to try another location to  compare it.,0
trn_1215,"The staff is amazing. The food is uh-mazing!! Everything is hot and freshly made, so be prepared for a little wait, but it is so worth it! Their cannolis are to die for, I literally lick the plate (I have no shame).

All I can say is WOW...not only did they install an RO system but they fixed existing plumbing problems as they were working that were unrelated to their visit. So great!

Great job, very professional, fair price...didn't even charge us for some things.",1
trn_1217,"So I wanted to wait until I had gone to a few classes before reviewing. Now that I am hooked, I thought it was the appropriate time to write this review. 

I want to start off by saying, this is my first time in a true spin class. I cannot compare to other spin studios, because I have not been to them. But I like this one a whole lot, so I don't feel the need to seek out other classes.

Since I had never been to a spin class before, I decided to start with the beginner class they offer once a month. The instructor walks you through the equipment, how to attach your shoes to the pedals (side note-they have special spin shoes you can rent. The shoes click into place in the pedals), and how to adjust the resistance. Once the songs started, she called out instructions on how to pedal to the beat, when to come out of the saddle, lean back, push up, etc. She doesn't make you feel incompetent, rather, pushes you to do your best.

Now that I've been to a handful of classes, I can tell you that it is a tremendous workout each time. They keep the music fresh - the playlists have been different every week. The instructors continue to motivate and really engage with the spinners. Though the ride itself is done individually, the overall experience here is communal - everyone is very supportive of each other. 

The BEST part of the classes - they are in the dark, so you don't have the opportunity to compare yourself to other riders and no one can judge you if you are in need of a break. I wish I could do all my work outs in the dark!

The only downside to this studio is that it is so great that sometimes it's hard to get into classes. Schedules go live every Monday at noon and a lot of classes fill up in less than 5 minutes. A true testament to how amazing this place is! So get your ass in gear and get yourself signed up for a class!!!",1

trn_1221,"I hired Megan to take some family photos while my family was visiting from out of town. There was only one day that we would all be together at the same time and it happened to be a Tuesday. However, there were no photo studios open on a Tuesday. I needed to consider accommodations for my elderly mother who is unable to do much standing or walking. Therefore, I felt with no open studios, having a photographer come to my home and take some pics would be the best alternative seeing that I have a fairly large backyard with lots of greenery and well landscaped. I found Megan and was encouraged by the great reviews and felt lucky she was available. She arrived at my home a few minutes late, which was not a great first impression. She surveyed the areas inside and outside my home and decided to take photos in both areas. Megan was sweet and extremely accommodating to my elderly mother, making sure she was comfortable at all times. The overall photo shoot went great. It was the quality of the photos that I had an issue with. 

Pros:
1. As stated, Megan is sweet and accommodating during the shoot
2. Fast turnaround of digital images so that I could share w/ my family the same day

Cons:
1. The digital photos were delivered with 0% touch ups. I have not used a photographer in the last 15 years that did not deliver some sort of touch ups (skin smoothing, blemish removing,etc.). As I stated to her before she left, I would have been fine with waiting a week to get the pics, assuming that I would have had professional looking photos in the end.
2. My mother's bra strap is clearly visable in every photo. Most, if not all, professional photographers I have ever used takes the time before each shot to make sure everyone's clothes and hair are in place. She did none of that. 

Overall, I'm happy to have some photos to memorialize my family's visit. However, I could have saved myself good chuck of money had I just put my Nikon DSLR on the tripod and set the time delay. Would have gotten the same (if not better quality).",0

The drinks were well done and just right. Seating is up high and cozy. Great place to eat alone, with family, or friends. Its right off the strip. The place is clean, comfortable, reasonable. At one point the waitress accidentally filled my friends vodka with water (it was so funny) but they were apologetic and replaced it free of charge. The people here are genuinely friendly and great at customer service and quality food. Highly Recommended

trn_1225,"We were in town to watch our Ducks play the Pens and needed something to do.  If you're traveling without a car, and in the middle of winter, its hard to get around.  Fortunately the T-transit within the city limits is free, and we decided to get out of the cold by visiting this Science Center.

We arrive at little after 10 am, and paid $19.95 for a one day admission.  There's lockers for 50c or a free coat rack, but its left unattended.  We opted for the secure lockers for 50c.

The place has 4 levels, and geared mainly for kids.  All the floors are interactive, and there's even a Planetarium on the 2nd floor.  

It was a good way to kill 3 or 4 hours, and we headed back to our hotel in time to freshen up and get ready for the hockey game.",1

The meat on my parents' sandwiches was perfect- not too tough or chewy. Mine was delicious- even without meat. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave great recommendations and explanations of the menu. 

The only complaint that we have is that when they cleaned off our table there was an extra napkin that we don't think we used (and the staff surely doesn't know if we did) that they just put back on the clean pile on the counter. I know they were probably trying to reduce waste but it's also unsanitary because what if someone had used it or if it had gotten something on it while at the table.... I surely don't want to use used napkins when I come to a restaurant. (So we took off one star for this...)",1
trn_1229,Food was amazing service was great best thing about this place is that the people here know your name what is a big plus cause this place is packed with repeat regulars !!

trn_1230,"I love ""family style"" Japanese restaurants. Even though ""family style"" may remind you of Bucca Di Beppo, I assure you this is nothing like that!  

Let's break it down for you... order a plethora of items and dig in! I love when you can trust a server to pick out the best items and just let them go for it!  We just told them a price point per person we wanted to stick with and off he went.  Honestly, for $60 per person, we ended up with A LOT of food.  I was a little nervous, considering Japanese can get pricey, but by the end of the meal I could hardly finish the last dish (although I did:)

I think the marinade for each sashimi we got made each one, topped with the extremely fresh fish made those the stand outs of the evening for me. I thought they were all killer and would recommend any of these:

Yellowtail Jalapeno - garlic, cilantro, calamansi Soy with a fried jalapeno to top
Salmon Wasabi - wasabi crème, lemon Soy, crispy shallot, chives
Fluke Soy Salt - chili Oil, soy salt, citrus
Kobe Sashimi - a play on thinly sliced kobe beef, yumm-o!

We also ordered the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups. I thought the contrast between the cool lettuce and fried cod was really good.  I know this wasn't a favorite of the table, but I really enjoyed it!

Our last course was the sushi. The angry tuna roll was pretty amazing. I mean, deep fried sushi roll? Who wouldn't love it! The seared albacore was good and so was the yellowtail, but angry tuna, the star of the show, for sushi at least. 

I would definitely recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas, but one thing I will note is that we came in around 7pm and the place was dead, so you may be able to squeeze in last minute.  Ambiance is classy yet hip, so wear your hot cocktail dresses ladies and for dudes... something other than jeans and sneakers will do!",1

Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'!

It totally overpowered everything else in the burrito and she could not eat anymore. Now to lunch. We thought/hopes it would be different since it had been months since breakfast (breakfast was around Thanksgiving), however one of us left hungry again. This time it was me. I had the Steak Tacos and she had a Chicken Sandwich. My tacos were incredibly overspiced that I couldn't enjoy them, although I tried eating 2 of the 3.

I had the chicken makani,aloo gobi, (yes I was sharing with someone else lol) and this spinach and paner dish.....can't exactly remember but we ordered it as a side dish.  Oh and the mango lassi was to die for. Their rice is super fragrent and the whole cloves you could smell a mile away. Best indian restaurant ever. And being in love with Indian food and trying over 2 dozen trying to find the best one......is not at home in michigan its her in vegas. (Aunt lives her....so I will DEF be back) try it! You wont regret it

P.s. my waitress was from sri lanka, I forgot her name....but she was amazing!",1
trn_1246,"I live literally 3 minutes from this place so whenever I'm in a rush I go here to grab breakfast or when I'm with my friends and we have a craving for crepes and waffles we walk here and every time, I've regretted it, the staff is very unfriendly, they stand around chit chatting and not paying attention to guests, the food is fine to me, the chef looks like a nice guy and an okay cook so I feel bad for him to have to work with these unfriendly servers. Just don't go here, its a waste of time and money

food = 3/5
service = 1/5
cleanliness = 4/5",-1
trn_1247,If you're coming here for dinner you need to get there 30 minutes beforehand. There's a lot of people that comes so there's a long line and they do charge extra for holidays other than that the restaurant is cheap. There food on the trays of the best fit are cold. I got a ravioli and the chicken I marinated chicken in it was cold when I got to my table it did taste good though. I do recommend if you go make sure the chef makes you something fresh his cooking is really good on the spot. The desserts was the same as any other buffet  .  They had  little  pastries  it was a cannoli . It was really good .,-1
trn_1248,Why did I not read review first. I got the pesto chicken that said it was just made. It was stale and tasted pretty bad. I think I'll throw it away. Yuck.,-1
trn_1249,"While I still like the almond torte, I just can't justify my original rating when the overall selections are just subpar. After trying a larger selection of their baked goods, especially the mini cake cups, I realized they all look delicious but when you bite into them, they're really dry and full of generic cake frosting. 
If you're still tempted to get one,  go with the tiramisu since it has the redeeming factor of having a strong coffee flavor.",-1
trn_1250,"While Vintage is definitely an expensive spot, you absolutely get what you pay for. The service was incredible. Our server took the time to slowly explain the differences between the various cuts of meat as well as why you would want to have your meat cooked the way they recommend it. The food was just as good as the service; I probably had the best steak I've ever had in my entire life here.",1
trn_1251,"I went to Peppermill because my friend and I wanted to go out to eat when it was late, and not much was still open. We also didn't want to spend a lot. I suggested we give this place a try because I drive past it quite a bit and I haven't ever heard anything bad about it. When we arrived, we were seated right away, and our server greeted up quickly. Both of us ordered a burger and fries. The burger was a good size and it was yummy. I also ordered the strawberry shortcake which turned out to be really big, so I shared it with my friend. I would like to go back and try more of their food.",1
trn_1252,"Liverpool House serves some terrific food.  Definitely the best fois gras I've had in Montreal.  Beware though, it is a large size for 2 people, probably best for 4 as it is so rich and heavy.   Wine list was terrific.  I have the rabbit korma which seemed a bit off the wall for a restaurant like Liverpool, but it was quite delicious.  I've had my fair share of Indian food and I thought it had some very intense and authentic Indian flavors.  And the rabbit was extremely well prepared and tender.  I haven't been to Joe Beef yet, but this was really really good.

I docked a start for two reasons.  The first is really minor, and not really a complaint at all, but the menu was in French and had to be translated by our server.  I don't mind because I'm a visitor in their town and restaurant, but it was very busy and the server didn't really have the time to properly translate.  This limited my confidence in ordering a few dishes that I just wasn't sure about from her brief description.  The second issue was unfortunate as the seating is cramped and we were sat next to a really, really drunk and really loud group of people.  Our server was apologetic, but it ruined the experience to some degree.  Perhaps not their fault, but I'm reviewing my experience.  

Would certainly go back, although we'll probably try Joe Beef next time for a different experience.  Liverpool is definitely worth the trip.",1
trn_1253,"Oh, wow.  This place brought back memories of Mexico.  It's much more authentic Mexican than most places around here (and not so much Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex).  Not fancy -- pretty bare-bones hole-in-the-wall.  But very tasty!!!

My Enchiladas Mexicanas were fabulous with fresh avocado on top, for less than $10. Delicious home-made salsa on the side. Don't expect the same kind of ""Mexican"" that you get at chain restaurants.",1
trn_1254,My sisters and I have been coming here for a while and we've never been disappointed. They are amazing with color and haircuts! My sister has gotten her perm done here and it looks so nice and healthy. The staff is so fun and friendly too! This is a really great hair salon!!,1
trn_1255,"I came here during my 21st birthday trip. We were on the guest list so we had to come before 10:30pm. We skipped the general line and went straight to the lady to take our name. Unfortunately, there was a mix up but the lady still let our group in. 10/10 for that. The club itself was really nice! We stayed on the dance floor and it wasn't too crowded! No one kept bumping into us or anything and the other guests were pretty nice! No one thought they were better than anyone at this club, unlike Hakkasan. This resulted in a very nice vibe. The drinks here were pricey, about $40 for two drinks, however, it was good and i was celebrating my birthday so eh, why not? The guest performance was logic and keep this in mind, all of the artists usually performs at 2AM! this is like every club! Hakkasan was the same with Zedd. So if you can, come party here as close as it is to 2AM. I definitely recommend this club. My party had a blast! Also, it wasn't as stuffy as other clubs since it had a patio like thing.",1
trn_1256,"Cleo stood out when I was looking for a nicer somewhat more upscale dinning place for a fast birthday dinner. We made a reservation through open table for 645 for two, and when we got there the place was pretty empty. 

The hostess is the reason why I gave this place a 4 star, there were probably 4 tables taken in the restaurant and she sat us right by the entrance in a small table. When we asked for a table towards the back for more privacy she gave us the unwilling look, and the other employee saw her and gave her that same face back like ""they are one of those customers type of looks"". 

The server recommended about 4-5 dishes to share for two people. 

We got the babaganoush with the pita bread, calamari and Brussel sprouts to start. The pita bread is fresh out of oven very soft and chewy, definitely one of the best pita breads I have had. 
 The calamari was delicious too, the sauce goes great with the calamari. 
It is a must try. Brussel sprouts is my favorite food already, the way they fried the sprouts really brought out the flavor and the texture of it. 
The second round we got the moussakah,  wagyu beef and chicken kabob, the chicken kabob was ok, but the beef one was very tender and juicy. 
If I had to pick a favorite it would be the sprouts and least favorite would be the moussakah, it was baked and tasted very creamy. 

The dessert was fig and almond panacotta. The figs we got were dried figs, weren't  fresh like shown in some of the pictures on here, but the panacotta itself was delicious.

The GM also stopped by personally to check on us. Great food place to check out if you want quick upscale food",1
trn_1257,"Service was good and fast! There are a few tables inside to pick from and there are tvs are playing as well. 

The menu has a variety of different drinks and tons of flavors. We opted for a regular yogurt black tea with strawberry popping boba and a supersize taro and vanilla milk tea with regular boba. 

There are only two sizes and our total came out to be about $9.00 for two drinks. The taro w vanilla was a little too sweet for my liking but it was drinkable. The tea was very good and quite refreshing! 

There is plenty of parking and it's located in the same plaza as lee lees.

I will be back to give it another try.",1
trn_1258,The awesome lady chiro who used to work here is not here anymore. She was amazing and when my family came here from Hawaii they all love here so I can tell you she was great! When I came the last time they had some new guy here that smelled like an old man bathed in old spice and the experience was not enjoyable mostly because I didn't feel relief like I had wanted to. They offer a monthly service fee to some a few times a month or you can pay per visit. It's quick to get in and out most of the time but we won't be coming back were looking For her and we will find her!,-1
trn_1259,I came here for dinner before the rush. It was clean and the staff was good about fielding questions. Very reasonable prices. Will return.,1
trn_1260,"Been coming here for a while but no more! Had a horrible experience here yesterday with a very unprofessional manager. Please don't waste your time coming here for the mediocre food, alright beer selection, and crappy staff. Try Zips sports grill instead. Way better!!!",-1
trn_1261,"I would give ZERO stars if I could. Seriously, save yourself time and money. My boyfriend reserved car through advantage for our California trip. On the website it said ""unlimited mileage.""
When we got to the rental car place, the Asian guy asked ""where are you headed"" we said ""California.""  In the straightest face possible and with the rudest attitude- He said ""you're not going to make it.""(WTF do you mean we aren't going to make it) 
He said ""there is a cap of 150 miles because people were abusing our cars."" OKAY. So why on the websites did it say UNLIMITED MILES! 

Don't go to advantage. They are stupid! It's .39 cents for each additional mile. 

Horrible service too! Don't tell me we won't make it! Cause technically we would! The car doesn't automatically at 150 miles!",-1
trn_1262,"This restaurant looks nice inside and out!  It is located in charming Scottsdale.  The food was simply amazing!  I've had nothing like it!  It's like.. American-styled Japanese food.  
I tried...
Tuna Tartare - It comes with delicious Nori Chips!
Hot Rocks - Sizzle!
Taneko CA roll - Real crab meat!
Asparagus and Avocada tempura roll - Kind of like a ""salad"" roll.
Edamame - It was just alright.
Taneko Salad - It was very fresh with yummy ginger-sesame dressing.
Tempura Oysters - Wow this was the highlight of my meal!  I loved this so much.  It was soooo good.. I want some more
American Kobe Burger - So good and melty!  I love the fingerling potatoes also!

Overall, I enjoyed the meal very much.  The service was superb and they even packed my left overs in a box with a nice looking bag.  Our meal ended with delicious dark chocolate.  I'd come here again if I lived in the area!",1
trn_1263,"First time here, service is fast and friendly. They have a very nice selection of different types of burgers, and a variety of sides and milkshakes. I ordered the funguy burger clever name since it had grilled mushrooms on it  It was really good, not very filling though. My friend got the Fat Doug burger which had pastrami on it and it looked delicious, he said it was good and filling. I'll probably get that next time. All in all it was a good experience and about average pricing.",1

trn_1265,"My husband and I had not been to this place since it changed ownership, but we went last Sunday and were not disappointed, which is an understatement. Another reviewer mentioned the Huevos Divorciados, which is what I had, and they were AMAZING. My husband asked them to switch bacon for ham in his omelet, and they happily complied. He said it was the best omelet he's ever had. We will definitely be back! My only quandary is whether to try something else on the menu - it all sounds so good - or to get the Huevos Divorciados again.",1
trn_1266,The food is delicious (I recommend the Cat Lady) and SOMETIMES THE CATS RIDE SKATEBOARDS! My heart is so warm from my visit to this little cat cafe!,1
trn_1267,"Do not go here!  My step-dad owned a business and he got all his trucks serviced here so when my AC went out on my car, he suggested to let them do it.  It cost about $1,000.  I got my car back and then within a few days I heard a clinking sound coming from my engine. i was on the freeway and I started to get nervous so I pulled off the 60 on Priest because the next exit wasn't that close.  I got off the ramp and my engine shut off towards the end of the ramp and I had to roll to the QT right off the freeway.  A cylinder part in my car that has to do with AC in my engine had come loose and got jammed in my engine.  So had i not gotten off the freeway I could have killed myself and others but luckily I got off.  So we took it back and they fixed it.  Well then a day later I am driving and again i hear the same sound.  I was right near my house and was turning on my street when again my engine shut down.  Again, THANK GOD, I was right by my house and in a residential area and not on the main road where again I could have crashed and killed myself and someone else.  The other cylilnder part (there are two cylinders or whatever the part is called) had come loose and was bouncing around in my engine.  So I called irrate at this point and the owner had the nerve to actually cuss me out and yell at me saying ""Are you going to Bitch at me all day long or bring your F***ing car in so we can fix it!?""  
After that I didn't even go back because I was sooooooooo mad. So I paid a whole other person to fix my AC.  
So my advice, DO NOT go here.  If this guy treated me like this when it was his shop who almost got me seriously injured, and my step dad had even gave him business for years and was a good customer, who knows how he would treat you.  I would never give my money to someone so nasty as the guy in that shop.",-1

trn_1270,"This is one of my favorite places to grab a burger at! I have been going to this restaurant since i was old enough to sit on a barstool. They have other great options as well if you don't feel like a burger. Their fried zucchini is great as well as their chicken fingers and fish n chips. This place is located in a strip mall type parking lot but don't let it fool you, if you want great service and good food . . . Make sure you stop here",1
trn_1271,"What an awful club. It's no wonder Drai's has to have promoters stationed everywhere on the strip practically begging passerby to come inside. 

I'll admit, my friends and I used this club as our pregame before going to Marquee for the night. Used our free drink tickets and got the heck out. The clientele was not what we were looking for - we just wanted to dance and not be creeped on by 40 year old men. There wasn't anywhere to sit or really stand for that matter that you felt like you weren't in the way. The dancing girls were awkward for us. 

I will say, there is a nice view, since this club is on the roof of the Cromwell. 

Other than that, I would have no desire to return. For an older audience, or for those who can't get guestlisted/free bottle service elsewhere, I guess this would be a decent pick. 

However, I personally, as a 25 year old female, will go elsewhere to dance and drink while in Vegas.",-1
trn_1272,"Our family of 5 have been coming here for about 10 years. It has always been the best soft-serve cream and service. They have been very accommodating to our son back when he had a peanut allergy. We know the owners and will not be calling them out in the review but certainly, they need to get to the bottom of recent experiences.

This place had been going down the past few years but today was the nail in the coffin. Memorial Day weekend. 85 degrees and the busiest ice cream weekend after July 4th. All we wanted was some ice cream, as we have done hundreds of times before. 

When we walked in, the place looked like Omaha Beach during WWII! Counters empty; ice cream bins half-empty; one person visibly working, etc. My son wanted a banana barge sundae. The girl working looked at me like I asked for a hand painted Picasso! ""Uh sorry I don't know how to make that but I can try I guess I mean if you still want it. I'm not sure where the cup for that is...."" So I say ok, can you make this one and maybe put a banana in to it? ""Uh, I guess I will try if you want me to.."" WTF? No, I don't want you to - I want you to sell me a 6-month Dish Network Satellite subscription instead! Anyway, she goes off and tries to do her thing. After 5 minutes she brings back the replacement and the ice cream is all melted since she put wayyy too much hot fudge in the cup. I give the leaky nightmare to my son - enjoy it little fella! Fine, we will survive right?

Round Two; My ""Sundae dasher"" ""Uh, I think the vanilla machine is going...(other worker appears and is all frazzled..) Uh, I don't think it is supposed to make that noise.. but she continues to make my dasher with more hot fudge. As half of the dasher is made, she catches that the vanilla machine is now out of vanilla - but she still tries to fill it up with watery vanilla and give it to me. It looks like watery syrup! ""U still want it? I guess it would probably be ok, right?"" She starts swirling her spoon in it to show me..I say No thanks-  that is a milkshake at best so no. My wife, who wanted a very complicated item - a small ice cream cone (Vanilla) - was SOL.

There were other things that happened that I will not bore you with but, out of the 10 people that came in while we were enduring our pain, 5 left and the remaining ones all had some issues with their orders. A complete mess and debacle! Whoever is managing now is either unaware or clueless! Mr. you-know-who - please come back and right-track your shop before it is too late!!!",-1

trn_1275,"This is my go-to for Mexican-American food in Oakland. It's a chain restaurant, so you can expect a similar experience to any other Chipotles that you have visited.

The main reason I would recommend Chipotle over the other Mexican restaurants in the area is that this seems to be most students' favorite spot as well. This means that new customers are continuously being served throughout the day which means all the meats were prepared recently. Food is constantly on rotation, so you don't have to worry about ingredients being left out for too long.",1
trn_1276,"Hmmm...this place eeks out a 2.5 if i'm being brutally honest.. We came here for a costume party and were privileged to receive happy hour priced drinks for the entire night. This ended up being an excellent deal at a $3 per well drink, and I think they made em pretty well.

They also offered free beer to those of us participating in the beer pong tournament and this was certainly welcomed by yours truly. I don't think the service was much to write home about but they had a cool patio area and a neat bar area to hang out in.

As I mentioned earlier, the food is the least redeeming quality of this place. At least it was pretty well priced with the happy hour prices. The chicken quesadilla was filling but pretty bland. I think they could have used more spices. The chicken tenders were awful and tasted like something out of a school cafeteria. Dry and unflavored. 
I'm lukewarm about this place at best.",-1
trn_1277,"Timing is everything. And because of the movie I really wanted to see, along with everyone else, it was really busy. Which I don't understand why we had to purchase our tickets at the concession stand while the ticket desk was CLOSED!!!

We waited in line for 30-minutes to purchase tickets because the line was moving very slow as people were also making decisions on purchasing food and waiting for it.  Now of course, we could purchase our tickets online, but when we checked, the show we wanted to see was practically sold out. And just for the heck of it, we wanted to double check with someone;  which didn't changed. We ended up not watching the movie and left.

Plain and simple, this comes down to operations management that should know better that on a major movie opening weekend, like Star Wars, you need a fully staffed team to ensure efficiency and comfort of your customers. The reason why? Because there are plenty of options, we're taking our business elsewhere.

First impressions mean everything and you can tell, this was an absolutely terrible experience for my husband and I. We have plans to never return to this theater.",-1

My major issue is with an extremely spotty pick-up experience. Canteen and other food fight restaurants have food delivery/pickup via app using ChowNow. The app is fine, but as of late ordering pickup has been painful. I don't think my expectations are that high - order online, have the order ready to pickup in 30 minutes, but I've been let down the last two times:

Take 1 (three weeks ago): Was super hungry, ordered pickup at 12:07, get an email 18 minutes later that it'll be ready for pickup at 12:55 PM.

Take 2 (today): Ordered around 11:25, got email saying my order would be ready at 11:54. Got there at 12:04, saw my order on the counter, and had to wait ten minutes for them to pack up my to-go order and let me on my way.

trn_1294,"This place was a lot of fun! I went with my boyfriend and one of our friends when we felt like trying a new sushi place. Yes, it's a bit of a sacrilege to cheat on our usual spot, but this was a venture well worth making. 

Service was polite but not entirely enthusiastic when we started out. It took a few minutes for our drinks to arrive and a bit longer for our first orders of food. 
 
There are lots of items are available on their AYCE menu. Some of the highlights: Tuna naruto roll! (cucumber wrapped around fresh fish & crisp veggies with the screaming O sauce- very similar to Pumi's ""Rock n' Roll"" that Jaime's sought out ever since I met him & he was very happy to have found), FRESH grated wasabi root, scallops, yuzu yellowtail, screaming orgasm (sashimi special), large menu of hot appetizers, sweet shrimp and several other nigiri and sashimi options I haven't seen at other spots. On a thursday night the bar was fairly busy, which is a good sign for a spot that's a little off the major street. 

The staff openly spoke in Japanese while in the front, but with a bit of a sardonic laugh afterwards.  Since the music was pretty much all K-Pop when we where dining here, we asked the chef if he knew about jindo dogs, which is what our pup is. He was from Korea and opened up quite a bit when he realized we were interested in and knew a little about his culture. We had lots of hot of sake and he did multiple shots with us, talking excitedly about different foods and sayings. They may have been a little distant at first, but the service was MUCH more friendly after that. They even gave us a small bowl of house kimchi to sample, as well as some pieces of fried halibut. I asked him about the saying ""Aigoo"", since I'd heard it tons but never grasped the meaning. He explained (it's kind of like ""Oh shucks!"") and then used it every chance he could get; ""Aiiigooooo!!! More sakeeeee! Aigooo!!! I burned the unagi!""

We'll be back! Once they opened up to us, the atmosphere went from awkward restraint to jubilant party-time. I can see that leading to mixed service, and the girls who came in later in the evening as we were getting ready to go didn't seem like they were very happy. Our experience, however, was fabulous and I look forward to returning. The main downsides are that they do not have salmon, outdoor seating and the service could be iffy.",1

We ordered three completely different items an all were still warm (it was about 2:30 pm) and delicious - not even a crumb made it out of this boulangerie unless it was in our stomachs.   Coffee also excellent.

Only a short stroll  (couple of blocks0 from a metro stop.  If in the area, I highly recommend it!",1
trn_1298,"Updating not because of the food, which is awesome as ever, but because of the parking situation, which is waaaaay out of hand.  Not BLD's fault, but, fellow diners beware!  Don't even think about it on a weekend evening.  :(",1
trn_1299,"I've done business with Audio Advice for 30 years now, first in Raleigh and now here in Charlotte.  Their team is the best I've seen in Audio, Video and Automation.  In fact, I'd rate my experience with them as among the best in any industry.  Leon Shaw and his team not only carry and sell the best gear in the industry but they live and breathe this stuff personally.  Everyone working at Audio Advice is passionate about their own experience with audio, video and home automation.  

I've worked with different folks over the years.  Mostly Leon and Ivan up in Raleigh.  Mostly Dustin and Robert here in Charlotte.  I recommend all of them highly.  All are very honest and direct and can be relied upon to give the very best advice.  When they discuss something as simple as a component or as complex as a whole house system, they bring their own experience into the equation and they approach each solution with a longer term approach in mind (rather than making a quick sale).  This is why I've been and remain a lifelong customer and why I feel good referring my friends and family to them.",1
trn_1300,"If you haven't tried this place, I highly recommend you do! WOW!!! Staff members are courteous and quick, but the food is what keeps me and my family going back! I typically order the gringo enchiladas and my husband likes the flaming fajitas. We've eaten here several times and only once was our order wrong. The staff was quick to fix it and made it right immediately. Our glasses are never empty and always leave with our bellies full.",1
trn_1301,"Great place for a celebratory dinner. Primarily seafood menu with giant stuff lobsters. This is my husband's favorite place to go in Phoenix.  We go for his birthday every year.  It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it. 

There is a romantic ambiance with dim lights. ASK FOR A BOOTH!  Otherwise the tables are pretty close together so it feels like you're part of their experience too.",1
trn_1302,"This place is just down the street from my house, so we finally made our way over here to check it out, as my partner and I both love a good brunch.

I don't think either of us will be back. The wait was only a couple in front of us, but took almost 25 minutes to be seated, and the way the restaurant was laid out, we had to basically stand in front of the door while waiting.  Also, I had to chase down the waiter to even get on the wait list.

Once seated, I opened the menu, ready to get the black bean burger I'd seen online...their only non-egg vegetarian item.  I had purposely scouted the menu online before coming in, since they didn't seem super veg friendly.

Yeah. Apparently, they no longer serve veggie burgers. Nope.  So when I asked our server, as a vegetarian, what I could get, she told me there was some sort of dish that one of the servers made with cottage cheese, mushrooms and avocado.  I had no option but to ask for that.

When it came out, after a good deal of time, it was a small cup of oily mushrooms, a plate with half an avocado on it, and a small cup of cottage cheese.  Um. Gross.

I stole a piece of my partner's toast, mixed in ketchup with the mushrooms, and put it on the toast with a little avocado on top. It was ok, but I could have made it better myself, and for less than the almost $7 they charged me for my ""meal.""

Add to that the homophobia and transphobia we felt, plus the coffee refill guy walking past my partner's empty cup not once, not twice, but three times, and we'll not be back. Which is too bad, because my partner love love loved her Denver omlette and hashbrowns.  Folks, it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant.",-1

Unfortunately the food was sub-par and oversalted.  I had the carnitas and had to send them back to the kitchen exchange for chicken fajitas because they were so salty I couldn't stomach choking down a whole plate. The chicken fajitas were ok but rather dry. I had a strawberry frozen magarita that tasted soley like cheap tequila.

I've been previously and the food was solid. So maybe the kitchen was having a bad noght.",-1

The Brats are really not great, I got the Red Brat that 'Alumni Love' and I've had better brats at a tailgate! Brat had no extraordinary flavor and the bun was blah.

Though I did love the decor in this bar, the beer selection, the mustard/condiments bar, the plethora of tv's and the nice nice people! I can see how this would be a fun place to come as a college student!",0
trn_1307,"Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.

I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.

First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.

There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here.",1
trn_1308,"The Dr himself seems fine & very thorough as mentioned in other review. He was a professor before he practiced which I thought was very different & seemed beneficial to his bed side manor. However the staff is what drove us out. The wait was an HOUR past the appointment time. The total wait time was 1 hour & 15 minutes to get to examination room. The wait in the examination room was 10 minutes. The Dr visit was fine. He asked plenty of good questions did examination & as I said was thorough. Then we were put to wait an additional 15 minute wait on the staff to get blood work paperwork & I went to front desk to ask what the hold up was & the one competent staff member I met was schooling another staff member on how to list vitals... WOW!!!! So we left on that note. 
Side note: I was there to take my Mom & she had been to this Dr before & said it wasn't like this in the years past. So it is 100% staffing issues. So unfortunate that he's good Dr surrounded by bad staff.",-1
trn_1309,"Love his place... they need a spot in PhX but whatever. People were super cool even when they were busy. The food is bomb.com, great for leftovers and big groups. I love the food and the options. Took my boss from KC and even his leg was shaking. Everything  has been awesome. 

Couple of frustrating things that took me a few visits to understand. The upgrade on fatty meat is weak and cheap of them to even ask. Cut the brisket and serve it... don't airline the fuck out of your customers. Cheap move ‍... just saying. The menu needs work because they leave a lot out. For example, platters have no sausage listed and the paper menus doesn't have the same set up or items the overhead menu has. They need better to go options...bags/carriers and sauce packs. I'd even pay extra to not have 60 sauce things & a flimsy ass bag (only one size and the boxes don't even complement the bags so i don't get it) and no drink holders... which is weird cause they have a coffee bar, tea and a huge selection of drinks in general. That's just feedback for the owners. 

Never had a bad experience and the food is better than excellent.",1

trn_1311,"Within the last week and a half, I've been to Caswell's 4 times. The first visit was to purchase my Glock 17 and the other three visits were to shoot. All four times I have experienced nothing but great customer service. The staff is so knowledgable and has been really great about giving advice and tips whenever you need it. I've been to other ranges where you get overlooked when it's busy, but here, the staff makes it a point to acknowledge your presence and let you know that they'll help you as soon as they can. The shooting range is air conditioned and each lane has an automated target retrieval which I personally like a lot. You just enter the distance you want your target at, press GO, and it sends your target there. The lanes have been clean and functional each time I've gone and I've never had any issues. Overall, I am very happy and satisfied with the pricing and customer service that Caswell's has offered. I will definitely be back!",1
trn_1312,"I am becoming disappointed in Asahi. The last few times have been, not the greatest experience. As i mentioned in my earlier review, this is the go-to sushi place for me and my co-workers, as it is seconds from the office. Really though, the service is terrible lately. Not to fault the servers, as they are rushing like mad.. there just are not at all enough servers on. Three servers for two floors is ridiculous. The average wait times for meals has skyrocketed. Today we waited over 35 min for our meals. The sushi came out before the salads and miso soup ""appetizers"" and they completely forgot my Sriracha even though I asked for it Twice.

My coworker ordered his sushi combo at the same time the rest of us did, and he never received it. 45 min later, our manager had to leave (after scarfing his meal rapidly in under 10 min) and sushi-less coworker was left waiting for his meal. When he flagged down the waiter, they had forgotten to enter it into the computer. Our manager paid for the entire team's bill, but our one coworker whose sushi was MIA was presented his own bill on the side. He complained, obviously, as it was not his fault that they had forgotten to put it on the company bill and asked if he could get any sort of discount. They refused. 

My $7 Hamachi sashimi was not the highest quality today and tasted very ""frozen"". Additional minus points for disposable chopsticks. 

Disappointed, as we have been there so many times.. but it really is getting considerably worse. New sushi suggestions for Y&B welcome!",-1
trn_1313,"Stayed here for 3 years  in the one bedroom with den and definitely enjoyed the stay. Had a nice partial view of the strip. Loved the layout of this apartment.
Moved out because we recently bought a house. 
Office staff was mostly kind and easy to deal with.  Jessica and deedee being the best.
Had A few minor issues, but
Maintenance was always prompt and fixed things right. 
Also had some noisy neighbors, but they came and went.
Only once did we ever see any large police presence and it was because of something that occurred off the property. 

Bottom line
If you rent in Las Vegas, go with Ovation properties. Living here and their old property, Verona, my first 7 years in this town were great.",1
trn_1314,"Carol you are the best service person/waitress I have ever met. I believe you must be clairvoyant...I just THINK coffee and you're pouring it. Our orders and sides took a couple of trips, but everything arrived hot and ready. The excellent service continued even after we paid as   carol followed me out to make sure I didnt forget the babys juice. How awesome is that? I go to alot of restaurants some $ some up to $$$$.  Carol who works at gus' s is the best!!! Now--the food--my daughter really liked her food especially the french toast. My grandaughter said her ham and egg muffin had the best ham she ever tasted. The sausage gravy not great but biscuit was very good. I got over- cooked eggs, very dry like chopped up old potatoes, and there was a seasoning in the corned beef that I did not like.  The corn beef was properly cooked and some people probably like it--just not me.  If my daughter had written this review no doubt it would have been a 4 or 5. She liked everything. Maybe new  visitors will too. At any rate, try to meet carol.  The other servers seemed quick and friendly too.",0

But honestly, hats off to both Adam and Justin who work in maintenance - they are by far the most reliable and hard working gentlemen I've ever had the pleasure of rendering any service for the unit in which I reside. The remaining staff are as helpful and cheery - are never problematic or even slightly indecent with the residents. I have to say, if this place's rates weren't so high - I would definitely continue to live here on the property. Again, one last shout out to Justin and Adam! :CD",1

However, it is way way way way too expensive in a royally offensive way.  I'm a huge fan of the food but the prices prevent me from going here regularly.  Spending 9-10 dollars on a hot dog, fries and a drink is silly when I can go to all the casinos and get a one dollar hot dog where the quality is just as good.",0

trn_1321,"Seemed like a fun place with music & dance floor.  However, the service was really slow, even though it seemed to be winding down from the after work crowd.  We waited 45 minutes for a beef dip and a cajun chicken wrap.  The beef dip bun was burned black on the inside, it would be impossible to miss.  When the server inquired about our meals we pointed this out and she asked how they were otherwise.  We asked for our bill.  We were prepared to pay exact change and at that point she took the plate to the manager who took that off our bill.  About two hours later the stomach cramps, fever & head ache set in (chicken wrap, not the beef dip).  48 hours later I am still feeling the effects.  I don't recommend the food here.",-1
trn_1322,I love Henry I'm so glad i was referred to him. I do not go to anyone else for my hands. Last time i did and you say hi to Henry one of the girls was mocking me as i said hello to him while she was working on my nails. When ever she did my nails (SNS powder) they chipped at least 3 times in less than 2 weeks when they normally last me 3 weeks when Henry does them. So after all of that i will never go to anyone but Henry when it comes to my hands. You can easily hide your feet but not your hands.,1

trn_1325,"Went on opening day and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our waiter had a few kinks with the ordering system and they didn't have all of their menu items available but I'm not going to nitpick.

The place was decorated very nicely with a clean modern look. The patio area also looked good but I don't think it was in use yet. It was very spacious inside and the tables were not cluttered like in many other restaurants to seat as many as possible. 

The menu has lots of great sounding options and they have a good variety of freshly squeezed juices. The food was incredible! I ordered 2 eggs with sausage links and my girlfriend went with the breakfast quesadilla. We were definitely not let down with the food. They have nicely seasoned hashbrowns which were outstanding! The pancakes were also amazing! Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. I will certainly be coming back.",1

trn_1333,"Cafe Monarch is a fine Dinning Restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale. This is a multi award winning restaurant. Voted best romantic restaurant in the country by Yelp....Voted Number ONE Restaurant of Scottsdale by Tripadvisor out of 956 restaurants (in 2018). This is a reservation ONLY restaurant. Walk ins are not accepted. They offer fixed priced four course dinners that run at 2018 prices of between $80-$140.00. Wine pairing runs around $95.00 a person or you can purchase cocktails or bottles of wine. We thought the bottle pricing was a reasonable mark up. They only marked up the pricing less than half on our bottle and many places usually mark up the prices much more than that. The menu changes every other week so it's unlikely you will be able to try what I tried.

To cut a long story short.........

Atmosphere is amazing.....if weather is nice you might want to request patio dining in your reservation.

Service was very professional and servers are trained in sommelier training.

The food is mostly very detailed and high quality. 

If they offer the Squash Blossom Relleno - GET IT......It was one of the very best things I tried anywhere. Very Complex and full of textures...so flavorful....wish I could eat a plate of them.

Another favorite of the evening was the Yellow Fin Tuna Crudo.......Really Great......full of flavors.

The dirt......Chairs inside are not so comfortable. Springs are broken and chairs are in need of repair or replacement.

More DIRT.....Not a fan of the Bananas Foster bread pudding....so much so I might never order dessert here again...Very dense, not sweet, unripe bananas.....

A most lovely dinner....not perfect....but for the most part if I ignore the dessert ...then very good -  to -  exceptional.

4.5 stars",1
trn_1334,"I love pizza!

After reading all of the reviews, my husband and I decided to place an order for delivery today!

We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, half with sausage & pepperoni.  It was delivered within 35 minutes to our house.  (-1 star: $3 delivery fee.)

The crust was a perfect combo of chewy and sturdy and yummy.  The sauce isn't too acidic (my husband gets acid reflux like crazy) and it didn't affect him at all.

We will order from here again, b/c they deliver good quality pizza.

Now excuse me while I go inhale another piece of pizza...

-UPDATE:
So I just updated this because after eating the pizza, you feel ok.  Then about 30 minutes later you realize you just ate the greasiest pizza ever and and you want to hurl.  I'll pass next time if someone wants me to eat Biaggio's pizza.",-1

If it's full, it's full.  

Anyway, though (I think) many of these reviews are relatives, they are spot on.  It's a good place to eat Filipino food.  

Everything I tasted from the lumpia to the adobo was excellent.  And the mother/daughter/son running the place were so nice and helpful it felt like eating at home.  I want to go back very soon, especially on a Friday when they have some delicious pig, i think it's called lechon baboy.  mmmm.

Don't expect gourmet, silverware or place settings.  Expect good (excellent) home cooked Filipino with a twist of Mexican.  This is what you really want, go eat some!",1

trn_1342,"I really wanted to like this Starbucks, but it left a bad impression on my mind!! If I could leave this place zero stars, I would. 

I came around 7 am on a Sunday. There was one lady ahead of me who ordered 3 drinks and a few breakfast items. Since there was only one person working, I did understand that I'd have to wait, but the lady was working super slow on purpose!! Her walk and her movements were so slow. I've never seen a person work so slow in my life before!! I stood there 15 minutes before she came to the register to take my order.

Once she came to the register, she said in a monotone voice ""What can I get you"" as she rolled her eyes at me. I almost just left at that point. No need to get all mean at me. I didn't act impatient or ask her to hurry up, so why in the world do you feel it necessary to roll your eyes at me??? 

I put in my order and paid..then stood around and waited some more. She finally finished the order of the person ahead of me before starting my order. After about 25 minutes I got my order, but of course, it was made incorrectly. I didn't feel like dealing with her again, so I just took it like it was. 

No sooner was she done with my order, there came a whole bunch of other people and her disposition change completely. She was all friendly and got people's orders out quickly! I don't want to say she was discriminating against me, but that is how I felt. How can you treat me one way and treat everyone else another way?

Other than her, the place was dirty and not kept up. All tables were still dirty and sticky from other customers. It didn't look as though the people that closed up the night before did any cleanup. The trash was full, and the table where the sugar and milk is was all disorganized and dirty as well. At least the restroom was clean. 

Probably will not come back to this location. Worst experience at a Starbucks ever!",-1

Came here for a small get-together on a Saturday night. While the waiters had initially told us there was no way we would be getting a table for 8, they worked hard to make room for us and even chased us down College St. to bring us back. 

They have a variety of burgers, including a very expensive $19 Kobe burger. I opted for the rather cheap $6 original burger with a side of sweet potato fries. There wasn't really much of a wow factor to the burger, but it was quite good. The sweet potato fries were very good as well, although they had a touch too much salt. 

The decent burgers, along with the cheap beer resulted in quite a good night. I'd definitely recommend it.",1
trn_1348,"Opted for the standard 4oz Fresh Burger and fries combo. Although the patty itself was good, I would have enjoyed a few more free toppings. You do get all the traditional items (cheese, tomato, lettuce and their own special sauce - plus a choice of optional onions or pickles, if you fancy them) as a base, the premium toppings will run you a $1.00 per topping. So your burger tab can add up pretty quickly. Fries were great and I suggest trying the gravy, it's equally delicious. Wish they had onion rings as a side but can't fault them for that. It definitely lives up to its name ""Fresh"" as the burger was made from scratch in front of us. Kids loved it! We will be back with the family again.",0

Also it's FREEZING in here, so if you are cold natured bring a sweater or something. My friends and I were shivering. If you are coming as a bachelorette party, don't expect to feel special because EVERYONE attending is probably with another bachelorette party. I couldn't even count how many brides to be were there that night! It's pretty obvious that he performers pick older women (like grandma's age kinda older) to bring on stage - so if you are young and cute, you ain't gonna get picked to go on stage. The host of the show was super funny, performers were in great spirits and you can tell they have a blast doing what they do.",1

trn_1352,"I tried to shop here today to buy multiple shoes for work. This Hispanic girl (using her phone while on duty then sticking it behind her ass as she approached me) asked if I needed help. I asked her if there were any specials and told me they were having a sale. I told her I have several emails with coupons and she said just as long they have a barcode, I can use. I also mentioned I had a  25% coupon my coworker had gave me. She immediately told me I cannot use a ""print-screen"" coupon as if I was a con artist. Then she walked away and did not bother helping me. My coworker told me her Payless location let her use the coupon regardless if it was a print screen. So I was furious and decided not to purchase anymore. Instead I just tried on shoes and took pictures of the model numbers when I knew I liked them. I left the store, went home, and shopped online using the 25% coupon she said I couldn't use and free shipping. Too bad their store would've made over $100 extra revenue off of me but they chose to treat loyal customers with bad customer service. From now on, I'm just going to purchase my shoes online. Thanks lazy girl with an attitude!",-1

trn_1354,"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake. 
     We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. 
     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is ""I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here."" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.
     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled ""are you getting paid for this?"" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.
     We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away.",-1
trn_1355,"On my recent visit to Toronto, my work friends took me here for Lunch. I ordered the 2 course lunch special. I had the lobster crab bisque to start with. It was pretty good as most folks have noted.

The real surprise came when my Thai style vegatable curry came. Now just to clear something up, I am a meat and potatoes kinda guy. It was one of those rare days when I didnt feel like having meat. I am so glad I had this dish. It was just a perfect blend of spices with coconut milk and basil. The vegetables were done perfectly, not too soogy. I could not believe how much I enjoyed this dish. I like Thai food and can easily say this curry was one of the best I have ever had.

Now a few days later, I find myself craving that delicious vegetable curry and thought the only thing I can do is Yelp about it :)",1
trn_1356,"I am far from a food-snob. I am much more likely to enjoy a PB&J at home then eat at some expensive and fancy 5-star restaurant. Go ahead, call me unrefined if you must.

I took the girlfriend here to try something new. The experience was cool but I didn't particularly get enthused by the food. It wasn't bad... it just wasn't to my liking. With that said, the GF liked it. We ordered the bruschetta which was totally different. You actually pick 4 flavors out of 6 flavors - mix and match how you like. The flavors were not what I was expecting. We got the  Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone; House Made Ricotta, Heirloom Tomatoes and Basil Vinaigrette; Tenderbelly Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese; and the Prosciutto, House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey. The prosciutto was by far the most ""normal"" of the bunch in my opinion. The tenderbelly bacon jam one was interesting - like a smoky, meat, jelly concoction that really didn't make sense to my tastebuds but was still good. The pistachio one felt like I was eating a gooey trailmix blend on a piece of bread. Again, not bad but just not my style. Maybe someone who likes the finer things in life would enjoy them more than I did. Your mileage may vary and I think I would have enjoyed the bowl of olives more.

I ordered the brazilian steak and the GF ordered the watermelon salad. For mine the brazilian steak was, again, different. It was more like a raw beef hamburger than a steak. Very flavorful but I could have used it less juicy/messy than it was. Still good. I'd get it again. The GF loved her salad.

In general I kind of want to give it a 3 star review. It just wans't anything that wowed me. However, I feel like I walked into someplace that I knew was different and I got what I thought I was going to get... something different. I can't knock a place for doing what they do any more than I can knock McDonalds for not being a 5-star restaurant. For what it aims to be I think it does a very good job at. I'm not hankering to go back but if the GF wants to go back then I'd like to try something different there...

... maybe the Queen Creek Olives, Italian Flatbread, Salmon, or vintage Burger.",1

The price was reasonable. So reasonable that I would recommend going a size up because their flavors do change on a daily basis so if you love a flavor it might not be there tomorrow. Which just means you will have to try something new.

trn_1371,"Hello!  I have no respect for Dr. Dalley and her staff. I read the reviews. One review brought tears to my eyes. I hope that you let others know your story so that others will not have to experience what you went through. I am letting my voice be head because other women told me that I should share this with others.  Dr. Dalley was my doctor then and thank God never again. I  remember my (first pregnancy). I was feeling strange. I called the office, to let the nurse know that something did not feel right. I was sent to have blood work done and something else. The Dr, told me that I am having an e-topic pregnancy and that I am to go to the hospital and that she would meet me there. I took her advice she did the surgery. Years past and once again I was pregnant for the (second time). I started feeling strange again, I call the office, spoke to the nurse not the Dr the nurse. I was sent  for test and guess what  another e-topic pregnancy took place another tube removed. Dr. Dalley told me after the surgery that she removed the other tube successfully and there is no chance of getting pregnant again, which I already new. I went home to recover from the e-topic pregnancy (the Fallopian tube removed). One week later I tell my mom that something does not fill right. I said; (mom I think that I am still very pregnant). I called the office spoke with the nurse and told the nurse that I believe that I am still pregnant and that my breast feel and look pregnant. The nurse puts me on hold, (she is talking to the nurse). The nurse comes back to the phone, I say; (I want to speak to Dr. Dalley). The nurse say; (Dr. Dalley) wants you to go and have blood work done right away so I did with my mother. ( The nurse tells me that (you need to go to the hospital and Dr. will meet you there. I ask for a pregnancy  test and the test came back 100% that I was pregnant. The Dr. finally arrives and says to me I really don't know what happen. I say to her ( what did you take out)? (You told me that you took my tube), ( you said that I could not get pregnant). ( I had to be cut open again) for the same procedure just after one week of surgery!!!!!!!!!! I could have died. Please to all the women  (PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR  BODY). One more thing About fourteen years later I had surgery from another Dr. and guess what. I still had a Fallopian tube inside of me that Dr. Karen Daily said she removed.",-1

My party of four came on a Saturday lunch at around 12 pm and had to wait quite a bit for a table, but once we were seated, everything ran smoothly. I ordered the Walnut Street crepe and my friends ordered the classic French toast, Ottawa crepe and Tivoli crepe. My friend also ordered the Turkish coffee. The Walnut crepe was very sweet and filling; the texture of the crunch and the soft crepe were complimentary. I tasted the other dishes as well and will praise the savory crepes! I wished I had gotten that instead. 
The Turkish coffee was a bit odd though. At the bottom the coffee grinds were left behind and they looked like dirt and tasted sooo bitter! We've never had a Turkish coffee so maybe that's the style? It was amusing trying to taste the grinds and figure out what to do with it.
Overall it was a good experience. The food was fairly priced and tasted incredible! I would just come at a better time so our wait would not be so long.",1

I didn't notice the charge until after I returned the car. I called the customer care department and was told that someone would get back with me within 72 hours. What a joke! After waiting a week I called back and was read a scripted answer by a call center agent that told me I initialed for the coverage.

I like to get their item that has the salmon and roasted veggies.  This is my favourite dish here.  I have not tried any deserts here though.  I bet they are good too.  Today was nice because they sat us in the area in the back that can be closed for privacy.  That is great since we talk business a lot and it is nice to have that privacy.

I would've done it myself or taken it elsewhere, but I was running tight on time so I wanted to take it to ""professionals"" to do it for me. Once the total came, it was almost $70. I had to remind them about the 8$ he had mentioned. He decided to give me $10 off.

We will definitely come back.",1

Due to internal issues they had to call and reschedule; as a result the owner came to do the cleaning and she did an amazing job.  I was comfortable leaving midway through the job.  She was prompt, professional, thorough.  At my request she was happy to use some of my preferred products.  She took her time to leave my house sparkling clean. 
I've not had the best luck since moving here finding responsive providers.  I'd call GreenMaid again.",1

Yogurt chicken abound! V good for options. V good naan. V fresh. V not dry.  

There is butter tomato chicken (if you are in that kind of mood (hungry for butter tomato)). Rice very available. Spoons to get food from the buffet if you don't feel like using your hands. Up on their sneeze guard game. Hard. The latest models and whatnot. Also, only the dankest most relevant Indian pop music always spinning the latest hits. Hard to not dance while eating. Very nice people serving. Indian and whatnot.",1

Does not come with wash but what can you expect, $8!

Will def come back",1

They have a good menu and tons of drinks. Even loved the peanut butter and jelly hamburger. 

I love too that it's so large with a large balcony. 

Sometimes the food is hit or miss to be honest (didn't like the pictures brunch toast or their fried chicken sandwich) but it's a fun spot anytime of the day with a great beer selection.",1

The rolls here are tasty as are the cooked items. The hand rolls especially were done right, bursting with ingredients other than rice. 
And for some reason the sweet and sour chicken was out of this world.
I probably would prefer doing lunch rather than dinner even though no sashimi, just because it's way more reasonable.",1
trn_1415,"We recently got our granite from here. We initially walked in and met with a sales person. We got the quote and found the tier/style. Everything go a little messy after they came to template our house. They forgot a whole section from the quote even though we gave them the dimensions of everything. The told us the quote would be more than double the original.

Once my wife met with them, they did cut us a deal increasing from the quote an additional $500, roughly 12%. The day the installers came, they were late even though we were the first and only job for the day. I called and asked why and I was told ""traffic."" Apparently there was traffic at 9:00 in the morning on the Beltine to that takes 1.5 hours to get through. When I called to voice my disappointment, I didn't receive a call until two days later.

The install went well but there was some damage to the dry wall. It would have been nice to know this in advance. Also, the grooves they cut to support the breakfast bar were also too wide. There was no precision work so it looks sloppy when you look underneath the breakfast bar.

If you're just looking to put in granite to sell your house or don't care about the quality of the work, go here. Otherwise, I'd recommend going somewhere else.",0

trn_1417,"I'm on the fence about this place...first off, ti's the only Land Rover dealer in Vegas, which means they don't have to compete with anyone.  (Believe me, in the car buying process, you want the dealerships to have a little competition.)

I've been working with Rex, who has been helpful, but the negotiation process is not as expected.  Rex explained to us that they simply do not go below MSRP.  I found this very odd, so I started doing a little research.  TrueCar (who uses real data points from actual car purchases) shows that Land Rover sales nationwide are often below MSRP.  Furthermore, I called a few dealership in So Cal and they assured me that there is definitely room to negotiate. 

Before sharing this information, I talked to my sales guy and told him I really needed him to work with me...he ""had to call his manager at home"" to get me the discount, and told me that this is the best deal he's seen on this model of car.  

Fine.  It is still not an impressive deal.  

I spent a half day at the Lincoln dealership in Henderson (AWESOME place by the way), who gave me a SMOKIN' deal, including 2 years of service (oil changes and all!) as well as...wait for it...free car washes for life. WHAT?!  

But...I still like the Evoque better than the MKC.  So now, I'm torn.  I'd prefer to choose a company who is willing to work with me on price and actually cares about giving their customers a great deal.  The Land Rover dealer seems a little ""too cool for school,"" and not really interested in helping me getting a great deal in a car I'll be happy in.

For the record - Rex is a really nice guy, I just like it when it seems like the car salesman is in my corner and is going to bat for me - even if it's all a sham.",0

If you want to dance till you can't anymore this is the place to go to. The mix lounge is in the hotel. It closes until 4am. It's great. The only thing I disliked about my room was that it was to dark, so if your curtains were closed you totally felt like you were in a dungeon.",1

The checkin service was the WORSE checkin experience of my life! The lady was like as dumb as a box of rocks! You know every single time I've checked into a hotel I've been told ""2 nights with a King"" or whatever. Nope. This lady! I get to my room, 2 doubles! Gotta go back and move to another dang room! 
I get a the very last room in a hall. What happens? My key doesn't work! I call to tell her it doesn't work! She says well you gotta come back and get a new key! WTF?!?!?
I take that long a** walk AGAIN! 
The cafe food sucks and the service is HORRIBLE! Server knew absolutely NOTHING about the menu! I ask, is the ribeye bone-in or boneless??? ""Ummm I don't know, I have to ask"".....I ask if the calamari is strips or rings, tentacles??? ""Im not sure, I will ask!!!!"" What kind of management runs this awful place?!?! Room service!!!! Omfg! You gotta be kidding me!!!! Lady on the phone is also an air head! NOBODY in this ENTIRE place knows anything about what they're selling! 
This is the WORSE hotel EXPERIENCE of my life!!!!! I want my money back! I want every single penny! I know that will more than likely not happen, but GEEZUZ!!!!!! What a waste! Lesson learned, I will never cheat on the Palms Place again to experiment with something else! Ridiculous! 
Oh and that $16.99 per night fee for using my pillows on my bed! Are you flipping kidding me?!?! And a free mermaid show that anyone can watch other than hotel guests! What a joke!!!!!!",-1

trn_1426,"I met up with my husband here for lunch. The first time we came here there were only two customers. Everything on the menu looks good and the prices are reasonable. My husband ordered the corned beef panini  with a side dish of potato salad and a drink. I ordered the turkey avocado panini with a side dish of potato salad and a drink. We also ordered the Thai salad to go for later. Our panini were made to order and the ingredients were fresh. They were both really tasty and the potato salad complimented our panini. The Thai salad is a great portion and was fresh. We ended up going again for the second time in one week because it was good and we wanted to try something else on the menu. The second time around my husband ordered the turkey avocado panini and I had the triple decker club. Our sandwiches were fresh and prepared nicely. This time the place was packed. All tables were taken except for one and we were just in time to grab a table. We got to have a chat with the owner and he was a very pleasant guy. Great staff, great customer service, and delicious food.",1
trn_1427,Such a cute diner! Love that the parking is huge and it is so close to the strip! I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and it was amazing. If you ever want to grab a bite after leaving the club this is the place they have so many selections and the staff is super friendly!,1
trn_1428,"This place was just OK. The server, Braden, was great. In spite of being very busy, he was attentive and friendly. I ordered the house made potato chips with blue cheese sauce for the table. I guess I had envisioned crispy chips with a side of dipping sauce. Instead, the chips were smothered in the sauce, which made them soggy. The ones at the bottom were like mush. We left half the order uneaten. A friend ordered the calamari and it was utterly flavorless. For a main, I ordered a pizza. I was expecting a WG wood fired pizza to be amazing. Instead, it was simply average. I'd asked for it to be a bit crispy, and if anything, it was soggy in the middle. The wolfgang puck Sauvignon blanc was too sweet for my liking. The people I was with were more satisfied with their meals than I was, but nobody was blown away.",-1

trn_1436,"We came to Wolfgang Pucks on July 25th, 2015 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of my two dearest friends. We were a party of five, not a large party but it was not the norm. We had several needs that required special attention and accommodation. One of our guests was using a wheelchair for an injury so we required a larger area for him to maneuver around during the meal and we brought with us two bottles of our own champagne to toast the Anniversary couple. We had inquired earlier in the day about a possible corking fee for the champagne and our hotel made the reservation for us via the hotel Concierge. We made our way from our hotel to the restaurant, and from the minute we entered we treated like celebrities. Our waiter was named Robert and I can say, without a doubt, that this young man made the entire evening unforgettable. He shared with us a little about his family and his personality was so comforting and welcoming. The staff that worked alongside of Robert paid attention to every single detail. Robert made certain that our orders were correct. His staff working alongside of him made sure that water glasses were NEVER empty. Our champagne glasses will always FULL and our food was spectacular. Our bread baskets were always full too.  He did not miss a beat in his service. He knew the balance of helping his guests and also giving us time to enjoy our meal with our friends as we celebrated. He treated the Anniversary couple like royalty. He made sure they were noticed and recognized. He made certain the entire experience was completely enjoyable. Our appetizers were tasty and just as described on the menu. Our entrees were served hot and to point. No long wait either. As soon as our dinner was complete, Robert came out with two special desserts for the anniversary couple giving them the spotlight. and makingit a night to remember. I can't express strongly enough how spectacular his service was. Robert was sincere, attentive and his personality was so memorable that we , as an entire group, will never forget him. We came visiting from Los Angeles with no expectations at all but he exceeded every goal of great service. Not only that but Robert also took it upon himself to discount a portion of our meals in celebration of the Anniversary couple's special day, as well as comping us the corkage fee. Who does that? If you want a great meal -- and the food was SPECTACULAR so thank you to the chef -- and exemplary service and an all around enjoyable dining experience then make your way to this location. It is an experience you will not regret. I want to take the time to thank the entire staff at Wolfgang Pucks for their hard work and dedication to us, the customers.  We felt like we were family and even better, we felt like we were VIP's from the way we were treated. I come to Las Vegas usually every year and I have been quite a few times over the years and have NEVER experienced such GREAT service from any restaurant or it's staff. This was beyond belief. It's been a couple of weeks and people I talk to are almost tired of hearing me speak on how great this place is. Thank you again for making this a night of all nights and one hell of an unforgettable experience. Robert, thank you so much for all you did to make this night special for my friends anniversary but most of all thanks for sharing a little of yourself with us. It was a pleasure. And to the management of Wolfgang Puck's, don't let Robert get away. He is a treasure you should value because service like that is RARE!!!! Great place, great food and GREAT experience.",1
trn_1437,"So this is only my opinion and what transpired while dining here.  I called and made reservations for 7:00pm on a Friday evening.  My wife and I arrived at 7 on the dot and were immediately seated.  We were there 20 seconds when our waitress rushes over and apologizes for making us wait.  20 seconds?  We ordered drinks, which came quickly, then we ordered appetizers and the main course.  My wife had calamari, which was to die for, and I had oysters on the half (great choice).  We both ordered surf and turf and the steak and the lobster was done to perfection.  A little free dessert for my birthday and a round of applause from the fellow dinners capped it off.
Service was excellent, food was really good and the atmosphere was comfortable.  Plus, since I'm from NYC the prices were reasonable for what we had.
Would we dine here again?  Every time we visit Pittsburgh it's a must!",1
trn_1438,"I held off visiting M's due to some early negative reviews but I saw none of those negatives on my recent first-time visit.  Excellent food, varied menu, prompt and courteous service.  Another reviewer here claimed they had detailed descriptions of their rolls -- I didn't see such descriptions but at this stage of my sushi journey the lack of descriptions isn't a big problem.  Everyone has calamari appetizers but they aren't always well done.  M's are spot-on in taste, texture and presentation.  Salmon rolls and tuna rolls were great.  I must have been there during Happy Hour though I didn't see any indications of what those hours were but I was there by myself and it wouldn't have made a huge difference anyway.  I'll just say it was a very enjoyable meal for a reasonable price.  I could do without the TV's and the sports channels.  It invites calls and hoots from the audience, particularly the bar area.  But it's really hard to get away from that trend.  There are many really good sushi restaurants in this neighborhood so it's hard to give an accurate rank.  But M's is definitely in my top 5.  My location when the sushi urge hits me will be the deciding factor.",1
trn_1439,"We came in for lunch here. The restaurant has two levels. We we're group of 9 adults and a kid. The place was pathetic. We were not given napkins or silverware.

Would not recommend this place for service or food!",-1

10 tables 4 were occupied including our party of four. 

It took 40 minutes for our order to come and it didn't all come at the same time. Only one of the orders came. Which left the other 3 staring at walls. 

The other orders came within the next 15 minutes one at a time 10 minutes apart. 

Our appetizers came after two of my friends finished their lunch. One of my friend cancelled his order because he ate our left over food.

trn_1444,"Decided to trek off my beaten path and try a different (yet nearby) Anytime Fitness. I usually go to the Huntersville location, which, from what I understand, is larger and has more equipment than most Anytime Fitness locations. Keep that in mind. 

When I entered this location just prior to noon on a weekday, it was completely empty except for an employee (possibly the owner). I attempted a head-nod as a greeting but was ignored. No big deal. Here to workout. 

The free weight area is a little small, but they do have ample equipment for a full workout. The treadmills seem to be the best part because they face large windows that overlook a small road with trees in the background (better than no trees).

Unless I'm mistaken, there are two unisex bathrooms. One of them had a leak on the floor when I was there (it was not from me taking a leak on the floor). 

Two other interesting aspects about this experience were the 90s rap music and TruTV on the television monitor. I don't like rap anymore, but I did at that time. TruTV was playing Impractical Jokers, which I love, but it also made me realize that everyone knows who they are by now (if it's playing at an Anytime Fitness on Prospect Road in Highland Park NC). They really need to hit other countries to keep it fresh. Slightly off-topic, but a justifiable detour. 

The likelihood of someone determining whether or not to join this gym based on my review is low. I just like to write. btw, there were three people in there when I left.",1
trn_1445,"Naturoll has gotten a serious amount of hype, and I was excited to try it on a hot day in July. My husband and I went on a weekday afternoon, so we didn't have to endure the long lines that people experience at night and on the weekends.

The concept of rolled ice cream is fun, but the final product didn't impress me as much. It was tasty but very cold and very icy. The pretty appearance of the ice cream sacrificed some of the flavor. I would take less attractive, creamy, decadent ice cream over this icy variety.

Fun experience but I would be a bit disappointed if I had waited in a super long line.",0
trn_1446,"Oh Galleria, for a time you were my secret lover as it were, the place I could escape to in the lonely, semi-industrial Dupont/Dufferin area.  What other mall in the city boasts a Zellers, Toronto's oldest sports bar (P.M. Toronto), an LCBO and an off-track betting establishment?  No one, that's who!  

The main reason I used to venture out to the Galleria with my housemates was to hit up the Price Chopper for a regrettable afternoon of grocery shopping.  Occasionally the pharmacy there would do in a pinch to grab some cough syrup or bandaids, and of course the LCBO so close by was a plus as well.  The cast of characters who inhabit this mall seem like they could be Canadian versions of the cast of Little Britain - colorful and nearly impossibly real.  

At one point my housemates and I thought it would be clever to stop into the ""mall bar"", PM Toronto, and lo and behold we discovered cheap, cheap drinks and a half decent menu!  Plus? Hot nut machine.  Not bad for a trip to the mall.

Overall though I'd avoid this place if ever possible - there are too many scammy seeming booths, wig sellers, collectible card vendors, soccer jersey shops and other weird merchants which come as quickly as they disappear.  This place is due a makeover as of maybe 5 years ago, although I guess they are sort of the downmarket noncompetitor to Dufferin mall, so maybe their patrons like it just the way it is...but probably not.",-1

trn_1448,"Visited for lunch on a Saturday morning, July 7, 2012 (sorry, long overdue review!)

Open 24 hours? Check.
""Interesting"" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check.
American-sized portions? America, Fuck Yeah -- CHECK.
Indoor firepit? Check.

As Damon H mentions, the food is ""surprisingly very good.""  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.

The wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)",1
trn_1449,"Due to a miscommunication my fiance and I ended up unexpectantly staying here. 
The staff was friendly and welcoming. The lobby smelled gorgeous, I couldn't pin point where the nice aroma was coming from but it was some sort of freshener/perfume. It was lovely.
Our hotel room was very spacious and ample.  The beds and the pillows were to die for. I swear I gotta an amazing nights sleep which hasn't been my case since wedding planning. Perhaps it had to do with me insisting I sleep in the additional bed so we could both ""sprawl out like animals"".  The accommodations were more than sufficient and I really appreciated the easy access to ice machines, vending machines, and water. The shower was marvelous and the free toiletries they provided were Aveda brand which was rad.

Definitely a hotel I would recommend to anyone from out of town wanting to stay in the east end area.",1
trn_1450,"If you go antique shopping in Las Vegas or Boulder City you will tend to find that most stores are expensive and stocked for women who collect dolls, glass, and vintage clothes (nothing wrong with those but the husband was less than impressed). Goatfeathers is not like this.

Goatfeathers has various sections made up of different people's collection of wares for sale. The trick is finding that particular area that speaks to your interest. If you want to find something very specific talk to the staff - if you are waiting to be inspired walk around and wander. 

Highlights 
-Old beer/alcohol labels and crate labels for .75 a piece great for decoupage
-Tiny old medicine/alcohol bottles for around $3-5 a piece for jewelry making 
-Keys for $3 a piece that will be turned into jewelry 
-Antique bullwhip for my husband for $35 (Paid a little much for a non working condition one, but it was so cool like an Indiana Jones whip I couldn't resist
-The place is clean, the items are clean, and nothing has that antique funk smell

Most likely if you are  a diligent etsy/ebay buyer you will find things cheaper than Goatfeathers. For tourists from actually older parts of the country you will find cheaper prices where you come from. For a market which is historically marked up for tourists and lacks many antiques due to the recent history of the area this is a great antique store and my husband and I plan on going back.",1

* Hangar steak: 4/10 would never get this again. The meat looked to be perfectly medium rare, but it was cold and dry and shriveled up when I ate it - as if it had been sitting out for a while.
* Spoon bar: 8/10 great dessert - I love chocolate mouse and there were nice crunchy bits on top and the cookie bottom also kept things textually interesting.",1

trn_1457,"We have flown on Allegiant many times to Las Vegas and Phoenix.  Yes, you do get what you pay for.  Yes, they do frequently have delays, etc.  But, if you shop, and you don't have a super tight schedule, you can save a lot of money.  We never pay for any of the extras like an assigned seat, priority boarding, etc.  They don't over book their flights so you will get a seat.  Most of their flights aren't that terribly long and they are direct, so why does it matter where you sit.  Get to the airport early and get an early open boarding number and you won't have a problem.  Many of the times we have flown, the flights have been right on time.  A few times we have had MAJOR delays like in the 6 hour range, but over all it's not anything to get that worked up about.  I always check their prices, and if it's cheap when I want to fly, I don't hesitate.",0

trn_1459,"We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.  

All in all, a really nice meal!",1

bad part:  they have a wooden walkway to walk closer to the falls, but you can't just go down by the water.

trn_1465,"I bought a groupon for the 50 mink eyelash extensions for like $25 which is SOOOO cheap for mink eyelashes. I think most of the customers that come here bought a groupon because it's so cheap haha! So initially I couldn't find the place until I walked into a building with multiple stores. I remember reading that the office is located on the second floor so I took the elevator up and lo and behold, it's right beside the elevator!

I was greeted by the receptionist who I believe is Jenny as others have mentioned here. She took my groupon and seated me. The office is small, but clean. I was put into a room where I was put into a bed under a blanket, like they tucked me in as if I were going to sleep lol. Annyways, I got comfy and I believe the assistant did my lashes. She asked me what type of style I wanted and I went for the natural lash look. She explained the procedure step by step and was really clear what she was going to do. The natural look uses a mix of 8mm and 14 mm lashes as I wanted them to be a little bit longer.

The procedure:
You lie down onto a bed and the asthetician tapes down your lower lashes and the eye lid area. The whole time your eyes will be shut. She carefully glued each lash onto my real lashes and the procedure took about an hour. 

After she was finished, I waited 10 minutes for the glue to dry but then Jenny (I think) came in and took a hair dryer and told me to hold it to make the glue dry faster, like some other yelpers said. It was a little weird but it seemed that she needed me out of the room so that the next client could go in. After 5 minutes of blow drying, I tried to open my eyes and OMG, IT STUNG. I was in tears, I COULD NOT OPEN MY EYES. The glue had NOT dried yet and I had to walk out of the room. I couldn't open them and the assistant led me out of the room while I was still tearing. I sat down in the waiting area with the eyes closed until the stinging stopped which was like for another 15 minutes. The stinging was actually pretty bad since it even made my nose run. 

As for the lashes itself, I LOVE THEM - they look really good. The natural look isn't really natural but rather non-dramatic. It looks more like dolly lashes (sorry, I'll post pictures soon!). The lashes are noticeable and pretty. 

For maintenance, you're not allowed to put on mascara or curl them (you won't need to anyways!). You MUST NOT use an oil base face cleanser or makeup remover. You can use eyeshadow and eyeliner, but the liner can only be above the lash line or only on the edge of your eyes. The lashes should last for around 3-5 weeks but I'll give an update later to see if these lashes are glued properly. 

As mentioned by a few others, Jenny does get up frequently as she is also the receptionist. She was with another client but she went up the receiptionist desk to charge me the tax (~$4.50). So if you do get her, you will not get her full attention.

Overall, I really do love my lashes and I had an okay experience unlike others. Apart from the glue stinging my eyes for about half an hour after the procedure, I do think $30 is a good deal. I would come back to do a refill until I can find better places that will wait for the eyelash glue to dry!",0
trn_1466,"Walgreens, the giant, the evil empire, and the villain of the pharmacy world. As an employee of this company, I've seen the worst of their motives which is the bottom line. They claim to be champions of wellness, and compassion but they are anything but. Everything from the  snooty pharmacists and technicians, to the photo shop geeks, and the maniacal eyed makeup lady this drug store chain in the ultimate FAIL. I don't think CVS is any better, but the point is, these big pharmacy companies have replaced decent customer service with bottom lines, turning their stores into mechanical factories that want to get customers in and out as fast as they can. Their slogan is "" Be Well"" and you will almost always hear it from their employees, but it's sort of odd coming from a pharmaceutical distributor who's soul reliance is for you to NOT be well. Furthermore, they pay their beloved employees garbage, are so strict and hard in their employees it seems they took a page right out of the Chinese business ethic...work them to the bone, I've them no leeway, and pay as minimum as possible because hey; these people are desperate for jobs anyway. In closing, I recommend staying away from these large chain pharmacies in favor of grocery store pharmacies where they know you on a first name basis, they are less crowded, and many times just as cheap.",-1

trn_1470,"I was dying to come here after passing it by in Vancouver. I had never been able to go and then my friend's girlfriend told me about this place. She wouldn't stop raving about it and after finding out that they established a bar here, my mind was made up and a impromptu date night was formed.
At first, I was a little skeptical. From the outside, it didn't look open and gotta say, it felt a little sketchy to say the least. With such a plain exterior, it gave me second thoughts thoughts and I was stalling a bit (it was next to a roti shop with half my last name - I was distractingly excited about that). Walking in through the big curtains though, the atmosphere was completely different. The decor was very overwhelmingly loud. With all the kitschy trinkets, straw hut booths, barrel tables, tiki figures and masks, the bar gave a whole distinct experience in itself.
After gazing at all the little nooks and crannies of the place, my boyfriend and I managed to order the mystery bowl. What a perfect startup drink! A combination of rum, spices and juices with a touch of a gong to announce its arrival. The drink itself went down smoothly although I didn't taste the spices that they were mentioning. It made us want more, not to mention that drink disappeared within seconds. We became curious about the voodoo bowl and the volcano bowl - this one was presented by a change in lights and atmosphere to resemble an erupting volcano complete with fog and smoke coming out the stairs. We made a mental note to come back with more people as those bowls have been suggested to try with at least four people instead of two.
Our snacks to start consisted of their chips with guacamole and their Maui coconut shrimp. The guacamole was very nice and smooth. I honestly eat a lot of guacamole whether it be from Tex-Méx restaurants or bars. I even went to Mexico and purposefully avoided guacamole with nachos for a while because I was starting to get sick of it. But this guacamole is bringing me back on the bandwagon for sure!
The Maui coconut shrimp were to die for, however I feel like we were skimped on the portions. There was only three of them which weren't enough. There should be more considering the shrimp were of average size. The chips portion seemed to contain a lot more food.
The tiki burger is a must try here. Their sliders are a good thirst quencher for the food but this is the real deal. Eating this burger will leave you pretty satisfied. I have never had pineapple on a burger before but it created a good balance. It made the burger have a sweet sort of tang in every bite. Definitely made this burger above average. This is served with fries which, bonus, I dipped them in everything. I started with the ketchup that they gave me, moved to finish off our second bowl of guacamole - yes, it was that good - and then dipped them in the honey plum sauce that came with the coconut shrimp. Sounds a little weird but it came with good results. All were good, all separate add ons to this meal. 
My favourite thing on their menu has to be their taco al pastor. They only come served as one so order multiple if you wish and they come in three options. I decided to get the kalua pork taco. Man oh man, was that good! They didn't shy on the pork which is how they won my heart. Most places I go, they give you the minimum ingredients but this place was great about the portion here.
I also decided to top up with the black velvet cocktail. With hints of cherry and lime, this drink packs a strong punch. I'm not really a rum drinker, I'm more of a Russian vodka kind of girl but this drink was rather good and smooth. Make sure you mix the cocktail up though. The coffee with the rum gives a kick on its own so the less of a stir, the bigger the kick. Not my top choice for drinks but it was good for the occasion. They have a legend with this drink menu for most of their drinks - excludes the bowls - so it can help you gauge them with your tolerance. They are described in barrels which was an amusing touch and go from one (mild) to five (you're a damn trooper). I am stubborn so I didn't actually pay attention to it but as an indication, if you are not used to rum, stick to two or less. Or you can work your way up, starting with one barrel and see how you go. 
Something to keep in mind is that they do not have any desserts. If you go and their menu is not updated, don't ask the server about their desserts. They had stopped making them a while back but the reason is unknown. 
This is a bar, I would definitely go back to and this time with a couple more people. I think this place is best for a group because of the sheer festivity of it. Probably a good end of the school year celebration would do? This can also work as a funky first date. ;)",1

Everyone we have talked with at this facility is so informative and we love their calm energy that they bring to this wild member of our family!  Their facilities are bar none, the very best.  Immaculate and comfortable accommodations for Kato when we need to leave him while traveling.  And it is so nice to continue our training during this time.  When it cools we will have to sign up and continue to the next level.  This group is worth every $ that they charged us. Our first visit just watching how calm he was, while they explained their program, was very impressive.  He responded to their calm, gentle way of doing things immediately.  We were so impressed!  We were really relieved to leave him and like most canine parents, scared!  We really overact with our darlings!  Can't wait until the weather heat leaves us and we can sign up for more classes.

trn_1493,"Finally decided to give this place a try thanks to the purchase of a groupon which made it a pretty great deal but overall I think the prices are a little high for the environment. It is a really tight space that doesn't feel comfortable or inviting at all. They had it decorated in a cool way but that just barely helped it not to feel like we were in a fast food joint. I think they should reconfigure the space and turn it into an order at the counter style where you just grab some tacos and a bucket of beer an head out to the patio (like America's) or take a lunch to go.

We both ordered items that I am pretty sure they have on their menu at the Bistro. Hubby got the pasta which was delicious (yes, I stole a bite) and I ordered the shredded pork torta which was also delicious. Sweet potato fries were yummy with good seasoning on them but unfortunately a bunch had gotten stuck together and formed some kind of mass which was a bit unappetizing. I guess that happens but I don't think they should have served them like that.

I called before hand and a girl answered who said they had a charger that would work for my Traxxas battery. Sweet, I swing by and then ask for a charger, the girl I spoke with grabs the charger and rings me up. As I'm checking out I confirm it works with my battery and she says yes, but you need an adapter... I respond OK can I grab one of those too, she then responds with we won't have any until this Friday (it's currently Sunday). At this point I don't want the charger when I can buy it for the same price on Amazon and get an adapter before Friday. She then tells me, I've already run your card, but let me see what I can do. She then turns to an older man and asks what she can do. He tells her to return it if we don't have the correct adapter. After some time of her looking if she can Jerry rig one, she finds a used one and the older man says go ahead and sell it to him. Sweet, everything is working out, I hand her my card again and she says, do you have cash?, I reply maybe in my car, so I run out and grab $20 then come back in. I hand her the cash and she says i don't know if I have change, at this point I just want to leave so I say give me what you have and I'll be fine.

I have since called there 3 times for popular parts I needed and not once did they have them in stock. Overall It felt like an awkward transaction and no parts on hand, so I won't be back.",0
trn_1501,"We have to set the record straight about what's original. Chris Bianco had his first wood fired oven in Town and Country on 20th st and Camelback. He was young and passionate and his pizza was sublime. I never really understood his move downtown but it worked out for him, at least in the fame department. We found it too difficult to be loyal followers at the Adams location with the long waits and lousy parking. The pizza was excellent, but the hype about it being ""the best"" was a distraction, and like all such titles is debatable and temporary.
The operation has expanded to 2 eateries and returned to almost the same spot in Town and Country and   we think it's darned good. The service is attentive and the menu is appealing. We prefer it for a late lunch outside, but that might just be an age factor. I miss the good old days listening to Chris extoll the virtues of fresh mozz to my culinary son,but today's version is still solid fare",1
trn_1502,"To keep this simple: I think this place has the best bang for your buck. There are some places in Vegas that charge $20+ for a drink and you can't hardly taste the booze. This place certainly makes sure you walk away - literally, cuz no one cares if you walk around with a sealed Fat Tuesday drink in Vegas - with a buzz. The drinks taste good, they're strong, and they're actually pretty reasonably priced. And the staff was really friendly, which was refreshing, because I'm sure they are dealing with thousands of annoying drunk people all day and that can test your friendliness level pretty quickly. I don't know why we didn't visit this place the last time we went to Vegas, but we're definitely coming back!",1

The cook can not figure out sausage should be a part of a breakfast sandwich that has sausage on it.

The other employee, was very angry at herself, I believe she even head butted the wall. I would steer clear of at all possible, unless you like torment and anguish.",-1

Located on Stephen Avenue, I must say is a beautiful restaurant creating a beautiful dine in experience. Although, we were thoroughly displeased with the food and the service. We had the meetball appetizer which came out slightly cold. For my main, I had ordered the Chuck burger which had very smoky aftertaste to it. My husband and our friend had orders drinks which sat on the counter for a while before our server decided to bring them over to us, which occurred twice. Once again, gorgeous restaurant, food was ok, a tad bit overpriced..don't think I'd be going back..not for us.",-1

Excellent food.  Oh my gosh, the Salbutes are AMAZING.  Think, truly awesome taco w/boiled chicken and (odd, but it totally works) parmesan cheese.  Not much to look at, but the FLAVOR!
The short ribs are melt in your mouth delicious, and not overcooked (a lot of places they overcook them, and they sort of dry out, even though they're swimming in juices, but not here).
So, so, so good.  We will be back.",1

My husband went for a date night and besides the quiet atmosphere and friendly staff, we were not very impressed. 
My husband's lobster was good, however my king crab legs were fishy tasting and the texture was a little weird. The rice and vegetables had less seasoning than a retirement home. We ordered calamari and it was pretty good, and the bread was decent too. 
I feel bad for the staff that they have to serve

The chicken was so juicy and the skin was not to crispy but just right. Comes with spiced watermelon and a biscuit. The mac and cheese tasted like bland cheese. Not southern at all but it was okay. The drinks were well done and just right. Seating is up high and cozy. Great place to eat alone, with family, or friends. Its right off the strip. The place is clean, comfortable, reasonable. At one point the waitress accidentally filled my friends vodka with water (it was so funny) but they were apologetic and replaced it free of charge. The people here are genuinely friendly and great at customer service and quality food. Highly Recommended

-Can take parties as large as 8-10 ppl
- Dress Manhattan Chic/ Business Casual

The shape and colour was all wrong! =( Tiffany was able to improve my shape and colour by using the combination technique (microblading + microshading) and now I get so many compliments on my eyebrows. She definitely is a perfectionist and I am glad she took the time to measure and design my eyebrows until I was happy with them before she microbladed. 

Also, I would like to comment on the shop itself. It is a very clean and spacious place. It is nicely decorated and they even serve Sloane Tea!

Don't be fooled by the seemingly limited menu, they can and will cook anything you want.  If they have it in the market, they will cook it for you any way you like.

My wife got 1/4 pound small shrimp fried Cajun style, and really enjoyed it.  The breading was the perfect consistency, not to thick.

I got the low country boil small plate and everything was delicious.  It comes with 10 shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage.  The seasoning was strong without taking over the dish.  Everything was cooked to perfection.

-Easier to park (but you might get stuck in some traffic due to lack of stop lights)
-Indoors so you can find some sanctuary for those hot Vegas summers (but it feels kind of claustrophobic inside)
-A lot of store selections (but I feel like the selection is much bigger at the North outlets)
-More food options compared to North outlets, including surrounding food options
-lacks that ""touristy"" vibe, so less tourists looking lost or toting their luggage

Despite the hassles of the North outlets, I still feel like I'd rather shop there. Although it was nice being indoors, it was easier to get to the main stores we wanted to go to by walking outside the building, but our trip was ultimately a bust.",-1

I showed up in tears due to first booking at the Extended stay next door. I couldn't stay there it was disgusting and I felt unsafe. I had to get out and quick. I had just flown in for the weekend and was with out a car so I lucked out by finding this place right next door. With my phone at 1% and I was with out a charger I was slightly freaking out. She got me checked in while I drank the delicious cucumber water I should of known then I was going to love my stay. Also in the lobby they have coffee and dog treats guessing they are a super dog friendly hotel while checking in she introduced me to a dog coming in from a potty break thought that was pretty sweet.  After getting me checked in she found a charger for me to borrow I told her I would sit in the lobby to charge not wanting to put her out by taking off with it but she insisted and ""take it to you room get comfortable""   The room was a nice size. I guess its a North Carolina thing to get a mini kitchen in your room I wasn't expecting nor need a full dish washer shoot I've lived in houses with out not complaining because I would if it didn't have at least a mini fridge and microwave here you get a full size fridge. The breakfast was the best free breakfast I ever had at a hotel. Lots of choice from the standard make yourself waffles to the not so standard packaged hard boiled eggs. The breakfast attendant continued to cook and bring fresh items out like the bacon and eggs and it doesn't end till 10am! Thanks for thinking of us who like sleep! The location was prefect as well, I used Lyft to get around and it was right around $10 to get to everywhere I went, downtown and a few breweries really close by.

In late December of 2014 the unit I had been renting for about a year was broken into, it was a 10' x 20' unit full of everything I own. They took everything, leaving broken glass and shattered remains of my life. When I came to realize this has happened I filed a police report and reached out to the facility. This is when a business should take action to make the customer feel as if they are being looked out for, this was not the case for me And PUBLIC STORAGE, the talked down to me as if I don't matter, they kept telling me to file a police report, make an insurance claim... I was not seeking counsel or advice from them, I was asking for a discount our a little credit to help me out financially till I could relocate what little was left in the unit. They answer back that credit or anything is against their policy and NO help can be given. 
Maybe I'm in the wrong but in my opinion they failed to provide a safe place to keep my personal belongings, and then treated me like I don't matter.

My fist 4 sessions were a waste of time and money.  They set the treatment too low to be effective.  It took 4 sessions of my complaining before they adjusted the treatment.

The most prominent flavor was the cheddar cheese. My only critique would be that it could use more pesto, but it was still damn good. Also, the Heart (based out of Portland, OR) coffee was delicious and was a medium brew with a light oily layer. 

The atmosphere may be just as fine as the food. The music was great and playing from an employee's iPod. I heard the Beatles, Gene Chandler, and Fela Kuti, a pioneer of Afrobeat music, among others.

I did switch the 12-grain bread for sourdough but it was melty, cheesy, crispy, spicy and ooey gooey all at the same time. Very good and will certainly order from here again!",1
trn_1561,"Hubby and I went for the first time last night. I had the chicken kabob and it was AMAZING!! The chicken was so moist and flavorful!! The salad was so fresh and tasty!! I'm not a big salad eater, but I didn't even touch my meal until every morsel of my salad was eaten up! It had such an yummy dressing and fresh chunks of quality tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese. My hubby had the pita and, to be honest, it was typical of other Greek restaurants, which is it tasted very good. Nothing really different. Hubby is going to get one of the platters next time!! He tasted mine and was quite impressed! We will definitely return often!!",1
trn_1562,We soooo wanted to like this place!  We ordered the Mac daddy with pulled chicken but no chicken.....maybe some pork or brisket....couldn't really tell. Tasted ok but was cold. Husband got the 2 meat platter to share with fries and cole slaw. The brisket was good but the pulled pork was way too salty.  The cole slaw was unusual...limp with a strange spice.  My cole slaw loving daughter didn't like it. The fries were hot and crispy!  Fries and brisket were good and the reason for 2 stars.  Don't do the cornbread....feels like you took a bite of sand.,-1
trn_1563,"Don't order to go. I ordered a to go order right when they opened. Was told 25 to 35 minutes. It took them one hour 10 minutes for s fried rice, noodle dish, and some pork buns. People who sat down were done and walking around the casino faster. Other people got thier to go orders faster. The food it tight, but the service lacks. I regret leaving a tip. They sure did not earn it.

Edit: when I got home the food was worse. Chicken fried rice was undercooked, looked like it had boilednl chicken in it, the pork buns were odd. They had sugar cookies baked into the tops? The only thing they got right was the noodles. Now my only regret is that I cant give them negative stars.",-1
trn_1564,"I wish there was a -10 star for this place. I had called to place an order and Jessyca picked up the phone very rudely!! Seriously if u can't or don't want to take orders don't hang up the phone on customers!!!! So I called back and ask for a supervisor and to my surprise he wasn't there, the owner? Oh he never comes in she said!!! So the bit.... Is all by her self answering the phone like it is her house!!!!!! Please DO NOT hire white trash people that don't know how to be polite to your customers if u still have any. Just as I posted this review the ""owner"" called me, to see if he could help me order, not to see why I was upset. I tried to explain to him what had happen and he kept insisting that she wasn't rude by hanging up the phone or asking rude questions! Seriously??!!!? And of course he hang up too, very professional people!",-1
trn_1565,"My husband and I went here for brunch today.   It was 19.99 per person plus champagne (unlimited).   We had a free voucher which is why we checked it out. I ate a little bit of everything - bacon, sausage, ribs, steak, salad, fruit, buscuits and gravy, ice cream - you get the idea.   The food, like at many buffets, was not the best but it wasn't awful.  I wanted something from the carving station but they only had one person working behind the counter who was making omelets and was not paying attention to the carving line which was growing. They have waiters that get your drinks for you who were very attentive and friendly.   I think if champagne wasn't included, the price would have been too much and not worth it.",0
trn_1566,This is scam. I call the company to fix my refrigerator because it can't produce ice and water leak. What I do is unplugged the hose at the back to stop the leak. Then I callthen I message this company to check the problem and I talk to the owner then he charge me 79.00 to chk if there is a problem he change part with my expense. I said fine. He show up in my house by 2pm I'm not home my wife is the one who talk to him. He put back the hose and turn on the water that's all he do then left. When I came home the ice maker still not working Of course because he don't do anything so I message back the owner about the problem he said . I saw the hose is not connected and the water is off maybe reason why there is no ice I said I'll take it out then you just put it back then charge me 79.00 to put it back? He don't even chk the problem. I message him and he don't answer me again he just ignore me. Please remember this company don't ever call this. Don't be a victim.,-1

trn_1571,"Stopped in to get a new phone and was dreading it. I had to get a new sim card and quickly.

I was immediately  approached by a friendly and very helpful employee. I explained that I didn't  have a lot  of time and how my past experiences never went well. 

She promised  me  that she would get me in and out in a quick manner to accommodate me. I was hopeful  yet doubtful. 

My new phone was activated and she even taught me a few things . Literally less than 5 minutes and I was ready to go!! Thank goodness!

Kassie was awesome!! Her knowledge and customer  service has restored my hope at this location. 5 stars for great customer service and efficiency!!

I highly recommend  this location for your wireless needs. Enjoy!",1
trn_1572,"The burgers here were great. Much like a burger that you would cook at a BBQ. Thick and juicy. Its an old run down bar, limited amount of seating and tables are pretty close together. It was clean inside but had that old bar feel. The service is not terrible but it wasnt the best either. One of the burgers was undercooked which the cook happily no questions asked cooked another one for us. Kudos to the cook. 
The fries were good and went amazing with the burger. It was priced decently as well. You would spend just as much if you went to Jack In The Box but you would get a fresher and better burger. 
I could only eat half the burger and I was full. The meat was great, nothing bad to say there. Its not a must to stop in, but if your a stickler for a thick juicy burger, this may fill that void!",1
trn_1573,"Fabulous salon! I am very picky when it comes to my nails and like them to look PERFECT. 
Now there was a time when my nails did not come out absolutely the way I liked it and I called to see if I can have it fixed. Cindy was super nice and apologetic that my pedicure did not look the way I liked it (I really am anal about my nails). I came in the following day and she fixed it for me. Good costumer service is really important and you will definitely get it here. Not every salon will care about their customers as much as this salon does. 
A salon with staff like this one is truly a rarity and am happy I found it.",1
trn_1574,"It was my mom's birthday we had this great weekend planned in Asheville, NC filled with food and wine -I had created an entire itinerary that I printed out. But as luck would have it her 18 year old dog got sick and we couldn't go...well the weekend was not completely ruined.  

Why not try a new restaurant in Charlotte?  LuLu has been on my list for awhile.  We walked in to a cozy little house for brunch on a Sat. around noon.  There were only a few other diners inside...we were all craving some bloody mary's.  The bloody mary's were decent nothing I would rave about but they hit the spot. Now to the food I ordered the Country Benedict - I love eggs benedict I order a version of them in just about any restaurant I go too - this was such a great combo at Lulu's Neese's breakfast sausage, jalapeno relish, fried green tomatoes I could go on and on well I will I also had grits with pimento cheese and my mom and sister had ordered french fries with aioli as there sides.  The fries were amazing with a brown sugar bourbon rub - I don't know where they came up with that but i will be back for more.

Great for brunch - will have to check out the dinner menu when I return.",1
trn_1575,"Stayed one night at this hotel and were delighted to find such a nice place so convenient to everything.  We came in by train and the walk from the station was an easy one.  The hotel is charming.  The room was the smallest one but very quiet, clean, tastefully furnished, and fine with us.   The price was very good.  The lobby is welcoming and the staff is very personable.  We met the manager in the elevator and not knowing who he was, began chatting and continued to talk once off the elevator.  Very personable, he knows the hospitality business after working many years around the country and is a true professional in the industry.
The hotel's location is a big plus.  We could walk to many attractions and restaurants, and it was an easy subway, bus or trolley ride from any part of town.  Just off the lobby is a breakfast/brunch place ""Over Easy"" which served us a wonderful breakfast at a fair price.  Worth eating there and it's right there in the building.
The staff was so friendly and we were able to check our luggage free at the desk for the day when our train left at night and we wanted to see the city.
I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.",1
trn_1576,"My and my husband our 5 kids , mom and mother in law  went to this place . We spent over $60 on dinner buying meals , salads , drinks , and a couple of sides , hummus etc... My husband asked if we can have a side of sauce the ""  tzatziki "" beacuse his  chicken wrap was kinda dry , the Girl said Sure that will be 50 cents ...


50 cents what!!! after spending $60 she was chargeing us for a 2 cent sauce , wow so cheap and the food was  dry ....",-1
trn_1577,"This wildflower store is one of my favorites to come to have breakfast. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I believe it can improve.

trn_1578,I LOVE This old school steakhouse....food is delicious!! My Only recommendations are  make a reservation and more importantly ask to not be seated in the bar area.  The noise level is over the top. It ruined my dinner.,1
trn_1579,Very nice collection of glass. Everything available at best prices around town. People are so friendly and cheerful here and always have good deals going on. Definitely recommend for all your smoking needs,1
trn_1580,"After hearing so many great things about this buffet, I finally tried it. Mainly because I was craving crab legs and shrimp.

What a disappointment. The shrimp had a slime and there were no steamed crab legs, only chilled, and those were dry and somewhat rubbery.

The entrees were less than desirable with few choices.

Dry vegetables, dry pasta, barely warm rice and well done prime rib - no choice of how it is done.

The layout of the buffet made it a little crowded; the stations were close together and made the aisle narrow. 

You may want to consider other buffets.",-1
trn_1581,"The service has been getting much better through the years.  Noticing newer wait staff, maybe that was the change needed, to have better service here.  The owner is always so sweet and personable, she always recognizes her customers and takes time to greet them personally even when they are busy.  The food is average compared to other places, definitely better than RA and Kona.  I give this place 3 stars only because there's another Japanese Restaurant down the street that just can't be beaten as their amazing food and sushi chefs speak for itself.",1
trn_1582,"This is a really strange place. It's an open lobby area with a bar on one side and a large open area on the other with a bed, bean bags, high table tops and various other low couches. There are games peppered throughout this open area and young hipsters everywhere. Never have I seen so many twenty year-olds gathered in one big place like this before! 

There's a DJ table with loud music playing but this isn't a place suited for dancing I don't think. If you are in your 20s you'll probably have a great time here just to hang out or to meet new friends. I ran into a few very cute and young 20(s) year old guys who stared at me with a way-too-friendly smile. Sorry little ones but I'm an old lady even if I might not look it.",0
trn_1583,Omg I love their iceberg wedge but I get it with chicken instead of the short rib. Somedays I crave this salad it is so tasty. You defiantly want to make reservations if you are short on time because they are always busy but you will not regret going here. I really enjoyed their hamburger also but my favorite is the wedge salad. Servers are always friendly.,1
trn_1584,"Just had quite the experience at dicks on our vacation in Vegas... Walked towards the restaurant and a lady offered us ""two free drinks"" obviously we accepted. She handed us two cards and we went right to the bar with them. Told the bartender we had the cards and all he told us was that we needed to run two separate tabs. Being in the business we totally understood because we were giving him two coupons. As we went to cash out he went to hand us a tab of $26. We ordered a side of fries and thought our beers were free so we really should have only paid $6 with tax. All of a sudden tables turned and this free drink card turned into a buy one get one free card. The bartender handled the miscommunication very poorly and gave us a great amount of attitude. We argued back and forth and when I started to ask for his manager he completely ignored me and then finally told me I could go find her myself. Luckily, the manager came right around the corner. She handled the situation very well and I was very impressed with her customer service. If we were to go back it would be because of her but unfortunately we will not be going back due to that bartender and his AWFUL customer service. Find a new job buddy, the restaurant business is not for you.",-1
trn_1585,"Service was very slow. Took at least 20 minutes to get my food when there was only one car in front of me. The girl at the drive through wasn't very friendly. 
The food was ok. Well at least the burger was good. My friend got two beef tacos and she said they were gross. Jack in the box has better tacos for a better price. They weren't with the $1.50. 
Probably won't be back to this location.",-1

trn_1587,"I'm not a fried chicken kind of gal...but my sister is and if I want to spoil her, I know where to feed her!!  Based on how many times she said ""yum"" and licked her fingers, I knew I did right by her!!  The Deviled Eggs and Mac-n-Cheese were fit for a king!!  The water melon was tasty but could have been perfection with a sprinkle of sea salt (in my opinion).  I had the farmers salad with the pulled chicken which I though was okay.  I would definitely try something else next time.  I loved that the menu was 5 pages of alcohol and 1 page of food.  I had the peach drink which was strong enough that if I had finished it I would probably need a wheelchair to get back to my car!  Holy moly!!  Our server, I wish I knew her name (adorable petit blonde with a bubbly personality) was FANTASTIC!!!  The seating is very New York, across the table from each other and squeezed in like sardines but I kinda like it :)  Great place and I will definitely bring the hubby next time!",1

You can get $100 gift card for $80! My wife and I love the flat bread pizzas here, and their homemade gelato is outstanding! I would highly recommend this place.",1
trn_1590,"I love this place. First, it's open 24 hours so I can go there to study no matter time -which is wonderful since burst of energy to study come at various points during my day. The coffee is delicious. I had a caramel latte and it was delicious and beautiful. The staff is super friendly and personable. I will say that the seating isn't the most comfortable and finding outlets for your computer is at times challenging. 
I've had coffee, baked goods and tea from here and I've enjoyed all. You will get a unique group of people depending on the time you go, but that adds to the fun and ambiance of the place. Oh, and best thing...I can study and have a beer at the same time. While some may see this as counterproductive it can help to clear the mind and reduce anxiety (my own opinion).
Definitely check this place out for coffee, studying, relaxing, or whatever. I think you'll be happy you did.",1

trn_1592,"You CANNOT go wrong here. Best find ever! 

My boyfriend (soon to be fiance) and I had been looking around at engagement rings for OVER an ENTIRE YEAR trying to find something that I liked enough to wear for the rest of my life. I had looked for so long at so many different styles, designs, the 4 C's, retailers, major chains, local jeweler chains and on and on and on it was turning into an engagement ring nightmare. So many overwhelming choices with a lot of retailers with low quality diamonds, and totally over priced settings. 

We stumbled upon this place totally on accident one day while we were driving around the north hills (we recently moved here and aren't too familiar with the area) and happened to find the Wexford Antique shops near route 19. 

I noticed the Diamond Design building immediately (right next to the antique shops), but never actually went into the store that day. As I continued to look at big name retail chains for rings later that week and had a HORRIBLE experience at a Kay Jewelers in Cranberry, I thought back to the Jewelry store that I had not gone into. 

I went the next day after work and am SO BEYOND glad that I did. It was literally the best decision I have ever made. Upon walking in I was greeted by the ONE and ONLY fabulous Alicia. She is the heart and soul of this business and KNOWS HER STUFF. She is highly qualified in gemology as well as diamond certifications. She could answer every question I asked her and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about all types of stones, settings, and diamonds.  I explained my engagement ring nightmare to her and explained to her how frustrated I was and how frustrated my boyfriend was that we could not find ANYTHING that we liked. She sat down with me, was realistic with me about budget and quality, asked and listened to things I liked and wanted and also worked with me for 2 HOURS - let me try on everything and anything in the entire store, made suggestions and always kept my budget in mind. She also told me that she would NEVER EVER let me leave her store with a diamond of low quality as the major retailers do...be weary out there! She is absolutely FANTASTIC. At the end of our 2 hour consult, (which really ended up being me just hanging out and having fun with her for 2 hours with some productive conversation), I had a ring design that I LOVED as well as the diamond of my dreams, all within my budget. Before walking in there, I didn't even think that ever would have been possible for me, as I am EXTREMELY picky, particular and endlessly have champagne tastes on a beer budget. 

When we went in for our second consult, Alicia and Chuck answered all of my boyfriend's questions and eased any hesitations he had. They also told us that we would receive a discount on custom made wedding bands as we will have purchased my engagement ring there....a definite perk of doing business with them! Needless to say, we now have a jeweler we are totally loyal to and are already planning our next pieces with them. 

The most amazing thing about this place is their hand made, beyond GORGEOUS pieces. They are incredibly high quality...so much so that even holding one of their pieces in your hand you can really tell how well it is made...with a lot of care, detail and intricacy - much different from the big chain stores. Each piece is custom and designed for you specifically, or one of a kind. 

The service here is SECOND TO NONE. I felt like I was the most important person to both Alicia and Chuck  while I was there (he is the co-owner along with Alicia and also hand makes the pieces). They made me feel like I was heard, like I was ""VIP"" level important, and like my ring truly mattered to them. They were genuinely happy and excited to create my piece. I don't think you can really ask for more in your engagement ring experience as it is something SO important and meaningful! 

All of our experiences with them have been fantastic. If you happen to find yourself going through an engagement ring nightmare like I was, do yourself a favor and get to Diamond Design. They are truly the epitome of what a jeweler should be. Shop local and family owned on this one, you will NOT be disappointed!",1

Personally I think this place is completely overpriced for the quality and content you'll experience in your visit. Children's tickets are also pretty ridiculous. 

It takes about 30-45 minutes to get through the entire aquarium. There is a tortoise exhibit and huge tanks filled with a variety of small sharks, fish, turtles, sting rays, etc.

The complimentary chips were really good, the green avocado salsa was 100x better than the red one that is served at over temperature ? Which i found strange. The server and busboy were friendly enough but they seemed overwhelmed. I ordered a glass of wine and it took about 10-15 minutes to come out. Once it came out there were chunks of cork in it so I sent it back. My second glass of wine didn't come out for at least 15 minutes after that... even our food was already out.

Lots of unique Thai dishes that are hard-to-find in Toronto. I particularly enjoyed the khai-jiaw grob. My only qualm is that there was no tiered pricing and the prices were a bit on the expensive side given the tapas portion size. All the main tapas dishes were $10 and the sides were $3.50. One would expect each dish to be priced according to the ingredients or size.",0
trn_1601,"First things first. This place has some of the best tacos ever. Generally fast service. Amazing heat. Chopped to order meat. Even a gringo menu for those less adventurous. Overall it's a great meal and reasonably priced. 

That out of the way, what the actual feck is going on with the bar and the cashiers? Every time I order a beer the ladies at the register look like I'm speaking Mandarin. They ask the bartender. They never key in the right thing. It's a mess. Tonight I read the name of a beer off of the ""todays drafts"" list and the bartender looked like I asked for his dead puppy. They didn't have that beer. That was listed on the list of today's beers. 

I really love the food here. It's seriously a place I bring every visitor. This is my taco happy place. But y'all need to get your stuff together on the cash register and bar side. Make the overall experience as good as the food.",1
trn_1602,"Mark and I have wanted to live close to a wine bar for some time, and now we do. Super close...so we really want this place to be successful! The ambiance was relaxing and cool, our waitress was very friendly and helpful and the bottle of zin we ordered was reasonably priced and jammy. Although we only ordered olives, it appears people feel the chef needs to fine tune the food options a bit. Of course we wouldn't mind one or two vegan options added as well. Unwined is very close to excellence. We will continue to support them as they hone their craft!",1
trn_1603,"If Sunday brunch was a religion, I would highly consider converting into it. Conversion to Sunday brunch would require you to accept the fact that you don't need to wake up early on Sunday, and therefore you can allow yourself to eat something that is heavier than just breakfast. Brunch brings to the table a few things that are worthy of worship such as eggs benedict, bagel & lox, and huevos rancheros. I love the concept as we usually have brunch with our friends, family, or loved ones; hence, brunch builds a sense of community. Jokes apart, going for brunch is one of the highest trends in the Toronto restaurant industry. In the past few months a few fine dining restaurants have added a brunch menu. I have a few favourites in the city but today I will focus on The Saint Tavern.

The Saint Tavern is located on Ossington St. near Queen St. West. We were a group of four and we arrived at the restaurant around 1:30PM. It was busy but we were lucky enough to get a very comfy table. The decor was modern and charming. Polished cement floors, old looking light fixtures, all black, white, and gray with a very-large-bar.

We started with the deviled eggs with chives, radish salad, and bacon. It was delicious and we were all fighting to get the last piece. I opted for having their grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomatoes and salad. It was simple but perfect. The strong cheese was balanced by the tomatoes- so yummy! My friends loved their choices and we were all pleased with our waitress. I recall drinking copious amounts of coffee on that day and not eating ANYTHING ELSE after having that meal. 

We spent a few hours at the restaurant and we had a great time! I would love to come back there for another brunch or maybe dinner one day. It feels good to be able to write a review like this one!",1

Then when she was done she turned on a tiny fan and told me to wait for dry. After 10 mins she turned it off and said ok all done! I was charged more than what I was told over the phone, the excuse was we have new management. Smh anyway, usually I am showed to sit and have my hands under a light to dry. So I went home as soon as I got home I looked at my nails and the color was smudged down the nail. I went back and the manager wouldn't give me a refund unless I demanded it.

trn_1609,"I feel like Los Olivos has the potential to be a really great restaurant, but because it's located in the touristy old town Scottsdale the authenticity of the food is lost somewhat. Don't get me wrong though. It's not bad, but I've had better Mexican food up here in Northern Cali. 

If I had to grade the food, I'd give it a C+. Just about average. In my opinion, the food was missing some salt and a little spice. Because this restaurant gets a lot of tourists, I think they toned down the flavors. I guess they figure it's better to be under spiced than over. They've got a great variety of chicken, seafood, and beef dishes. Combination plates make it easy to try a couple different menu items. I had a combo plate with two chicken enchiladas. It was okay.  The rice was decent. It had a predominate onion flavor to it, which I found a little off putting after awhile. Their chips were great. Thin, crispy, and sprinkled with just enough salt. 

For a weekday night, it was jam packed. It was pretty loud and difficult to have a conversation. Service didn't suffer because of the crowd. My table was attended to promptly and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. Everything was on the pricey side. Not outrageous, but I was still a little surprised when we got the bill.

If a lived in the area I might (a very weak might) try Los Olivos again.",0
trn_1610,"If you are from anywhere north of Maryland, you no doubt miss pizza. As an Italian kid from Philly, I end up cooking all my own food, because I'll be dam ned if I'm eating some Olive Garden nonsense.

The we discovered Capriccios. 

Since I was in college, we'd drive over to the south Harrisburg area when we had a few extra bucks to spend to get the real deal slice. Now, I live closer by and have the privilege to eat here whenever I want, and nothing could make me happier.

The food is amazing, the gnocchi, the meats, everything. Thank you Capriccios, you make it taste like home!",1
trn_1611,"Stumbled upon here from Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Thanks, my fellow Yelpers! There were a lot of pictures and tips to get the BLFT and/or stuffed grilled cheese, but I'm a man who needs his meat! 

Instead, I went with the grilled chicken breast sammich, called the House Boat.The House boat had this extremely flaky fluffy bread, too flaky for me, but then again, I'm more of a unleavened bread type of person. The House Boat was served with jalapeno relish, tomato, greens and gorgonzola. I got the habenero basil aioli on the side, along with their house fries, which resembled more like potato chips -- not crunchy, or soggy. It's weird -- when it comes to chips, I like em generally crunchy, kettle-styled. Regardless, the sandwich was very tasty.

They have a small outdoor dining area, three small tables, and are dog-friendly. Food came out fast, service was really good and informative, and overall, a pretty nice lunch dining experience.

trn_1612,"Yeah, meh. MEH! The steaks are par for this course! Outback, Black Angus quality. Sides are ok as well. The rolls however shine! Shine on you crazy rolls, shine on!!! They are sooooo good. You can watch them make them while you wait for your table! And wait you will!!! Even if you call ahead you will wait!!! The other plus is you can throw your peanut shells on the floor. . . just like a regular saw-dust on the floor whore house! The reason this place gets the 2 stars and not 3 or the elusive 3.5 is the salad! Twice, that's right I said it, TWICE now I've gotten a salad with bad lettuce. Gross lettuce. Lettuce past the prime of it's life! Not knowing or caring that the best days are behind him now. Just clinging to the chance to be someone's salad. 
What I'm trying to say is that the lettuce on my salad was bad. Both times the server said ""We've been getting bad lettuce lately."" It must happen often because they have a whole little spiel about it. 2nd time I asked for the manager and some 'ol boy named Garrett (He looked like a Garrett too!) saddled up and gave me the Manager's Special of the same story I just heard!!!!
People. . . How hard is it to find good lettuce?!?!?",-1
trn_1613,"Had my first experience at this wonderful place last night with 3 of my friends. I was amazed at how much fun this was. The staff there is SO much fun. The place was clean and there is a bar obviously. So be sure to tip them ;) 
The whole process is stepped out so do not feel overwhelmed at all. The artist actually paints right along with you to show you what you're to do. There was a quiz last night for ours as well. That was fun and I got a pen for answering correctly (it was a paintbrush pen). 
There are a few breaks so you can let ur painting dry to go to the next step. Which is good for restroom breaks, smoke breaks or refill of your drink break. If you look along the wall in the hallway there are paintings that you can buy. I was told they were $5, but they ended up being $15 each. I had a few more I was going to purchase but ended up not getting them. All the proceeds get donated to different places so that's a PLUS and really shows you how the place is ran! Definitely A+ in my book. Oh one of my friends is a lefty so be sure to note when you're making your reservation for the event that you're left handed so you can sit at an end! And probably best to sit across from your friends if you're taking a group that way you can talk to everyone. There were 4 of us and we sat in the same row. So it was hard to communicate. Which that is an easy fix! Just note that in your reservation as well. Can't wait to go again!",1
trn_1614,"My husband and I were staying at the Springhill Suites and the Peppermill was conveniently located near our hotel. 

Primarily, the interior is beautiful. It's very retro and definitely old Vegas. The interior is beautifully designed with vibrant colors and their fireplace is also beautiful. My husband and I dined on a Saturday evening and the place was empty.
Waiters and cocktail waiters were dressed very unique. The menu is simple, with breakfast offered all day. I had their buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had their fish and chips. Their plates are large! My husbands fish were large fish pieces rather than fish strips. With a lot of curly fries as a side! 

You are also given a complimentary photo and are able to purchase larger photos for 20-25$.
Overall, great experience, glad we visited here for dinner before our visit ended in Vegas. Located a little off the strip, definitely worth the visit to see the Peppermill and it's vibrant, retro, unique colors and styles.",1

trn_1630,"We arrived approximately 15 minutes early for our 8:00 PM dinner reservation at Bradley Ogden. We had a small, private dining room reserved for our group of 11 and we ordered straight from the menu. 

I started with a glass of Perrier Jouet champagne while we waited for the remainder of our group in the lounge. The lounge was very comfortable with large, over sized chairs - almost like a living room. 

I started with the foie gras. 1.5 oz of sonoma foie gras seared with sea salt sprinkled on top.  It was served with a peanut butter mousse and pomegranate gastique on top of a peanut brioch toast stuffed with pear jam. It was delicious and very unusual. 

For my entree, I had the scallops with golden raisin with baby cauliflower confetti curry, flat top seared with sea salt and black pepper. The serving was a great portion, not too large but I was left very satiated. 

We had Quintessa Cabernet and the Grgich hills chardonnay with dinner. Finally, we finished the night with a glass of Patron aged in cognac barrels. 

My only reason for not giving 5 stars is because of an inappropriate comment the server made.",1
trn_1631,"(Review from Sept 2013 visit)
We went with MK to cater a pre-wedding Dinner event on a recommendation, and we were thoroughly pleased.

One should be aware of what this food outlet is so that one's expectations are realistic. They have the capacity to do two things very well - take out food and catering orders.While they have a couple of small tables where one may consume freshly made food this is not a sit down restaurant in the typical sense.
.
What is also useful to know is while the cuisine is Indian it has an East African influence and therefore there are some important differences to the usual Norther Indian restaurant food.So for example the samosas have a thinner crispy, triangular wrapping rather than the doughy, thick wrapping associated with Northern India.They also have fried Muhogo (cassava) that you do not find in Typical Indian cuisine. They make Biryani in two styles, the East African way with the rice and the masala gravy separate or the Lahori style where it is cooked and presented in one vessel.

We had the opportunity to sample various dishes during our two vists there to work out a catering menu for our event. The challenge was to accommodate the significant number of vegetarians among the majority carnivores. The management was very helpful in helping us come up with a good combination of items. My biggest problem was in trying to pick a few dishes as so many delightful items are available.

I would highly recommend the Black Kebabs- fried meatballs essentially, with the right combination of spices. Bet you cannot just eat and stop at one.
For vegetarians they have the spicy potato balls (BatetaVada).
We had Chicken Pakoras that were a huge hit with our guests. The Chicken Biryani is a must.

Next visit I want to try their masala fish- it looked so appetizing, but I truly was way too stuffed to try one more thing.

Our order for 100 people was ready to be picked up at the appointed time.The portions were overly generous.The owners had gone out of their way to obtain disposable serving thalis for us, knowing we were out of town and the party was in a rented community center hall.
I was impressed by the quality and quantity of food and the professionalism of the staff.",1
trn_1632,"Everything was great but how does a brand new place run out of food when it just recently opened and it is trying to get loyal customers. Half of the things they promote is their food and for them to not be serving it, and without any sign of notice until I got to the register is extremely disappointing. 

The staff seemed extremely all over the place and the person yelling out order numbers was being overly aggressive when calling them out.",-1
trn_1633,"I love this place! It offers friendly solace in a busy city, as well as expertly crafted coffee beverages. When Dale is preparing food, you do not want to say no. Delicious, and crafted with attention to detail and taste. Sandrine and Zion are delightful hosts who make me feel like I am truly having coffee with a friend.",1
trn_1634,"I booked a room for five days at this location. The desk staff was very helpful and friendly and check in and out was a breeze. The hotel itself offers free water, coffee or tea, with a selection of fruit. I did not get to check out the hotel amenities (hot tub, pool, fitness center), but they did have a laundry room onsite. It would be great if they supplied free laundry soap and dryer sheets as a courtesy since they are charging you for using the machines. As for the room, it was decent and a Kurig machine is provided with a mini fridge and microwave, but the sugar at the coffee station seemed old and stuck together. The house cleaning staff  did not supply much splenda in the rooms and I ran out after the first night. They also did a mediocre job with cleaning the rooms and left used glassware. Overall, my experience was not bad. The kitchen menu offers smoothies, which I thought was great! However, I did order fried eggs with potatoes on one occasion and the meal came out with bacon and toast. Being a vegetarian I asked for a new dish without bacon, and I could tell they only took the bacon off the plate. The meal tasted and smelled like bacon grease. Pretty lousy. I guess they don't realize vegetarians can taste food tainted by meat! The sad part, I already gave them a tip when I ordered the meal. Watch out if you have any food allergies!",0
trn_1635,"Excellent service. Chilequiles were average, not spicy, just lacked flavor. Rice is very bland, I added their spicy (not at all spicy) salsa. Refried beans excellent! Chips are hard and dry. Overall, this meal was quite disappointing. Cashier is nice but slow as molasses. I'll be back again a time or two trying different things.",0
trn_1636,"I now know the decent overall rating this place received on yelp is due to it's affordability and not much anything else.  The wife and I checked out this place yesterday.  We ordered:  beef tendon, deep fried squid legs, shrimp chow fun, hotpot lapchong rice, preserved egg and pork congee and the lobster & chow mein special.  The total bill came out to $30 approx. (including taxes).  

If you know anything about dim sum, or chinese food, you would agree, this overall total is very very cheap for what we ordered.  

However, food to me, isn't about being just cheap.  If you are going to part ways with your hard earned dollar, make sure you get 'value' in return.  When it comes to food, the term 'value' includes the yummy-factor and not only the cost. 

The wife and I generally go for dim sum at Royal Tea House, Dragon Boat or Spring Villa.  Three of the top dim sum joints in Richmond Hill and Markham for the price.  Compared to the quality and amount of food we get at these three dim sum joints, Fisherman Villa is a grave disappointment.

Summary:
1.  Come here if - you are a starving student on a fixed income; or, if you know how to speak Cantonese and don't mind the rough service you get from some of the staff (a certain woman in particular).
2.  Don't come here if - you value taste, quality and portion size as being more important than saving $2-$3 per dish;  or, you want a clean, modern ambiance to eat and relax in

Final Words:
This place is a poor representation of dim sum in terms of quantity and quality of dishes served.  Of course it's cheap, they give you nothing.  The egg in the congee was diced so small it was probably 1/10 of the entire egg.  The XXL squid legs were so soggy and oily and without flavour - not to mention tiny in portion size;  I had to force myself to finish it on account of the fact there are starving children in North Korea....

FOODIES - do not come here.  Spend the extra $2-$3 more and go to Royal Tea House in Markham or Spring Villa on Woodbine/Steeles.  You won't regret it.",-1
trn_1637,"This one was a tough one to decide upon a rating. Some dishes came out full of flavour but mine was a complete miss.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and rounded up my 1.5.
The good news was the Blackened Chicken Bowties.  A very flavourful dish and the pasta was nicely done to al dente.  Also a generous portion.
The bad news was the 'attempt' at their Herbed Brie Double Chicken. It was advertised as a double chicken breast however I got the leg and thigh of what looked like a cornish game hen.  The 'brie' portion was minimal and was over-whelmed with the red pepper sauce.  It looked great on the menu but what was delivered fell well short.
Service was okay throughout the night so that was a positive.",-1
trn_1638,"Not even 'okay' food. I would not eat here again.

My sliders consisted of: hard bread, thin burger meat, a pickle in the burger and a pickle on top of the burger. So strange. McDonalds would have tasted better.
I also ordered the Cesar. It tasted bitter with too much added kale, and they didn't even mix the dressing into the salad. 
We  had to wait 30 minutes+ for our food on a day they weren't busy.

trn_1644,"Been going here for years because my wife seems to like ketchup topped matzo with way too much cheese.  They have always had bad service, but this last (and final time) was the worst.  The kid, who seems to charge something different every time, even though we always order the same thing takes my order.  He repeats the wrong order back to me, and I correct him.  When I get back home low and behold we have the wrong pie.  Well I call up expecting them to make a new pizza or at least make the half they got wrong in a smaller size.  I get crickets.  The kid says I should have told him when he repeated the order back to me.  I explained that is what happened and he thinks I am lying to him.  Trying to remind him that I order there all the time does nothing for this kid.  My wife has to be the only regular this place has I have never seen anyone in there besides this kid and the owner.  I ask him to contact the owner and see what he thinks they should do.

After a while on hold it turns out I am out of luck on this pie, and I will have to get ""a deal"" on my next one.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  My wife won't eat this thing you made it wrong.  And like I said its for her because I hate this place. 

In the end I am going to have to cancel the credit card purchase and battle it out there.  This place is a joke and can't even make a good pie!",-1

Great opportunity for both north and South Indian dishes to be enjoyed, ask the servers to guide you thru the South Indian dishes as they're a tad bit more spicy!

Hint: if you see a decent Indian crowd in their restaurants chances are it's pretty darn good food!",1

trn_1647,"Red Gate serves Korean style Chinese food in the Greenland foodcourt. 

The best deal is their combos of a noodle dish (either black bean noodle, seafood noodle soup or a 50/50 bowl of both), plus meat dish (sweet and sour pork or spicy fried chicken) as that is $11-14 and can easily feed two people. Otherwise, I think for Chinese food the prices seem high-ish but I haven't eaten much of the menu. 

So I got the black bean noodle (jjangmyeun) + fried crispy chicken combo. The noodle was decent aside from needing a tiny bit more seasoning of salt. The fried crispy chicken isn't what I was expecting, but battered and fried nuggets in a sweet and sour type sauce with onions and peppers. They give you a side of kimchee, yellow pickles, black bean paste with sweet raw onions. The portion, again, can feed two easily or one very hungry mofo. 

I think for their combos, it's not a bad spot to go to, but I don't know if I want to delve into the rest of the menu. I guess it's different since its Chinese cooked in a Korean style and is a niche I don't see anywhere else.",0
trn_1648,"Very interesting flavors! I got the Cap'n Crunch (tried fruity pebbles and birthday cake), my friend got chocolate chip-mostly chocolate, and my bf got sweet and salty brownie. They come in little Chinese food take out boxes which I don't really like because I feel like it's gonna leak out when it Melts. The parking is atrocious but I found a decent spot after circling the block once. And the building is a renovated house that fits maybe 6 thin customers at once. Lots of outside seating though.
I will say this place is insanely popular though for adult and kids.",1

There is 40% tax apparently and they charged an extra day since we were 3 hours late on return, despite us telling them we'd returning the car in the late afternoon. Apparently 12 pm is the same as late afternoon. They basically screw you since you have no time to argue when you're trying to catch a plane. Will never use this company again. STAY AWAY!!",-1
trn_1650,"Our instructor Heather a.k.a. Roxy if ya nasty was a lot of fun and walked us through a lap dance and pole dancing and a whole lot of booty shaking! The class wasn't too full so even though there were other groups we all had some pole time. 

The lap dancing portion was the best part and Heather spilt all the secrets. This woman made me ready to lay it down next time I see my boo!

Booking process was really easy, we called in advance to make a reservation however was not told of the fee to change class times if needed. When we got to the box office late for our class after already going back and forth with them on the phone about the hidden fee, there was a hug eline in front of the theater because the will call line for the shows in the V theater is the same lone you get your tickets for the 101 class, so be prepared to wait. After the line and battle with management we took some pics, filled out paperwork (just a short waiver) and got into class. The room was in the Theatre but off to the side, I can't really describe it because its simply a room not really its own studio or building you know. But it was spacious had poles, dim lighting and a mini stage. 

Overall, we had a blast, Heather was very nice and good instructor. Plus her music selection was on point. After her class, I know she has the fellas making it rain!!! - Other than the hiccup with management, the rude attitude and lack of consideration from Adam and Ashton on the phone it was a good class.

trn_1652,"My Fiance surprised me with a new puppy, which means a doggy doctor is needed. I have been to Pecan Grove previously to see Dr. Holmes for my rabbit  domino.  The visit was quick, affordable, and he gave me a bunch of suggestions as preventative measures for common rabbit ailments. 

I saw Dr. Edwards yesterday with my new puppy Bernie.  She was very friendly, informative and kinda hot. Bernie liked her and that is what matters.  I love that she took the time to actually pet him and get her face licked....he's a real vicious one. I got his second vaccination, and she informed me of the parvo epidemic that spread across the valley. After being thoroughly scared, I thought I should do a stool sample since he was around other dogs a week ago, but instead of running the test and charging me, she said it was not necessary as he has shown no symptoms and is in great condition. 

I was given a puppy packet, a free month of pet insurance, a month supply of heart work preventative and again, even though I was ready to buy the 6 month supply, she told me to wait since Bernie is growing so fast. I really love that they are not trying to sell me everything under the sun.

trn_1653,"Visited this establishment on 1/5/18 due to running across ""unlimited sushi and sliders"" on Groupon. This caught my attention as I have a massive appetite. The gist, for $20 a person, or $20 for a date with the Groupon, you get to choose from a very tasty and fresh assortment of everyday as well as special rolls very well prepared as well as deliciously deceiving sliders. You can also choose other items like potstickers, crab salad, and bang bang shrimp. The atmosphere is relaxed, food is fresh, price is fair, & overall this is a great place for yourself, a date night, or family outing. Definitely a recommendation. Just make sure you eat all the buns for the sliders or ask they serve the sliders without buns as the establishment does not want food wasted & will make you pay for it, which is only fair considering food costs money.

trn_1654,"Lula Lounge Cuban Brunch is held on Sundays and was picked as a venue for a friend's birthday party. What a great idea! For $15 you get an excellent AYCE brunch along with salsa dancing lessons. First you can eat from a centrally located buffet that had a traditional breakfast selection along with healthful choices so you could pick and choose some of each. All of it was top notch and fresh. Desserts were good too and we indulged in Mimosas to go along with the party theme.
The best part was the dance lesson and the music along with the charismatic dance instructor who was fabulously engaging, animated and hilarious. His moves were great!
Of course he made it look easy but there was no problem dancing goofy as everyone was staring at the instructor.
The music was excellent, although you had to zone out the drum machine to enjoy the singing, guitar and flute playing. Oh ya! The guy on flute was great and that instrument was perfect for the music.

trn_1656,"Have to chime in for my favorite restaurant on the planet.

Now granted, my reviews here are skewed on the budget front -- every time I've eaten at this joint, which is four times now, it has been on the company dime.

But let me tell you in no uncertain terms, if money is less of an object for a night, and you want an amazing meal, this place is at the top of your list. Just ask the waiter to work with the chef and keep things at $X/person, and sit back let them wow you. I wouldn't go choosing your meal, let the Asian gods of fate smile upon you. (Errr, somethin.) I won't go into the menu as others have, and besides, I've tried almost everything and there isn't a dish in the place that isn't at least an A-.

You have to be a fucking punk to give this place 2 or 3 stars. It's straight up amazing.",1
trn_1657,"I just went in here to fix my son's ipod touch 4g and it was both the glass and the digitizer that needed repair. It cost me 85.00 + tax and my son had tp pay most of it.

1.  Service - Friendly staff and quick to serve you. Young and pretty cool.

2.  Quality - So far, I would say, I cannot tell any difference. It seems just like new!  The screen was left with all the technician's smudge marks on it, however, that is neutral for me and not an issue. These guys are good and busy, so wiping a screen is not the concern.  Although when you pay for Apple to fix this stuff, they usually will clean the screen and package the repair nicely. (Of course it costs more too.)

3.  Price - I read the other reviews where people who paid 40.00 to repair cracked glass.  So, either I was ripped off, or the others that reviewed did not have an ipod touch 4g.  In any case, I believe I got a great price as at the Apple on line, the repair is gonna cost 149.00, if it is not ""abused"".  And, they may give you a replacement, meaning all your data is gone..... So, for me, it was a great price and my 12 year old son was very happy.

4.  Be sure to mention yelp. I did not notice this comment before I went there, it would have been worth 5.00 off.

5.  GK Says- This place is a quality place.",1
trn_1658,"This location is very busy and they do a great job of managing the line. There is not a lot of seating when it gets busy, so prepare to do some standing during the busy periods.

I had the Mangonada, and although the mangos were fresh, the flavor combination was a huge turn off for me. What redeemed this place was the coffee horchata! I highly recommend it. It may not look like the best drink on the menu but this is by far my favorite.

It's really annoying to have to wait for the machine to be repaired because it seems to take quite some time.  They also turn the AC and fans up way too high during the summer.  I get that no one wants it to be stuffy, but we should still be able to work up some sort of sweat.

Aside from those things, I love this place!  I hate to workout, so it's a requirement that the environment be pleasant and contemporary looking.  They have a decent amount of treadmills and other cardio machines.  If you like to take classes, this is a great gym for you.  Spin class is my favorite!",1

Had the beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken recently.  All of which were made from picky-eater friendly ingredients, and were a hit with the kids.  I do like the fact that the staff is all Chinese and a few words spoken from the customers in Mandarin seem to go over well.

This did not disappoint me. It was great. We had a party of four, all of us ordered off the Restaurant weeks menu. Two of the party had the Charleston Crab soup, it was delicate but full of crab and delicious, and a very large bowl. One of my party had the Wedge salad which I have had before and they are known for--it was fantastic! I ordered the Filet of Beef with Blue Cheese fondue---Melted in my mouth!! Could have ordered two plates of it!! For my Entree i  had the Cold Water Lobster tail, they were two smaller ones cut in half but wonderfully fresh and tasty. My husband had the Rack of Ribs, smokey and falling off the bone! My friends had the Lamb Chops which looked incredible and the other woman had The Crab Cakes, she loves to order them all over and said these were some of the best!  Desserts were very special, I had the Italian Almond Creme cake..like a Tiramisu with Amaretto instead of coffee and brandy ..It was like a cloud! My husband had the Creme Brulee which was very good. 
We left feeling very satisfied to find out that it was still a great choice and a place to remember to come ...----more often!!",1

I had brought food pre packaged from Flower child due to the fact that I have dietary restrictions that make it difficult for me to eat anywhere. Rather than eat inside and be disrespectful to the establishment I sat outside. I  was told that I can't eat my food there sure to health regulations OUTSIDE!  Not to mention there are dogs sitting outside!! whah!!  (i love dogs and really don't care) but just seems unfair to accommodate for patrons  so sad. :(,-1

trn_1670,"Tried Scrambles after reading good reviews.  Unfortunately, food was cold, bacon was under cooked, biscuits and gravy was just 'slop' and it too was cold. Eggs were OK but it is hard to mess up eggs. Drip coffee had a very off taste like the carafe had not been cleaned in weeks. 
Overall the place was clean but it seemed as if they were not ready to be open this morning. 
Another thing to note that is not very clear is that it is a walk up service restaurant.   You order, then find a table and then they bring out your cold food.",-1

I'd wake up from a coma to eat that Shrimp Burger!!! Simply delicious and friendly place to hang out with friends.",1
trn_1672,"After reading the reviews we decided to try out this place last week. While the presentation of the restaurant is great when you walk in, it's def nicely decorated and kitschy since it's adjacent to a gas station, I'm not sure what everyone is raving about as far as the food.

Unsure of the portions we decided to split the cheeseburger and brisket sandwich. There wasn't really anything special about it as we found the brisket tough to chew and the cheeseburger just ordinary and nothing to write home about. If you order the brisket even sliced I felt I had to saw the brisket into small easy pieces to swallow and this is a task as you only have plastic utensils to do it and in a small basket. While there was a little BBQ sauce bar by the drink section, I believe that good BBQ and brisket doesn't need to be smothered in sauce to taste good. The only thing we didn't try and maybe it could of upgraded our experience was something from the dessert case. Nice and clean establishment but I've had much better.",-1

Their lotus flower is great too.",1

There was a wait, but Elegant is honestly the nicest/ cleanest nail salon in town and the staff is very nice, so it was worth it. 

The most impressive thing they did today was remember me from my last visit and genuinely apologize. They are back in my good graces. I have referred nearly all my girlfriends here and for the most part they love it too!! Mimi, Christine and Kevin are our faves but everyone is nice!",1
trn_1676,"Was recommended to try this place by few people and today was my first time here. All I can say is, I am coming back very soon.

SERVICE
Wasn't sure if the guy was the owner but he was friendly and talked story while we waited for our food. Loved it!! Food came out within 10 min. 

FOOD
Tried hamburger steak and it was so delicious. Gravy/sauce they put on the hamburger steak was perfect! Also came with onion rings on top which I love. Chicken katsu was amazing! Chicken katsu here is crunchy and surprisingly has a flavor by itself that you really don't need a sauce for it. Best chicken katsu I had. 

OVERALL
It was a journey to get to this place as it took about 30min from my house but the service and food here made it worth the drive. I also love how they had a poster of Keali'i Reichel.

trn_1678,"Sun & Ski is pretty much as the name suggests. It's primarily dedicated to cold weather sports. Sort of a niche market presence. I imagine they do most business in the winter however, with Lake Norman not far away there is a big market in the area for water sports too. Their biggest sections would be bikes (all types including on and off road) including a maintenance shop, snowboarding and skiing, extensive shoe selection and lots of seasonally appropriate apparel. Generally this place will satisfy your outdoor extreme sports itch if it is a specific one for the above sports. But I definitely wouldn't recommend them as a choice location for hikers, climbers and campers. If you can manage to get to REI it would be better for you. And if you're the more rugged outdoorsy type, the Bass Pro Shop at the other end of the mall is preferable.",0

Ordered a couple of smoothies for my daughter and crepes.  Smoothies were supposed to be right up.  Never showed.  The crepes came after a loooong wait at which point we asked for the smoothies.  They made it up once my daughters finished their crepes.  I ordered a montreal smoked meat sandwich - it was HORRIBLE.  The meat was mush and super salty on a tiny sandwich with also very salty mustard.  I was supposed to have a glass of water, I gave up waiting and went and got my own.  I guess that bent the servers nose out of joint as my daughter said she rolled her eyes at me when we left.  We won't be back.",-1
trn_1681,"Where is this place? Its in an office complex that can be totally missed if you weren't looking for it. The decor inside and on the patio is pretty fantabuloso. We went here for my wife's bday and it was a blast. We scored the cool patio tent which made for an excellent evening outside with the Vegas heat cooling down (yet after a few glasses of wine you get heated up again) Word on the patio tent is first come first serve, or if you need it guaranteed for your dinner plans, plan to drop $1000 min to secure it. Otherwise anywhere else in the restaurant is still a nice experience. We were here on a sat night and to our surprise we got to enjoy a really cool band set up next to our tent. It was a very nice chillaxin vibe with good food and good company. 
The food was excellent and expect to pay 25 - 30+ for entrees. The only problem I had was with the initial reservation. I had called and made the reservation on a Tuesday, for a Saturday evening dinner. Luckily I called a few hours ahead to confirm reservations because they had no record of it!!!!! If I remember correctly, the initial girl I spoke with seemed really distracted taking my reservation and answering my questions, almost sounded annoyed. I was really disappointed with this. But luckily the nice girl who I spoke with the day of our reservation assured me she could fit us in and even made sure we scored the tent when we arrived. Much thanks for that. I forgot your name but you were the pretty, sexy, black girl with short hair at the front! The whole staff that night was pretty busy but still accommodating.

The menu is farm to table, ridiculously fun mixtures of ingredients. I had the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado) on fresh brioche with a side of corn salad. It was fantastic! Full of light and fresh flavors. My business partner had the veggie burger with a side of the cucumber salad.... same reaction!

Great vibe and friendly staff!

trn_1683,"I went in yesterday looking for some luggage...
What used to be pretty recognizable brands such as Samosonite, wasn't really anywhere to be found.  While this location boasts an expansive ""home / housewares"" section, make-up & fragrance, it's just really a lot of merchandise packed in any space they can put it.  
Upon looking at the luggage, which was totally a mess, I didn't see anything that caught my eye.  Not to mention, it was a ""ghost town."" I didn't see any other customers or associates...& this was around 12 PM. Needless to say, I walked out of the department (& the store) empty-handed.

The good thing about  Belk is they ALWAYS have sales & ALWAYS have clearance areas.  Back in the day, you wouldn't catch me shopping for clothes, shoes or accessories anywhere but at Belk. Clearly, my tastes & budget has changed, so unfortunately, I don't shop at a Belk hardly ever these days.",0

trn_1691,"First off, we got 5 star service at this place.  This could've had something to do with our earlier arrival time (we sat down for brunch at around 10:30 am) and the amount of staff they had on hand, but our main server was great.  He was very attentive and inquisitive, and seemed very committed to delivering a quality experience.  The bussers also appeared in a snap to pick up discarded napkin rings as soon as they hit the table and clear plates as soon as the last bite had been consumed.

The atmosphere is also great.  Kind of a early 20th century southern feel, and they project old photos of musicians on the wall to keep your eyes occupied.  

The food is tasty, although very heavy.  I started off with a bourbon blackberry lemonade.  We also got the deviled eggs, kale salad, mac and cheese, and the savory cheddar waffle.  It was all very tasty, though the flavors were so heavy and rich I felt pretty sluggish for the remainder of the afternoon.  Definitely a strong bourbon theme running through their food, so if you hate bourbon be wary.  

They also have a very extensive drinks list.  In addition to the very interesting mixed drink options, they have a solid wine list and an excellent 2 page beer list.  They feature many local beers on draft, which is tough to find on the strip.  We ended up trying a flight of their local Nevada pours.

So with 5 star service, 5 star atmosphere, 5 star drink list and 4 star food (yummy but just a tad heavy for me), I'd give this an overall 5 star experience.",1
trn_1692,"So first let me start by saying that I am not the type to go out of my way to leave a bad review for anyone. I am a loyal client to many and appreciate great customer service as I myself have worked in customer service field. I have been to this location before and had no complaints. Today I decided to come here and invite my family along only to waste almost half of my day. We showed up and noticed the placed was pretty busy, we were told it would only be 30 minutes. We waited and then noticed they took everyone else but us so we started to worry. We asked how much longer it would be and the guy at the front said it would be about 15 more minutes so we decided to wait. At some point every one but us had sat down, they finally take my sister and my mom while I'm still sitting there. At that point a girl is also sitting there and ask how much longer and she is also told 15 minutes but she came after us so I'm wondering how that will be possible. The guy becomes available then tells the girl to sit there for her gel manicure the same service I needed. Then to make matters worse I heard the technician next to him talk about clients who don't understand that people have appointments among other things, mean while the person they are complaining about (me) the client is sitting there. I guess they felt it was ok to complaint about customers amongst themselves. Long story short they finally take me mean while the girl who came after me is almost done with her service. At this point I'm quiet but had enough when I realized they forgot my little sister and kept once again sitting everyone else coming in. I finally say something only for the guy to say he was too busy to know. Not sure why he was working the front desk if he is too busy and at the very least he should've said he was he was unsure about the wait time or explain what was going on. If you're new they will treat you like nothing and will not communicate, absolutely the worse place I have been to in a long time. Will not be going back and will share my experience with my friends and family.",-1

I agree with other reviewers. It is definitely one of the smallest Starbucks I have seen. The best option is to drive-thru. During mornings and evenings, the line starts forming outside the shop and there is hardly any place to sit inside.

trn_1696,"Let's get straight to the point! Walked in, they said it was a 30 min wait no big deal. Fast forward an hour and a half we get a table after my wife went to the hostess and asked where we were on the list, and she replied""i can just sit you here""  got a table and sat there for 20 min before a server came over to us. The server takes our order, and my wife asked for the salad with thousand island dressing and he says ""our thousand island dressing is amazing"" food comes out about 15 min later and my wife tried the salad and stops eating because the dressing is too spicy. She tells the server I don't think this is thousand island it's too spicy and he said oh ya we don't have thousand island so I brought you the closest thing to it.

On top of ok BBQ, the amount of time you wait for your food. Or to even order. No priority here. During the lunch rush you can watch cooks play and laugh back there instead of putting their heads down and rocking out tickets. 4 dollars for frozen potatoes by the way. Not even house made. Cheap Sysco ketchup to go along with it and super runny almost water ranch. I only mention it because of the prices.

This Wendy's has also been converted into a place that resembles a rich bachelor's pad complete with a TV, fireplace, and couches. Fancy new digs ya have, Wendy.

Working with many sign companies in the past has been very trying and difficult.  Until we found signs now.  Tina has been on top of it and so helpful in our design process.  Our tenants are picky and want to change things constantly.  I have had to meet with Tina multiple times and she is always there to help and has never complained once about the constant changes we have had to make.  We will continue to use Signs now for all of our centers.  Tina loves her job and she is great at it.",1

trn_1710,So let me tell ya'll!! This is probably one of the best places I have ever been to. I loved every thing about my full set. Cindy did an amazing job at my ombré and I was just in awe. Definitely my new nail place to go to!,1
trn_1711,"The meat jun is a solid four stars. The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.  

Service can be better, but the lady has all tables to herself.  I guess someone called in sick today?  It's a fairly cheap meal for Korean food.  

Long story short, come for the meat jun and that's it.",0

Side- Yukon Mashed Potatos better then grandmas

Dessert- Bananas Foster Bread pudding 

Very nice spot",1

Portion is pretty good.  Broth tasty but a bit on the salty side.

Noodles are fresh and have a nice texture.

Also enjoy the salmon onigiri as a side dish.

Service is always decent and the food is delivered to your table fast.

Probably on the pricey side but I think it's to be expected with the ramen craze that is going on.

I still need to try a few more ramen places to really know where this ranks in the ramen crowd.",1
trn_1714,"This place serves inventive and savory food inspired by, I believe, Polish cuisine. They have pierogies, lots of dishes with cabbage. That's a vegan restaurant in rustic style, but unlike some vegan restaurants this one doesn't serve processed replacements of cheese and such. Instead they create their own recipes and achieve great combinations. Definitely, a unique place.",1

trn_1716,"We were in the neighbourhood and arrived to the bakery early afternoon on a Sunday. There was a constant flow of people while we were staring at all the beauties behind the glass counter. Definitely, pre-order if you have a specific item in mind for an event. They offer whole cakes also; 5-inch diameter cake serves six people and eight-inch diameter serves twelve people.

The first thing that caught my eye was the Waterberry (Summer Special) - watermelon strawberry rosewater infused cake - was so lovely. The cake is unique, definitely refreshing, and aesthetically pleasing. A nice and structured cake, which was dense and light at the same time. 
I really enjoy all the layers in the cake - definitely prefer these multi layered cakes the most. All the various complementary flavours and different textures. I mean look at these delicious layers! Colour are vibrant contrast of the pale cream to the sweet watermelon and the pistachio to the strawberries. The cake layers are fragrant and perfumed by the rosewater and pastry cream. There is limited seating by the entrance if you wanted to stick around and have the desserts at the bakery. While we were leaving, we overheard a couple discussing and looking at designs on their upcoming event. such a great idea! :) 

Pick up three macarons as well; earl grey, pistachio, and Vietnamese coffee. The macarons looked tempting and they had interesting flavours! The macaron cookies puffed up nicely and have a generous amount of filling sandwiched between a light and crispy cookie. Both the cake and macarons were good (the cookie part of the macaron was a bit too sweet though) - regardless, I really like the Vietnamese coffee out of all three flavours.

I would come back to try their other cakes - it looked good! Good thing they keep their website updated and post pictures of how the cake looks sliced and the overall outside appearance. Appreciate that!",1

Inquiring for their hours of operations  and curious about what type of Laos hot food they had ready made.  Couple hours later as I entered the store I was greeted ""hello, welcome"". by a gentleman at the register. The store is small had good selections of frozen meats/ fish/exotic bugs. Some of their vegetables are fresh and others are wilted. Ready made dipping sauces $6 a container. The two sweet lady working behind the hot deli section, what a gem, they are informative with my many questions. She recommend Laos beef/ beef balls/rice noodle soup, it was hot flavorful, salty/sweet /beefy . Dinning table lined with green plastic cover with utensils and varied selections of condiments salt,pepper, 4 different type of chilies pickled, fresh, in oil & dried and the usual soy sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce.  On the menu it had two different type of papaya salad Laos or Thai. Thai papaya I was told are sweet made with fish sauce, salty crab, peanuts. We opted for Laos papaya made with pahdek a fermented fish ( anchovies) with a pungent smell, its sweet, salty, sour with each bite of crunch of the fresh shredded papaya/longbean  goodness . FYI make sure to mention your preferred level of spicy. I ordered to go larb beef, a choice of raw or cooked beef salad. The cooked beef salad were delicious, enhance flavors with variety of herbs , cilantro, lemongrass, basil, mint, rice powder a hint of citrus juice. My dad mention the beef salad was good. 
On my next trip to Las Vegas I will stop in again to try their  ready made desserts  and other selections I  haven't yet tried.",1

If your going to sell a limon at least let your costumers know up front before they drive across town to see your product.

The noodles didn't taste like anything and the pork was salty and cold. They also forgot some of our orders and when they arrived, they were also cold and bland as well. The servers were also rude. They spill your food all over the table and place your dish as far away from you as possible. You'd be better off spending your money elsewhere.",-1

We had a party""party attendant"" who was constantly on break or MIA.I had to go find him for everything. The rest of the staff seemed to be on break as well. There was one attendant running the rides. When I asked to speak to a mgr, I was told that she wasn't there and the night mgr was on their way.
The bathrooms were disgusting and there was no baby changing station that I could find. I saw lady change a poopy diaper on one of the tables where you eat.
The party areas floor and tables were dirty and sticky. During the eating part, no.one was around and I had to clean up everything.
Do not have a party here if you expect to be able to relax and enjoy it with your family and friends. Very disappointing.

It also comes with ""pots,"" which are their house potatoes and I don't know what it is about them but they are amazing? I truly am still in shock from this place. I want to go everyday. I also got a chocolate chip scone and a salted caramel brownie for later. They serve Press Coffee which is a yummy local favorite.

trn_1738,"I was looking for a tapas restaurant in Calgary and came across Taste. 

The Short: Great food, Great service, Great ambiance.

** Tues is a tasting menu for $30 - A good night to try this place out.

**Also, Thurs are 'sausage fest' night where they have sausages and beer on special.

The Long:

Was very excited and looking forward to my tapas meal and to catch up with an old friend. What a wonderful place for both!!! It's not too big, and has a nice cozy ambiance. When the sunsets, its nicely lit with dim (but not too dim) lighting. There are a few tall 'bar' type tables and regular tables mixed together. The music is not too loud so that you can have comfortable conversations.

For dinner, at first I thought the menu was limited. However, after finishing our meal i changed my mind - it is just right.  They have a section that's $5, $10, $15, and then plates of 3 items of 'fish', 'meat', or 'cheese' that's $20 - and those plates are changed frequently.  It's nice cuz every time you come in, you can mix and match different items and have a whole different (yet complete) meal.  All the food we tried was great!!! (more details below)

They have a nice small but varietal selection of 6 reds and 6 whites (all Rieslings tonight), cocktails, and beers. All are changed quite frequently as we were told by our waitress. Our waitress was super nice as we couldn't decide which white wine we wanted (since we normally dont' drink wine) and she let us taste 2 diff bottles to help us decide! Was sooo helpful in our decision and made our dinner enjoyable as we weren't 'stuck' with a glass of wine that we didn't like.

What we ordered (wish i took pics but forgot):

We decided to choose one item from the $5, $10, and $15 meal, and then finish with 2 desserts, and we were full!

1) duck fat popcorn - which is popcorn that was popped/cooked in duck fat. You might think ewww, but it was REALLY tasty! the popcorn actually picked up the duck flavor!  I guess it's good if you like duck, and not so good if you're not a fan of duck, luckily I am a fan of duck!

2) porcini mushroom gnocchi - they make their own gnocchi in house which is nice (the only way I eat it ;) hahah) and it was drizzled with truffle oil. The taste was yummy. 

3) Pork belly - my favorite pork belly EVER!!!! There was nice flavour and the skin was mod crispy because it was caramelized!!! sooo yummy with the sweetness that comes through, and with the red pepper sauce it was soo nice.  I would definitely come back here just for the pork belly. A must try!!

4) Shared 2 desserts:

a) tiramisu - it's not a traditional tiramisu, it was a tuile cup filled with lady finger on the bottom ( i believe) and the cream and mocha filled the rest of the cup, with a coconut sauce on the plate which kinda tasted like coconut evaporated milk! hahah. Was a good portion and nice and creamy - but not to overly heavy. I actually enjoyed this more than a traditional tiramisu, and the tuile gives a nice crispy part to it.

b) a trio of creme brulee: cinnamon, ginger, and clove - Very nice flavors, I liked the cinnamon and clove, but didn't care too much for the ginger but that's a personal taste as i don't like ginger that much (such a disgrace being that I'm Asian! hahah jk).",1
trn_1739,"If you want to know the strength of a buffet, go during dinner because that's where they pull all their guns out. We got comped so it was a no-brainer what meal to use it on.

I'll say outside of maybe the prime rib and crab legs, it was a really an average spread. Even the dessert bar wasn't anything to get excited about. They had the usual suspects: pizza, mac n cheese, Chinese food, sushi, etc. but I had a hard time figuring out what to get because I don't like to waste my appetite of fillers like carbs. 

At $30 a pop it isn't outrageous, but it could be better. Our server also was just ok so that's adds to the experience too. Considering the ton of restaurants inside the resort, I kind of expect the buffet to step it up. MGM isn't known for their buffet and now I know why.",0
trn_1740,This place is amazing and the service was quick and friendly. We had the Tonkotsu and the pork  broth was incredible.  The seasoned egg was a complete surprise and extremely tasty.

trn_1742,"Hubby and I love this place.  We've had Chinese food all over the country, including Chinatown in San Francisco, and we think the food here is just great.  The sauces are so delicious, the veggies are crisp, they put a ton of shrimp in their dishes, and the meats are good quality (some buffets have really fatty, tough meat).  If you want the buffet, you need to be here between 11:30 and 1:30 when dishes are hot and fresh. They have additional dishes at the dinner buffet, but we think lunch is the best deal.  Hope this place never changes.",1
trn_1743,"Grilled cheese with bacon? Yes. Absolutely yes.

Co-workers raved about Bacon...said they went all the time...so I went with them to try it out. 

Loved the space. Open, comfy, and just a little bit kitch in an Old Town kind of way. 

The menu was okay. Our server was nice. The cooks in the kitchen were creative. Very creative...and I don't mean this as a good thing. 

Apparently, they didn't have enough veggies to grill for my co-worker's veggie wrap, so they um made it up. Put in what they had...which included some interesting choices. And they didn't tell anyone. It was a first-bite surprise.

Our server comped her meal...but a little head's up from the kitchen staff could have let her pick one of the other tasty creations that ended up at our table...like the breakfast burrito or the BLT.",-1
trn_1744,"Confused is the word that describes the service here. Every time we asked a question, the first person we asked had no answer so they got ""the manager"" of which they seem to have a lot. We were ignored for a long time, then when a server came, she seemed surprised to see us. The back room was noisy and they had a TV tuned to the Amazing Race--so annoying. When I asked them to turn it to something that wouldn't kill my brain cells or to turn it off, they put on ESPN news--not a game. The meat and cheese platter was very good. My husband and son had steaks which they said were average. I had the pork and beans which were really good, but overpriced. The peanut butter cup was ""to-die-for!"" Every one of their desserts had nuts in them and my son  is allergic to all tree nuts, so nothing for him. The wines were way overpriced and they had no dessert wines or after-dinner drinks. I wouldn't go back.",-1
trn_1745,"We bought some small spinach pastries to go.  They were pre-wrapped, without date or indications of any kind.  When I got home I removed plastic wrap and the sides had alot of mold.   Terrible.  If a business is going to pre-wrap pastries, they have to put some date on the package, so they can ensure some quality level they are giving customers.  Very simple, glaring error.

We had eaten there earlier in the night, and the eat-in food was ok.  

FWIW, the restaurant on Yonge and Dundas is better.",-1
trn_1746,"I'm a legal professional and I use the dry cleaners a lot. It's always a dilemma finding a good dry cleaners, since the quality varies so much.  I used to go to overpriced mediocre places downtown, but then I decided to one closed to my home, and this place is great.  Not only is it uber cheap but also great quality.  In addition to shirts, I find that they clean other specialty items (suits, fine dresses, and jackets) very well without leaving residue, burning things, or leaving stains.  

I've gone to cheap downtown drycleaners but they ruin anything more expensive than everyday work shirts.  So all in all, this place has a good balance between cheap and good quality cleaning for all items of clothing.",1

They even packed the complimentary chips and dips and soup into the take out, which is considerate. FYI, the salsa they packed us was so large, it lasted my boyfriend and I for three days.

trn_1752,"I was debating between doing this one and Battlefield Vegas. I am definitely glad that I decided to go with the Best Bang for Your Buck Groupon experience for two at Gun Garage. Not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. They provide you with transportation to and from the strip. The driver was nice and very conversational. 

Once we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our IDs, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. Our range safety officer's name was James and he was extremely friendly and polite. He knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. Not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. He even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. 

In all we got to shoot A LOT of guns (9 I believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at Battlefield Vegas. Although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. I definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since I now know which ones I like. All in all though this is definitely the perfect venue for people who have never held a gun in their hands before.",1

You felt like you were in a famiily's back yard (if their back yard was big and beautiful and filled with goodies. I loved that it was dog friendly. What dog wouldn't want to chill on a patio in the fresh air and maybe get a few scraps of bacon. The Bloody Mary was so fresh and had a good kick to it. We also got an order of the Monte Cristo.

trn_1769,"4 Stars for the price to food quality.  The food was great for the price you pay.  The bar has decent priced drinks as well.

HOWEVER....

This place is in the ghetto vortex of the strip.  You know that place from M&Ms world until Planet Hollywood?  That is the ghetto vortex.  Tattoo parlors, porn slappers galore, bums cursing at you for not smiling (really?), those creepy statue people, some lady at a stall trying to sell a towel that wraps around a woman's waist (reallyx2?), some dude with a shirt that has LEDs on it (kinda like an updated bedazzle), and another dude trying to get me to go to the Grand Canyon.  They will ask me ""you wanna go to the Grand Canyon?""  The best thing to do is to reply with a ""you wanna go to [insert horrible city here]?""  I usually use Port Arthur, TX.  This area of the strip reminds me of the part of the Thriller video where the zombies come out of nowhere and scare the hell out of the girl...then MJ turns into a zombie for some reason....everybody dances and things get annoying.  The ghetto vortex is like that.  Kinda creepy and very annoying.

Watch out for the ghetto vortex and eat a burger at Fatburger.  It is a nice change from the fine-dining expensive restaurants.",1
trn_1770,"Been here 3 times. Small size is too small. Regular size is too expensive. Mixed feelings about this place because I think it's too pricey yet I've liked everything so far. I would definitely go more frequently if the prices were more reasonable. I don't want to pay $17 (taxes included) for a lunch that will satisfy me, yet I really love this stuff = occasional treat.",1

trn_1772,"It would behoove anyone who is a thin-crust, Hawaiian pizza super-fan to buy pie here. It is magnificent. Truly.

I'm no ""pizza connoisseur"" or anything but am pretty selective with dough/crust, sauce, goodies on top, cheese, etc. It is blazingly obvious that this establishment uses quality product as they certainly yield a heavenly treat!

We ordered their garlic knots too, but the pizza was so intoxicating that I saved stomach real estate for pizza. 

But, it is quite dangerous as it's a mere 5 min drive from my home. I must eat in moderation here. Plus, our town always welcomes awesome, newer businesses.

That Guy: You have captured my heart. Great job.",1
trn_1773,"We decided to try this place instead of our usual cupcake Shoppe on Yonge street.  We tried the fall pumpkin cupcake with cream cheese icing which was ok.  The cake part was moist, the icing didn't taste like much.  We also tried the red velvet and cookie dough cupcake.  The red velvet cupcake was tasteless and the cookie dough was not impressive either.  I would definitely go elsewhere next time.",-1

I actually went for just a foundation and she did a whole make over for me and I end up getting more than just the foundation :p. If you're looking to buy make up or Lancôme , go see her( Katherine/Kathy). She will make your day, she does not pressure u, she just love doing what she does. That's a true artist.",1
trn_1775,"This was my wedding hall in 2015. Although when I checked it out at the beginning, it didn't look like it would be an impressive hall (it wasn't decorated when I saw it and it was in the process of being renovated), after decorating it for my wedding, the hall looked very nice. Suzanne, the manager there, did a great job of organizing everything in a very short period and on very short notice (2.5 months!!). She recommended the florist, DJ, photographer and the caterer, who all happened to be great and very affordable. This helped a lot considering that I was not from Phoenix and I only met with her and all the providers once. 

The wedding turned out to be beautiful and very organized. I depended on Suzanne and I didn't regret that one bit. Everyone talked about how the wedding was done beautifully, and how the food, music and service were all great! Everyone worked with me and got things done the way I wanted. I was at the end, a very happy bride :)",1

trn_1777,"The hotel itself was pretty nice and in a good location. I felt the the valet parking staff was unprofessional and slovenly. Apparently, that are not employees of the hotel. That said hotel management should take greater care in selecting the staff that will be representing the hotel upon arrival. Even if you arrive or leave by cab or uber, you are subjected to their antics. The rooms themselves are very nice. However, if you like loud, thumping club music book a room on the 2nd floor. That way won't have to leave your room to enjoy it at 2AM rather than going downstairs to join the 5 other guests actually in the lounge.  Also, if you want change for a $20, don't ask at the front desk. They will refer you down three levels to the aforementioned valet parkers. I actually like the Aloft brand, but was disappointed with this stay.",-1

trn_1781,"I just recently went to the VH Spa for Spa Week. Once again, I was pleased beyond belief. The spa area itself is smaller than I would like to truly spend an entire day there. However, the amenities, service and treatments surpass any space concerns. I had a massage this time and it was great. Many times at other spas you walk away feeling relaxed but your pain or issue really isn't resolved. The therapists at the HO all seem to have a ""knack"" at figuring out what is wrong. I would recommend the VH Spa to anyone who wants to leave with results!!!!",1

trn_1783,"The overall quality and presentation left much to be desired. For this price point I'd have expected top shelf on both counts. Shrimp was small and translucent, unappetizing. King crab tasted ok but was small. Split legs were a nice touch. Prime rib had been split lengthwise for some reason and was dry and more done than it should be. Just generally a disappointment. Have and will try other Vegas buffets but this one, sadly is off the list now.",-1
trn_1784,"South Point is a great place to kill time - there's gambling, bingo, movies, bowling, and video games.  My husband and I had a really good time.  It's not a fancy casino by any means, but it's clean and not overly smoky.  The bowling alley is also very clean.  The shoe rentals are a little beat up, but this facility has kept up well.  There are numerous lanes and people seem to be pretty aware of bowling etiquette.  Depending on the time of day, games and shoes go for $3.50/ea.  The lanes are all automated (bumper capable) and there are televisions interspersed if you get bored staring at your own screen.  

The workers there aren't overly friendly nor happy to be working, but they are efficient and willing to answer questions.  We didn't play any bingo or watch a movie, but the slots were fun and not completely begrudging in letting the patron win.  Some food options available here were a buffet, seafood bar, steak n shake, Dreyer's ice cream.

If you're looking for a quick escape from the hustle of the strip and kick back, South Point might be the answer for you.",1
trn_1785,"If I could give them less stars, I would.  We arrived to the festival at about 5:00pm with tickets to the tequila tent.  The tent was shut down, most of the booths were sold out of tacos and we basically left after about thirty minutes.

I have contacted this company three times to get a refund because I didn't get to use my tequila passes and I don't think it is right that I paid entrance for an event that was practically sold out (Hello, stop letting people in if you know that there is no food left.)  I have yet to get a response, so I am hoping this will garner some sort of reply to my request.  

The level of customer service exhibited by the people that put this on is AWFUL. If this issue is not resolved, I, and my group of friends, will not be returning in the future.",-1
trn_1786,"Have shopped here on enough occasions in that as a straight male for one  ? I do not like being pestered by some of the gay male staff to include the mgr .. With a degree of diplomacy I feel he is of the understanding I am not gay ..  Knowing this the check out lady ( pal of his perhaps  )  whom not quite as attractive as she might like to think she is .. I don't care I am not attracted to this woman  .. After today not at all knowing now her personality is contrived .. 

 Somehow because I was less than engaging with her mgr friend   ? That notwithstanding  she ( elderly woman mind you ) I have this feeling from her that I would like to or have made in the past  advances to her ( just by saying hi how are you with a smile in the check out line   ??? ) This while acting as though she somehow thinks all male's are attracted to her I guess   ?  I smile and am respectful to all at any merchant I choose to shop ..

Are we at a grocery store or singles bar or night club  ? Highly unprofessional .. Needless to say she has treated me as though I am this un feeling person whom she makes every effort to show off her build to me or others in the check out line  .. With the attitude she is a gift  to the male gender   ?? Really it was embarrassing .. I am a professional respect should be a  mutual  understanding  ! 

  With that I have refused to partake in these high school acts ( this while shopping  ! ) I have had quite enough especially when the mgr and the woman made fun of me as a paying customer  !  The mgr broke out with a laugh ( while my back was turned to her ) exiting the store where he sits elevated and ""people watches"" instead of watching the dates on the merchandise !  She obviously gestured to him in mock  ! I will not be back I have their names to take this to another level .. 

Moreover several other customers of this store have complained numerous times of  out dated merchandise on this stores shelves .. I know  !

trn_1787,"Came here with the Yelp deal of $17 for $25 worth. I must say, I am quite impressed with the food that they serve here. But every other surrounding aspect of the cafe needs some sort of improvement if not more. First off, the graphical design/theme of the restaurant needs MAJOR change. If I didn't read this about yelp and walked by the store, I would've thought that this joint is some acupuncture office. The Website also needs major reconstruction as well. 

The service wasn't bad but the waitress seemed a bit awkward. Not to say it hinders her performance as a waitress, but she can use a little more personality. 

The atmosphere also didn't really remind me of a cafe or even a restaurant. To me, it looked more like a furniture store. And it was dead silent in there. No music and a TV that wasn't even on. The waitress also seemed to be fulfilling duties that aren't really resembled of a waitress. She was spending way too much time cleaning the place.

I got the Guacamole burger with whole wheat + grass fed beef.. It was juicy and cooked on point. Could have used more guacamole since it is a ""guacamole burger."" But in all, the taste was delicious. On the other hand, my girlfriend got the Santa Fe burger with whole wheat bread and grass fed beef in which was practically the exact same as the Guacamole burger... I have no idea why. Nevertheless, it was very tasty. On the sides, I got blue corn chips. Not enough to fulfill the side that I want but still somewhat good. On the other hand, my girlfriend got baked fries which is an additional $1.50. I recommend getting baked fries over any other side just because I'm a potato type of guy but it really complements a burger well.

Later on, the cook came out and greeted us to check up and see how we liked the food. I felt very welcomed and he definitely makes me wanna come back on numerous occasions. On a real note though, this restaurant needs major reconstruction other than its foods because they seem to be struggling just a little. And to make matters a bit more difficult, they are competing with another restaurant with the same focus of organic foods in Green & Proteins, which is about a quarter mile north from Elixir. Nevertheless, they can see me coming back.",0
trn_1788,I have long been a Filbertos fan but now Amados has sold me on them. The carne asada burritos are delish and my wife loves the chicken taquitos. They have a little salsa bar inside so I would advise skipping the drive thru and eating in.,1
trn_1789,"It's great to see a local business thrive over the years and best of all, retain quality and value of the food. The only thing I miss about going to Jimmy's is seeing Jimmy and hearing his crazy banter.
Jimmy's started out as a single location and now has branched out into 2. The original store has been fixed up a bit to allow for seating upstairs. The store started out as a little convenience store. Food is now the main ticket item; although a small selection of mediterranean staples and sauces as well as spices can be found on the shelves.
I don't think you can beat Jimmy's for value when it comes to shawarmas and donairs. It's chicken or ground beef/lamb compressed into a roast-like shape and slow cooked on a vertical electric broiler that rotates the meat as it cooks, sliced, and put on a pita with vegetables and sauce.
I usually go for the chicken shawarma as I prefer the taste of the chicken at this place. Today I couldn't make up my mind so I went with the combo. My photo shows what you get and that was half way through my meal and each mouthful was chock-full of meat and veggies. They make it as you like it with all the fixin's. One of the things I like is that when you ask for spicy they make it that way. Too often I ask for spicy, and get a whimpy row of banana peppers or a thin strip of hot sauce, but here they understand what spicy means and check with you to make sure that they did it right. A small is around $8.50 and is very filling. It's at least 5 napkins to get you through a shawarma. It's just a bit messy to eat but enjoy!
There is a display case with a small selection of salads such as greek and tabouleh, jamaican patties, meat pies, some cheese, samosas and baklavas and other delicious stuff. Service is quick and efficient. There is limited street parking. Most people come for take-out; if you wish you can sit outside or upstairs. It's a small place so seating is limited.",1

Had it to go.  I appreciate it when they do a decent job packing my food to go and are environmentally friendly (ie. No styrofoam!).

We had the tacos, that came in 3s with a side of nacho chips.

The quesadilla was more like a roundly wrapped burrito and I like how they inserted a hard taco inside/nacho chip like, so it provided a great crunch.

They also sell Mexican grocery items, like cheese, salsas, organic nacho chips.

Will return to try other items and dine-in.",0
trn_1792,"I received a gift card to this place around Christmas and I finally decided to check it out. I've been to GVR many times before but never realize that the spa is located on the side and they have their own parking. FYI, the parking is across Life Time. 

Boy is this place beautiful! There are multiple floors with different amenities and a lot of staff. Place was clean as can be and the staff was very nice.

I came here to get an acrylic full set w/ gel. My gift card was for $100.00 and I pretty much used my whole gift card on this service. I've gotten full sets with gel for many years now, so I'm pretty picky when it comes to my nails. The nail technician that helped me was very nice. We had a steady convo going the whole hour I was there. I would've like my nails more, if the polish didn't chip off after a week. She only put one later of top coat, which I probably why. I was nervous to ask for more, since I really did't know how their pricing works. 

I didn't expect the price to be average like the other nail salons I've visited, but for me to pay so much and the gel color to chip off after a week, is very disappointing. I should've used my gift card on a massage instead.",-1

Forget the dessert and have it someplace, both the Tiramisu (dry cake with some pseudo coffee cream not good and the Mil Hojas was awful, gigantic and all caramel so very cloy ugh....

Why yes mashed potatoes, well if you want that here it's $2.95 extra so now we are at basically $14.00 for lunch. Get my meal and its a little tiny, tiny bowl of potatoes, ugh, ask if I could have some gravy for the potatoes was told sure but thats $1.00 extra. Are  you kidding me. Absolutely crazy.

""Zorba the Greek.""

Did he live inside?  Were Greeks perverts?  What IS Victoria hiding in her panties?

OK.......I'm not sure Victoria's Secret ever really entered into my mind that many years ago (did it exist?)..........but it sounded good at the end of that sentence.

trn_1800,"The annoying thing about a crowded convenience store is that it is no convenience at all.  

This is how it happens for me at least once a month.... It's the end of the day.  I look down and see my gas indicator is creeping to the right and gravity wants to bring it down.   But I, foolishly, make the decision to  drive pass this station and skip the fill up because I'm tired.  I have to let the dog out.  I'm hungry.  I gotta pee!  I just want to get home!  So, I tell myself, ""I'll leave 5 mins early in the morning to get gas.""   

Next morning rolls around...... oh shizzle, I'm late.   I scramble outta bed and get dressed because I have an 8am meeting and I barely have enough time to get  there!  Jump in the car,  open the garage and pull off to work from my house thinking,  ""I can make it to the parking lot by 8, so I'll be 2 or 3 mins late.

That DAMN gas light is on.   

W.   T.   F. was I thinking last night.  I gotta get gas now.  I pull in to this convenience store in a rush and in comes the irony that smacks me in the face?  Convenience?  I think not. A crowded gas station where I have to wait for a pump almost every weekday is no convenience my friend.

I imagine you could get breaded chicken on it to add more texture and buffalo sauce.

trn_1810,"Duggan's Brewery is a great spot for fresh beer and pub food. I've been ordering their stout since finding out how delicious it is, so I don't know yet about the other beers. On the beer menu there is a IBU rating for each of their brews along with the alcohol level (specific gravity). This is interesting to look at as the IPAs which are hoppier are more bitter too, so score higher on the IBU. A wheat or weiss beer is at the other end. Useful!
The food looked amazing with piled high burgers and piles of jerk chicken popular items that I saw when I visited. Everyone looked happy!
They have daily brewing happening in the basement along with some live music with tours available, so it is a happening spot. I first had their stout at Painted Lady where the brewery was sponsoring a Duggan's with free oysters as a promo. I was hooked! This place is worth seeking out.",1

The decor was very sexy, and would be perfect for a date night. Just dim enough to feel romantic, and very sophisticated. 

We ordered: Garlic Shrimp, Grilled Octopus, Hanger Steak, and a lamb dish whose name escapes me. They were all delicious and perfectly cooked. Our cocktails ($14) were also delicious. Now, 4 dishes between 2 people totaled just under $100, which did sting a little bit.. You're not going to be full, especially if you go and you're very hungry.

trn_1818,"I'm organic obsessed! I love Trader Joe's. I love their selection of milk & yogurt. They sell almond, soy, coconut :-) All the things that make me happy!. 

Almost every single time I've been to this location they had killer free samples of food and drinks. It always leads me to buy whatever it is I sampled. 

They have a decent wine selection-- nothing super high end, but they carry all the basics. 

""Mama Grace"" is my favorite cashier. I love her personality and even though her line is always the longest-- it's worth the wait. She will make you smile. 

I just bought a pretty basil plant from there this week. YUM :) 

Trader Joes is a more affordable Whole Foods. It's a must try. I love everything they sell. From the salads to their ethnic section--- it's an A+

My newest unhealthy obsession is their ""Cookie Butter"".. That's right. It's cookie dough-ish spread. Heaven. Bliss. Yum-ness.",1

trn_1820,"Oh my goodness. What a treat this place is! We were here recently and simply loved it so much. You cannot beat the idea of a drive up where someone scurries to your car and takes your order while you leisurely sit and relax and wait for your food. So great.

As for the food, delicious. Old school cheeseburgers and fries and mozzarella sticks, hot dogs, shakes, and even salads and the good old shrimp basket. They have something for every single person here. We decided on the Galley Boy and some fries. The sauce on this was amazing and we were so happy. Also, we added in some onion rings and a salad. The o rings were great and the salad was good as well. Not the greatest, but what can I expect from a burger drive in?

To finish off our meals, we had some vanilla and strawberry milkshakes. They were so creamy and delicious that I still think about them as I type. The service is quick and efficient as each server runs back and forth to get your order and then deliver this. Boy, they are in good shape to do this!

Leave the kids behind, this place is like a perverted TGIFriday's.  The staff makes everyone these weird hats with sexual themes like ""I've been tea bagged more than Lipton"" and the like.  It's actually quite fitting for Vegas.  It's located inside the Excalibur (kinda random) but easy to get to if you're staying at Mandy or Luxor thanks to the tram.  I can't speak to the food, only had a few beers at the bar.  It's a very busy place.  Sometimes there's live music, so it can get kinda loud.  I'd say it's a good rendezvous point for your group to decide what's next for the night.  There's a Dick's Last Resort in San Diego too.  I think that's where it started.",0

trn_1824,"First time coming here, tattoo artist was Eric Alvino. Let me just start off by saying this place is very clean and tidy, very friendly people off the start. Eric did an amazing job on the tattoo on my wife, we originally came in to both get tattooed but he did us a favor and didn't want to charge us the shop min for the little work I needed done as well. Man of integrity right off the start, he wasn't like the rest of the world and just wanted to take our money and be done with us. You can tell he cares deeply about his worth ethic and what he is gonna put on your body. He knows what he's doing will be a representation of his work. So when you go to this guy you are gonna get honest hard work. Because of that I will always come to this guy to get our tattoo work. Definitely not a standard shop where you can go and pick what you want off the walls or photo galleries lol. So whatever you want is going to be specifically drawn for you. I couldn't recommend this place enough! Make sure you ask for Eric!!",1

Room we were shown had lots of interesting ""stains"" on the comforters.

EVERYTIME I come in here I leave with a smile in anticipation for what my taste buds will endure. The parking can be tight but the service is fast and I've never had a problem getting in and out. 

The only think I hate about this place is the hours. Tuesday-SAT 11-4 i'm at work. And the days I want you the the most they are closed.

trn_1828,"Can I give 0 stars? Where can I start? Took my car there after an auto collision thanks to yelp. They kept on pushing back the finish date so I had no idea when I was suppose to return my rental car. Received my car back a week after it was suppose to be completed. Noticed a new scratch on the side of my car that was not there before. I asked them about it and they said they were going to look back at pictures from insurance company and get back to me on it. That never happened. I immediately noticed my alarm was not functioning correctly. Took it back. They could not figure out what was wrong with it and told me to take my car to Acura to diagnose and fix it and insurance will pay for it. Now my insurance won't cover it because they said its not in the location of the accident (I'm assuming they hooked it back up incorrectly or a wiring is loose, or shorted a circuit or its not grounded properly). Fast forward a couple months and my engine overheated (after they replaced a new radiator). They did not clamp the lower radiator hose correctly and now my engine has been compromised due to their negligence and they won't accept the responsibility for their mistake. On top of that my mechanic in LA took a look at the car and said there were a lot of things missing that were itemized on the quote they sent the insurance company and some that were suppose to be new but was obviously not replaced. I almost never write yelp reviews, but I had to on this one. Consider yourself warned and stay away!!",-1

When we returned we found we had been charged $180 which included upgrade costs and additional charges not identified on our online rental agreement. Complained to the company, who issued a response by e-mail that did not address the overcharges but summarily stated, ""Payless Customer Service Representatives are trained to review the terms of the agreement and advise customers of their responsibility and obligations while the vehicle is on rent."" This did not happen. We arrived at the Payless Service Desk earlier than anticipated. The CSR tried to upgrade us to an SUV and we declined and said we would come back at our scheduled time. The CSR asked us to wait saying he had found a car. He did not indicate it was an upgrade, and we had specifically declined an upgrade when offered. He did not review the terms, but rather simply offered us the rental agreement indicating where we should initial and sign. Perhaps we should have known better, but we were not expecting to get scammed, and initialed and signed where indicated so we could get to our sick relative. Long story short, they overcharged us and added unnecessary stress to what was an already difficult trip.",-1

They have adult bunnies, baby bunnies (not retaliated to adult bunnies) and guinea pigs all horribly cramped in the same cage. I've gone there twice because I couldn't believe what I saw the first time.Their water is always filthy and I've never seen a strand of hay once in any of the rodents enclosures. My friend and I personally refilled most of the animal's water bowls because it was so filthy. Even the ducks there are only given water three times a day because they, ""waste water."" They're ducks people! All of the rodents nails were over grown and I held four bunnies and I could feel all of their bones. I even bought a baby chicken from that store just to save it's life, because he was lying on it's back being stepped on by all the other baby chickens. I hated to give them money they definitely don't deserve but I couldn't watch that animal die. Later that day I discovered he had hemorrhoids, this chick was only a week old. There is only one employee that isn't a complete jerk; the woman that gave me the chicken told me he had no chance of living and that birds are stupid anyways. I loathed giving them my money, but now the chick is happy and healthy. (If you think I'm over reacting please took at the photos I have posted on their photos.)",-1

trn_1834,"As my it was my first visit to Taste of Calgary, I was happily surprised with the festival.

I have to say that I don't agree with the majority of reviews currently posted. First of all, being a festival you have to recognize that you probably won't be saving money by attending one of these events. There were also a lot of people there and you could easily find the most popular items based on lines alone. I sampled and enjoyed many of the food dishes as well as a lot of the samples available in the liquor area. Being that it was a few weeks ago now, I can remember the one thing that stood out for me and that was the watermelon juice with mango pearls from Bubblicious. I would never have known about this place as it is located so far in the North East but now I will go out of my way to travel there again some time.

I had a lot of fun at the Taste of Calgary and got to enjoy many dishes that I would have otherwise avoided. I'll be back next year.",1
trn_1835,"3.5 stars for Dimmi! As previously noted, it's a tasty, reasonable option for Yorkville. Great date, BFF-hang or business-lunch spot.

I've been here approximately one trillion times and I have it down to a science: go with a friend so you won't have to decide between pizza and pasta, and get both. Or two pizzas, one red and one white. Done-zo.

My go-to selections:
- Rigatoni al Gorgonzola (mushrooms, roasted red peppers, cream sauce)
- Pizza Salmone (smoked salmon, arugula, red onions, capers, cream cheese)
- Pizza Gorgonzola (gorgonzola cheese, red peppers, olive oil, figs, honey)
- Gnocchi alla Dimmi (rose sauce, asiago)
- Tagliollini alla Gamberi (black tiger shrimps, arugula, cherry tomatoes)

Both of the gorgonzola dishes are delicious and rich but your stomach will magically find room for it.

The quality of service varies. They ding you with a charge if you split a plate over drinks, sometimes aren't the friendliest, and occasionally snatch the bread away before you're done with it.* Once I did have an awesome waiter, who presented us with a big thing of COTTON CANDY at the end of our meal and totally made my night. Sadly, the service hasn't been as great since, despite multiple visits. Love me, Dimmi! I want to love you.

trn_1836,"Let me start by saying that I have only eaten the lomo saltado which is meat and French fries and I think it's pretty damn good.  When I eat at the restaurant they serve you some kind of peanuts and they are yummy.  On to why they got knocked 2 stars. They serve the food with a green Chile sauce.  I have eaten Peruvian food before and I literally drench it in that stuff. We just ordered to plates of lomo saltado and we specifically asked for more of the green sauce. They gave us 2.  My wife asked for more and they said no. I have been to the restaurant a few times and we have this discussion every time. I ask for as many of the green Chile sauce served in those tiny containers and each time they bring out 1 or 2.  When I complain and ask for more they tell me no.   I'm always told no because they say they didn't make enough. There is a great Peruvian place called mamitas in Glendale California I use to go to all the time and they served that stuff in a squeeze botttle. I would drench it in that stuff.  I love love love that sauce so when these people are so damn chinsy it pisses me off.  At first it was a laughing matter, kind of a joke but I'm eating my meal now and I wish I had more. You guys need to make a ton of that green Chile and never tell your customers they can't have anymore.  Stop limiting my green Chile.  It's ridiculous.   You would get he 5 stars if you gave me more Chile like I requested. I'm not used to being told no over condiments so this whole situation is kray. Make more Chile and keep your customers happy. My wife is scrapping the lid right now and this little container we isn't even filled half way!!!!!",0

As an artist this store caters to my every creative idea and inspires new ideas with every visit. If you are searching for buttons, candles, stickers, albums, frames, photos, wood work, special adhesive, colored duck tape, glitter, wire, canvas...whew..and anything you can pretty much imagine, stop at Michaels! 

Be sure to sign up for their on-line coupons though because without the additional discount, your shopping could potentially break your bank if you have compulsive habits to splurge just as I do. 

My best suggestion is (aside from the coupons), enter the store with a list, an ultimate goal, map the items out in the store (if you're familiar with the layout) and be sure to bring in only the cash you wish to spend ;) 

Thanks Michaels for encouraging creativity and originality!",1

trn_1849,"So disappointed in this hotel. Not worth the price...
For my sisters 60th birthday we decided to upscale it a bit. I was embarrassed and so disappointed in our whole Venetian Experience. The only decent part was maybe walking through the Gondola area, but any one could do that without spending $300 plus dollars per night. I will add some photos we took of the pool, spa area...Horrendous....I have never seen such a mess at a pool area....
the next morning we came down again and found some of the same items still laying at the pool...we decided not to stay at the pool since it was hard to tell if the towels in the clean bin weren't mixed with dirty towels. Each day we went down and it was already 9:30am...so plenty of time for staff to have the area cleaned the area.
We arrived Sat. and checked in our room. Our friend had an adjoining room. It was hard sleeping that night because the AC wasn't working properly, and was making a loud rattling noise. The bathroom door hinge was missing so we could not close the door. So much for privacy. Also some of the lamps did not work...needless to say we asked to be switched to a different room. They told us they would upgrade us from the 4th floor to the 21st with a view. 
We are in Vegas so we decided to visit some of the sites. At 2pm our friend had a text that her room was ready and she needed to ck in by 2pm. so we all rushed back to the hotel to change rooms only to realize our adjoining room was not ready. We had packed all of our things and brought it up to her room anticipating that our room would be ready soon. We sat around waiting and by 5 we had to leave for the MJ show...there were 6 girls all trying to get ready in one room...needless to say, no one got to shower and really get ready for a night out. We missed our dinner resi also....at the time we were leaving 5pm, the maid was finally getting to the room for clean up...5pm!!!! Meanwhile we had called management several times in regards to getting our room and they said they were sending someone up....when we were walking out I asked the maid if she had gotten any message to rush the room and she said no. We got back to our hotel at 12pm. We had to move all of our things from one room to the other. We were upset that we really did not have a room most of Sat! They offered to give us $100 towards amenities!!! Meanwhile, it took 2 trips before keys worked...anyway I can go on and on...but think twice about booking here...we paid quite a bit for a room here, and our friend got the same room on Hotwire for 1/2 the price, but regardless...not worth it..Management did not react or try to help out...they were full of excuses...

I returned a week later and low and behold the same exact fabric was on sale for 50% off!!! I forgot my debit card at home and I was traveling with very little cash.  The sales manager saw my dilemma and offered to put the fabric on a 24 hour hold.

The operation at Body by Kotoske is a complete joke. From start to finish it has been a horrible experience and I do not see one shred of how anyone could leave a positive review at this center. 
Surgery was scheduled for a Monday, and because the employees here were not doing their job and did not get the correct paperwork from all sources needed surgery was rescheduled for Tuesday at 7 am. The doctor was over 2 hours late for surgery with not an explanation or apologies. The initial post op appointment resulted in a large layer of skin being ripped off from the dressings, an extra pain and added stress that was unneeded due to carelessness. 
The week postoperative appointment was also a nightmare. Appointment scheduled for 9 am and again over 2 hours with no explanation other than the doctor is still in surgery.

I've been here a couple of times and had a similar experience every time. Honestly I only come here if Best Buy or Amazon doesn't carry something and I need it right away. 
Back to my experiences at the checkout lanes.... Its been terrible every time. Every time greeted by someone who looks miserable and hates their job. Honestly its not their fault if they are all so upset it must be something not being addressed by management. 
Their price match policy is also lame, I had a few things I was price matching however the girl that helped me at the front was super rude and said that the product sku had to be identical to the sku they sell in store for them to price match. Even if the item description is identical. The issue here though is that some retailers will change the sku to accommodate the way they do inventory.

The coffee itself is decent, and the motif here is--you guessed it, a ""mighty"" sized beverage to keep you buzzed all night. There's a wide variety, and you can compliment your drink with a small menu of cakes, pastries, or hot sandwiches.

The look of the place is...well, antique. It's an old house. Nothing fancy. Everything artsy. If you're trying to rebel against mainstream coffee, this is a great place to start.",1

My favorite is their Florentine special - yummy spinach, mushrooms with eggs and hollandaise.  How can you go wrong?  I love their grits, and they serve a big bowl with lots of butter.  I know - it's so bad/good, but I only get them once in a while. Guilty pleasure. 

My husband loves their protein pancakes - they are really flavorful.  He also loves the chorizo and the way they will deep fry the hash browns for you.  And now they have mimosas and bloody Mary's available.  Heaven.",1
trn_1868,"Ye be warned, it gets crowded at peak times. Large parties like to go there.

Pros: set up is good. Staff is friendly. Plates were cleared quickly. Server even went to find my mom a cracker for her crab. Good options. Dessert was yummy. Lots of tiny portions so you can try a lot. The peach/mango trifle thing is the bees knees. Prime rib was juicy and cooked right. Not fall apart texture, which for a roast it should be, but close. Wine and beer included in fee.

Cons: bathrooms. None! They are outside in the casino. Kid almost peed her pants before we got there. Mind you, the walk is short for an adult. Potatoes had ZERO flavor. That's hard to do. Even just a little salt is ok. Mac n cheese was old and cold. Potatoes wedges were burnt. Steamed rice was old and crunchy. I waited for 10 minutes for someone at the Asian station to replace it, but it was like a ghost town. 

All in all, it's not awful food. But $40 per person is loony toons for what you get. If you aren't eating steak, lobster, or crab, save your pennies.",0

trn_1873,"Back when I was an undergrad at Arizona State, I took some classes at MCC as to avoid further blemishing my school record at ASU. I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC. 

One fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... ""are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?"" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.

I do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking. 

Overall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.",1
trn_1874,"Went with family. Food was EXCELLENT. Flat Iron Steak was perfect. I have been cooking with charcoal grills for decades and I know how hard it is to cook a PERFECT STEAK in a wood grill. I loved the bone marrow appetizer. I recommend the wine Colome, from Argentina, Malbec. It was a great complement for the steak. We ordered dessert to share and the caramelized bananas were GREAT. The apple tatin was to DYE FOR.
Overall a wonderful evening. The staff was friendly and willing to accommodate your requests promptly. They gave us fresh silverware a couple of times. That is something you don't see often. Price wise was very reasonable so we left very happy. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!.

trn_1875,Good selection prices are ok on most items competitive on some. You can find just about anything electronic related and more there. My only gripe with this place is the amount of employees it has. Too too many at once seriously they're too many in all departments on a Monday afternoon.  I can see this amount on a Black Friday sale. My advise get rid of 20-25/ of your over staffing and with the payroll savings lower your prices. That's all folks.,0
trn_1876,"Wow, this place is like nothing I have experienced before. So many choices... They only have a few menu items but you can personalize them however you like them. Kind of like an upscale version of that chain of sub shops.

It was pretty intimidating at first, you could tell the regulars from the newbies like me. I stepped back and listened to a few other people order before I jumped in.

They specialize in enchiladas that they make in a little cast iron skillet so when it comes out of the oven it is hot and melty. It was really great food and I definitely felt like I needed to come back and eat there again. My wife ordered soup and it was really good too.

In Midtown Phoenix, there are a ton of choices to eat and it's nice to find someplace that's different from all the rest.",1

trn_1880,"A nice addition to the douche district! A few blocks away from work (I REALLY like where I work), and offering very interesting tea selections, I am already hooked! 

I found them by chance (and, please don't tell Yelp managers, but they do offer deals almost everyday on premium teas via a Toronto-based deal site, who doesn't love cheap  awesome tea?)  after tasting their teas at Moksha downtown. The COCOA TEA O-M-G. I bought a bag and it lasted less than a week. Perfect for the season!

I am willing to spend money on their matchas and more of the cocoa tea. It's basically cocoa shells, I suggest mixing it with a base tea, and adding some milk to get a delicious tea latte. But if you want a skinny hot cocoa, just make a tea of cocoa shells and pour some steamed milk on top, IT ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER THAN CARNATION, I SWEAR. 

They could be better, though: they could offer more tea accessories (the basics: paper filters, tea tumblers...) and it's very small, so you will probably order tea-to-go. I hope they grow and offer more products and space for their customers, it will be awesome!",1

Ordered a little bit of nigiri for the bait-eaters among us - the salmon was really good.  The maguro was a little off that night.  The ebi was good as always.

My wife got the Ahi Ahi roll - I tried it and thought it was a tad fishy (see 'maguro was a little off' above).

The rest of us tried Ramen - 2 spicy old school, and 1 tonkatsu.
The ramen was pretty good.  Broth was nice.  The pork chatsu was really good - thick and tender and flavorful.  The egg was closer to soft boiled than soft, but not bad.  Noodles had a nice chew to them.  We all enjoyed the ramen!",1

We went to the counter to order, and were told that Super B Burrito was no longer honoring the Entertainment coupon out of the 2017 Las Vegas book. The gentleman at the counter was very nice and said that he would give us a 10% discount instead, and that the new management was not honoring the coupon. We politely told him ""no thank you"" and walked out. This is so short-sighted of a restaurant-- not to honor coupons. That's what brought us in there! I imagine most people would have simply ordered and paid the full price minus the 10%, but we left on general principle and will not return. If we would have liked Super B Burrito, we might have become ""regulars"" there, as it is pretty convenient to us. Now, they will never have our business.

The prices are moderate, the food always tastes the same no matter who is cooking, good. The food is flavorful and I've ordered many different items on the menu and they are all delicious. The happy hour is amazing. Sundays during football season are a little crowded but that is to be expected, and it is not because it is full of ""homeless"" people like one of the reviews by Anthony stated.

trn_1890,"Went here for breakfast on recommendation from a friend. Had the Bacon Vodka Caesar and the Toronnah (classic eggs Benny). The Caesar was tasty, and presentation was excellent with a slice of bacon, pickled asparagus and olive garnishing it. Tastes like they used some sort of low-quality bacon flavouring in the drink though (perhaps bacon-flavoured vodka?) which makes this not so great of a deal at $10 IMO. The benedict was cooked perfectly, not too runny and not too hard. The home fries were a miss. No flavour to them at all, they could really use some seasoning or accompaniment. All in all everything was good, not great. At the prices they're charging for it though, I don't think I'd go back.",0
trn_1891,"I stayed at Hooters Hotel for about 4 days and ate here at least 3 times. Their fries (regular and seasoned) weren't great, neither were the shakes, but the burgers were buttery and delicious, particularly the jalapeño crunch. They weren't dry at all, which is often my main problem with burger joints. They included fries or cole slaw and were very reasonably priced, especially considering the city you're in. The cherry limeade was fantastic the first time, but very watery the second, so I'm not sure what's up with that.

Beautiful fireplace as you walk in. Comfortable seating even with a large number of people. Large selection of drinks I had cider and friends had a variety of mixed drinks. I ordered the teriyaki steak with garlic mashed potatoes It also came with a side of beans and peppers. Food was delicious I loved the teriyaki flavor on the steak and it was juicy and cooked to perfection as medium not too rare or over done! Also the potatoes where to die for yum! Great service the waitress was very helpful in meal choices as well as offering ideas for after dinner. We weren't dressed up even though it seemed a classy place no one made us feel uncomfortable with our appearance.

trn_1896,"I was totally pissed by the servant at Cold Stone tonight. I kindly asked him a question but he gave a cold response:""I do not understand."" I was a little bit angry about it because he does not show his intention to understand it. Then I let him help other customers. When I was ready to ask him again, he still gave me the response: ""I do not understand."" I know he is busy but he should still try to serve the customer. He could answer me by saying ""do you mean..."" If he really does not understand. The atmosphere of a successful store should be happy because the products are the medium to pass happiness to customers. I was about to rate this experience with 2 stars honestly but he realized my anger. He offered me with a little extra amount of the ice cream and coupons. I did not accept the extra ice cream. As a honest customer, my main care is the attitude of the service, which is more important than material make-over. However, I still would like to increase my rating since he realized my feeling. 

Lastly, squirrel hill is a very diverse neighborhood. There are lots of people who do not grow up in the U.S. Compared with traditional ice cream shops, Cold stone has its unique selling point - you make your own. This is wonderful. However, the unique selling point for lots of non-native English speakers is a challenge. It is important for the servants at the shop to be patient and to teach the customers how to make choices. Honestly, if customers are conservative, they might have really bad experiences at the beginning and they will never come to Cold Stone. 

I know I might be a picky customer. However, if you think of any chain with long history, it value its service as important as its products. For customer, both are equally important. Please, be aware of that.",0

trn_1898,"My husband and I used to frequent the Village Pub in Desert Shores for years, but after a really bad experience, we never went back. Over the weekend he said he wanted to give this location a try, I was a bit hesitant but gave in. 

When you walk in, you have the bar to the left that's closed off with doors, to the right  there's a separate dining area. We were allowed to sit where we wanted.

We ordered the following items for dinner:

- Stuffed potato skins ($6.49)
-Pot pie ($8.99)
-Steak and eggs ($8.99)
- Chocolate brownie ($4.99)

The stuffed potato skins were really crispy, they were stuffed with cheddar cheese, bacon, and to my husbands dismay, chives. I have no problem with them but he picked them off. They were served with a side of ranch and sour cream. I had the steak and eggs for my entree and my husband had the chicken pot pie. His pot pie was amazing, it was really rich and creamy. My steak was really tender and juicy, what really stood out were the potatoes, they were well seasoned. I still had a little room for dessert so we went with the brownie, it was loaded with whipped cream, drizzled in chocolate sauce, and topped with ice cream. I need that brownie in my mouth for the rest of my life, it was so good. 

Our server server for the night was Brenden, outstanding service from him and his fellow co-workers, they would all check up on us and ask if we needed anything, plus they were all very friendly . I'm a fan of this location now, great food and service, I'll be back.",1
trn_1899,"We normally stay at a lesser expensive hotel and it's been quite some time since I stayed at a Hilton, but this was a good stay.  We were here for 4 nights during the Thanksgiving timeframe visiting family in Henderson.  This was close by and there were 3 other family units also staying here at the same time.

Loved that you could check-in before you actually got to the hotel and choose the room.  This was pretty nifty.  Fredrick was the guy we dealt with the most and he was absolutely fantastic.  He was super professional, friendly, courteous and made us feel like valued guests.

The rooms were alright, maybe slightly narrow, but that's probably common in many hotels of this type.  The bathroom sink and bathtub could use some drainage clearance as they were slow to drain.  The curtains didn't close completely so you could see some light coming through when it was light.  I guess we could have bought some clips to keep this closed.

Nice that the rooms had a mini-fridge and a microwave.  Comes in handy when you're here for several nights.  The bathrooms were roomy enough, so not too bad.  The doors could use some WD40.

I worked out in the gym all 4 mornings we were there.  The gym was spacious with 3-4 treadmills, a couple ellipticals, and a handrower (I think).  There were also 2 cable machines with some attachments.  They had yoga mats, free weights (DBs) from 15 lbs to 60 lbs.  Wished they had some lighter weights like from 3-12 lb DBs, but I just improvised.  They also had medicine balls and a weightlifting bench.  

What would have helped was to have a sanitizing wipe dispenser to wipe down equipment as I was completely drenched in sweat with my workouts.  There is also a TV in the room and some cloth towels near the TV.  It's a nice sized fitness center compared to some other places that hardly have anything.

The decor of the rooms and hotel are modern and nice, but like typical places of this caliber.  Loved the NO SMOKING throughout the hotel.  It was quiet for being 95% full for the hotel.  The elevators worked well.  There were plenty of baggage carts available.  Parking was a bit strange for the hotel, not that big, but we always seemed to get a good space nearby with no issues.  Security seemed fine.

All the hotel staff we dealt with, mainly Fredrick and Jason were totally awesome.  We also dealt with the some of the cleaning crew, which mainly spoke Spanish.  All in all, the rooms were cleaned fine.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad, either.

There were different cuts of beef and tripe and beef balls. See the bun (vermicelli with dipping sauce) was refreshing.

Until 2001, my family had lived in the east coast US, and so I became accustomed to a certain form of Italian American food. Few places this far west have measured up- until we found Payless Pizza. 

The pies are the genuine article. The pesto pizza is amazing. The ranch, made in house, is wonderful; but don't even think about ruining a perfectly good order of Vinnie's garlic knots with it. For those, you'll want to try the equally delicious marina. Truthfully though, you can't go wrong with an item on the menu. Crafted with  real ingredients, prepared with passion, every bite is a testament to the love this place feels for authentic east coast Italian food.

trn_1913,"The first thing you need to know about this place is it is geared towards families with kids, they always have birthday parties going on and they have games in the back where you can win tickets and trade them in for prizes, so if you don't like eating around kids, avoid this place right off the bat. 

I would imagine this place is great for said parties and families. I have no idea what kind of service they provide for parties, so if that is what you are interested in ignore this review. 

I don't have kids but I do enjoy pizza. It was around 3pm on a Saturday so I figure we were probably in between most larger parties. There were still several families already eating and kids running around but nothing terribly crazy. 

Ordered a large pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni. You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer, when it goes off you go up and pick up your food. I liked the pizza, it had thinner crust (but not ""thin crust"" style) and even though it was basic, sometimes that is exactly what I'm looking for. Nothing gourmet, nothing fancy, just some good old pizza that isn't from papa johns or Pizza Hut. I definitely think this pizza is better than that, but it just depends on how you like your crust. 

Overall a nice casual place for easy pizza. But be prepared to be around families and don't expect anything fancy.",0

trn_1919,"Had the new Haddock sandwich. Very tasty!  Nice addition to the sandwiches and pastas.  The value here is fantastic - no entrees over $9 and amazing bread.  No white tablecloths, but if you're looking for a casual atmosphere and really quality food, this is the place.",1
trn_1920,"Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! The only reason I went here was because Miller's Ale House was packed for Monday Night Football. They seemed to have decent specials, but the worst service. 

We had a party of 8 and were drinking and ordering food in front of the big screen. We constantly had to wait forever for any food and drinks and had to get the terrible server numerous times. Food sucked and tasted like crap. The only good thing was the beer. 

Long after the game was over, we were waiting for our bill and to pay which literally took us getting the manager, who was just as slow. 

Good bye! This place is done and will not last long at all. STAY AWAY!!!",-1
trn_1921,"First time eating here, saw the good reviews and thought we'd give it a try.  We enjoyed our meals and drinks!  They served the food quickly and it was delicious.  Plenty of food - enough for leftovers tomorrow which was nice.  The quality of the food seemed good as well, meaning the chicken and shrimp was both plentiful and juicy.

We definitely plan to come back!",1
trn_1922,A fun place to go on a Friday night. The hibachi chefs are energetic and always in a good mood. Food is excellent and cooked perfectly. One of Aurora's best restaurants.,1

trn_1924,"when I made my original review, I only had the burgers, which weren't really a standout. but since then I've found myself returning for the other items on their menu. For breakfast, they make a mean breakfast sandwich, and for lunch, the lunch boxes are a really good ""healthy"" option. so, the burgers are still status quo, but the other things on the menu are the standout items in my opinion.",1
trn_1925,Had a great experience here.  Ed was very helpful and friendly. I can't wait until I can come back,1
trn_1926,"This is my second time here. The first time when they first open I came for a birthday celebration but the service and food was terrible. Our sashimi was frozen. 

However, they have improved. Came for dinner for two on a Friday at 6 pm. Parking lot fills up fast since there so many businesses in the complex. The front host wasn't attentive stood there flipping through paper while a line formed. Not until the lady in front spoke up did he started to seat people.

The atmosphere at this restaurant is open and modern. Lots of seating and clean. The waitress was friendly and came by often to get our order. The food was really good. We love the beef tataki the most. Portions are small but that prevents waste. 

It's a bit expensive for deluxe all you can eat is $35. Overall all the sushi options were delicious and I would come back.  For the sweet tooth lovers there ice cream for dessert!",0

trn_1928,"Growing up, the Greenland Supermarket was a Lucky's, and little bit later an Albertson's. However, just like everything else on Spring Mountain between Rainbow and Decatur I barely recognize it anymore. Chinatown is getting quite epic. 

This is a review of the food court:
In the Greenland Supermarket food court there's a Hawaiian place, a Sushi place, two Korean booths, a Tofu ""casserole"" place (which I don't think I'll ever try, it sounds kind of disgusting) and a coffee shop which serves Boba but seems to be out of it a lot. 

I really wish the Hawaiian place served lumpia and Portuguese donuts but I digress, the spam musubi was quite delish. The sushi place is pretty cheap, for $1.99 they will give you two nigiri, which is about ten nigiri for $10. I also tried Korean food for the very first time when I came to this place, just for the hell of it. I had a kim-chee and meat stuffed bun, which will have to grow on me sadly. It tastes very good at first but the aftertaste is pretty odd. 

In conclusion, I had a pretty good experience here. I wish they had a little more variety (such as a Vietnamese booth or more offerings at the Hawaiian booth) but I will definitely return.",1
trn_1929,"I never yelp fast food, but I love this Taco bell. Great customer service, quick and never mess up on orders.

I have only used their grooming services and I've never done a dog wash but the groomers here are fantastic. 

I used to take my dog over to this awful place in Henderson that had great reviews but the place was awful and kept my sweet puppy for at least 4 hours each time! Wth. 

Barking dogs understands that dogs get stressed out in this kind of environment and only keeps them for as long as it takes for the groom which for my yorkie/schnauzer mix takes about 1 hour 20. 

He always comes out looking exactly how I want him to!",1
trn_1932,"Went on weekend after dinner.  Not too full.  We ordered matcha, mango and original.

Liked mango the best.  The shaved ice here is different from Cha Me Cha.  More like little snowflakes or coconut flakes.  We noticed consistency on matcha, mango and original are all different.

All are pretty flavourful.  One is good for sharing between 2 people - hard for one person to finish one plus it gets pretty boring after 10 bites.

Comfortable decor and seating.  Would visit if I am in the area but would not go out of my way to eat here.",0
trn_1933,"Sketchy-looking location, really nice atmosphere inside though - the outside of the building was definitely deceiving and we almost didn't want to go in.. food was great but too much chipotle in the salsa...waitress was extremely short with us and acted like we were interrupting her day or something - she was just very unfriendly and rude so it kind of tainted the whole experience.",0

My pecan crusted trout was super thin & burnt,  and both of our baked potatoes were way overcooked.  We have eaten at this Black Bear many times, but, today, the food was not that good.  The roast beef was so-so.  Oh, the worse thing of all was the really bitter tasting tartar sauce.  Couldn't even eat it. We may never go back to this one for dinner.  Breakfasts have been good in the past.  I blame their chef & cooks.  I sure hope she doesn't have to share her tip with the cook/chef.  It really was the worse meal we have had in a long time out of all the restaurants we dine.",-1

trn_1937,"This place is awful! I have rented from this location several times over the years and not once has it been good, but this experience has put me off U-Haul forever. A planned move to Fla has been thrown into total disarray because they screwed up a reservation that I made in person and confirmed in person, 6 weeks in advance! The employees are either dumb or just don't give a shit. They're unorganized and totally clueless. I have never used a business so poorly run. How this store stays in business is a mystery to me and any corporation that tolerates such bad performance from a franchise will not get another $ from me. Or maybe they're all this bad. Regardless, I suggest you use Penske, Budget or carry your shit on your back before using U-Haul!",-1

A douche manager
A blatant design

People call me Tabasco and I'll call this establishment Gravy Bandwagon.

FOOD:
I get you are on King St. West harbouring a ridiculously high rent for your 4,345 sq. ft but please do me a favour and start poke-ing that tuna thicker, we will thank you immediately and bring you customers.

SERVICE:
Sir manager, you are a douche depository, totally the opposite of what Hawaiian people are. What's wrong with these gringos, they visit a foreign country and come back thinking they got the secret sauce.

DECOR:
The design is conventional, needs more soul and refined materials, feels cheap.

Exploit the fad to the max.

trn_1939,"Me and my boyfriend came here for the first time for 4th of July lunch. I have to say...Out of this world food and service. We have been to many top rated places while visiting here in Vegas but this place was by far our favorite. The prices are affordable and the portion sizes are huge. The food was so flavorful we just wanted to keep eating. Our server, Nick (sheriff of flavor town) was awesome! He gave us some great recommendations and made our experience here even better. We are already planning on coming back for dinner.",1

First, it seems so much brighter (lots of lights) than I remember and a lot more open. I don't think they have changed the singing animals at all, though. Still plenty of video games and skeeball to enjoy. When I arrived the party had ordered some pizzas. Those weren't too bad. The kids liked them. Now this was the first time I've been here as an adult and I happy to see they do serve beer. Nothing special, Bud, Bud Light & Coors, but when you are surrounded by screaming 5 year olds, you'll drink anything you can! I was slurping those down faster than Richie Incognito could sling a racial slur. All and all, not a bad place to go for a kids birthday party. A good time was had by all.",0

It's malarkey!",-1
trn_1945,"Note: This review is past due and it was for the time I visited during the month of March. 

Incredibly slow service. There were only two people in the restaurant yet we got our god damn pizza 30 mins later. I was very furious. To top it off, there were only two tables that were occupied and 20 or something vacant ones. Anyways, we ordered the BBQ pizza and once we received it, our first bite into the pizza had BBQ sauce dripping everywhere my plate. That is because they basically downed the whole pizza in BBQ sauce. Me and my friend could not even finish the pizza because it was too drenched with BBQ sauce. However, the pig inside me still gobbled most of it since I do love BBQ pizza.

Seriously, I never want to give a place a one star, because unless they actually treated their customers like trash, that would be the underlying decision to give them a one star. They really need to work on their service because I can only imagine if they were actually busy...if they ever are.",-1

We came in with a very large order with no warning.  It was a last minute idea to bring lunch back to the office for a group of 50 working on a project.  The awesome folks at Little Miss were more than accommodating and very helpful.  Our apologies to the individuals behind us in line but the staff were able to get us out and on the road in a very short amount of time.

We had people from all over the States in for the meetings and they all stated that it was the best BBQ that they have ever had.

trn_1951,"Due to the horrible service from the ""Service Manager"" Meghan, I will never return to this location. My family and I have many great experience at this location including friendly service and great food. This time the food was not too great. My mom and dad ordered ribs that came out burnt and very dry. Of course they ate a couple ribs before making a complaint, which we hardly ever do. After I kindly asked the server to bring over her manager so we can address the issue to her, the service manager meghan came and agreed that the ribs were burnt and should have never made it out of the kitchen. She did not offer a replacement meal, instead took the meal and said she will take care of it. When we received our check, I noticed that a partial discount of $6.00 was taken off of the bill. I kindly requested the server to bring her manager back so we can address this problem again. Meghan comes back with an attitude and decided to argue with me about the food. She insisted that there was only a partial discount because my mom and dad ate a couple of ribs. I tell her that sure some of the food had been consumed but over half had to be thrown out and the total inconvenience should have been enough to take that meal off the tab. She decided to interrupt and give me a lecture on how the food should have not been consumed? I told her I don't have a problem with the $6 discount so long as she would have offered a replacement meal! She was very unprofessional, very rude, with a nasty attitude. She failed her job as a ""service manager"" and ultimately made matters worse. Her horrible ""guest service"" was an experience that I never had before, and because of this I will refrain from coming to this location. I'm disappointed it had to come down to this because usually the service and food is great. 
Thanks a lot Meghan.

trn_1956,"I wish I read the reviews on this place earlier, because most of the reviews are about poor customer service and it's true. I was here earlier looking at civics (CPO/new) for about 19k out the door. At first the salesman greeted us and helped us, but told us that our budget was too low. That's all fine and dandy, we left, only to be stopped by the manager (Tony) who tried to work with us. We went inside again to see what he can do for us since he's the manger. He listed several options for us, but we already knew what we wanted and none of the options he gave us were up to our standards. Once we stated our disinterest in the options, he was very rude about it. Saying ""Whatever"" to what we wanted in a civic. At that point I wanted to leave, I have a lot of patience and tolerance with people since I work in customer service for over 10 years. I stayed and gave him another chance because he could have more options for us. We checked KBB to see what's a fair price for a used Honda Civic and we didn't like what he was offering to us. Which is fine, we could've looked somewhere else. But once we mentioned that we would look somewhere else, he belittled us about using KBB. I am baffled at how this guy is in sales/customer service and who is the manager. They really don't care about you or your business. Please Honda, get a new manager instead of Tony. Your dealership deserves better, and it can all happen with better customer service and without Tony.",-1
trn_1957,"Okay, pardon my rage-filled rant, but just because it says organic and local doesn't mean it automatically qualifies for a 100% premium.  I agree with everybody's assessment of the quality of the food (it is very high), that isn't in question.  But I'm getting worn out by the ever-escalating organic premium.  This would be a 5-star review if the owners reduced the prices by 25%.

$6 for a loaf of bread (of which an equally good replacement would be found at Sunterra for $4 - or maybe I'm not fully versed in the ""art of bread"")?  $4.50 for a slice of french toast?  $8 for a pre-assembled pork shoulder sandwich where the pork shoulder makes an appearance on alternating bites?

trn_1959,"I had waited a couple of months before making my first reservation at Lardon and I'm glad I did.  At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.

Four members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:

Cornish Hen x 2
Steak Frites
Duck Confit
Parmigiano Reggiano
Rainbow Trout

Almost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.

As the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:

Steak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.

Cornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.

Duck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!

Rainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!

Unfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.

Though full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:

Creme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.

Mango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.

Chocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.

Bacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!

All in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.  I can't wait to go back and see what the chefs have to offer as the season/menu changes.",1
trn_1960,"I arrived at McCarran Airport for an early morning flight, and was drawn in by the amazing smell of this Cinnabon which is located in the gate area just after one gets off the monorail and comes up the escalators.

While I'm usually a fan of Cinnabon (but not necessarily the calories or the sticky fingers that need to be washed immediately after eating them), I ordered the Cinnabon bites here and it seemed they may have been drying out under the heat lamps a bit too long, because rather than nice and chewy and gooey as they normally are, the bites I got here were rather dry and the outside edges of the dough was actually crunchy, which was something I'd never experienced before at any Cinnabon location.

Only complaints are: would be nice to have a restaurant on the property and time to step up to Lodgenet for in room movies.

Other than that, no complaints. 4.25 stars.",1
trn_1976,"Omg. I can't express my pleasant surprise enough. Dash those preconceived notions of small town restaurants! Great job!

Service: Excellent. We went twice. Both times excellent service by 2 waiters. I wish I remembered their names. Both had glasses. Anyway they were extra helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Kudos guys!

Food: Excellent! Again, I was prepared for mediocre bar food. Whatever you do, don't get the jalapeño cheese curds or you might get addicted like me. And the pizza was awesome. Great crust, great ingredients. Our margherita pizza had some sort of sun dried tomato spread in the middle which was a tasty extra. We totally loved it. My husband had a shrimp dish which I forget now but he loved it too. Nice big plentiful shrimp. The mushroom bake could do without the cheese and have more garlic, but was still very good. Lastly, homemade root beer! You can totally pig out on all the great food. And then pay for it in the gym later....:)",1
trn_1977,"So....they changed their prices. One star because the girl at the counter was sweet. I used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00! I can't afford to go back. I think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck. Be loyal to your customers and they will return. I would have been sympathetic to a dollar more, but that's too high a jump. The pasta is good, but not Olive Garden in California  great. I'll never understand why food tastes better in Cali.",-1
trn_1978,"We went here with friends a couple of weeks back for dinner. 

Mussels are great here.  We ordered a couple of plates, and everyone loved them.  Everyone had main courses as well.  

 As others have mentioned, the beer list is extensive. However, they have only a few beers on tap, and when we were there, a large number of them were Ontario Craft beers.  The international selection was mostly bottled, but the prices were equal to other places that had them on tap.  I compare this place to Bier Markt (where I go frequently) and BM has far more beers on tap, and at the same prices as Beer Bistro charges for their bottles.

The ambiance was nice, and the wait staff were friendly.  

I would recommend this as a nice bar to eat, with a good selection of bottled beers.  However, for anyone interested in beer, I would recommend the Bier Markt any day.",0

trn_1980,"I love this gym!! I have been going to the gym for about 4 years and I know most of the staff. They are always updating their equipment and have plenty of machines to workout on, I never have to wait. The yoga is amazing! I haven't tried the other classes, but I have heard they are great! 

I really appreciate the way the Personal Training department does business. Anthony talks to you about training but doesn't push it on you, if you want it you will buy it. I have signed up for training twice within the 4 years at 2 different locations. All the trainers employed at Mountainside are professional and educated! Right now o train with Devon! He kicks your butt! If you want someone to really push you and less talk, go with him. 

The one thing I recommend for this gym is for the staff to always say hello and bye. Even if you are with someone give me a wave and acknowledge that you see me, that goes a long way, other than that I highly recommend this gym!",1

Well finally got my chance and I was brought back to my childhood. Pinball machines binging arcade lights flickering it was heaven for me.  For a Sunday it was busy just like I remember it when arcades were the big thing to go to as a kid. 

All the games cost a quarter and a majority of the profits goes to the Salvation Army. The Hall of Fame of pinballs is so true, there were some machines I never heard of or seen.

If you are in Vegas for any reason take a trip to this place and get lost for a few hours playing video games like they should be played. By the way my high score on Donkey Kong was 70,400

This time we met friends for brunch on a weekend and the place was crazy busy!! We waited approx 15 minutes for a table and it was another 15-20 minutes until our server finally came to take our drink orders. Granted she did stop by and drop off water (thankfully because it was smoking hot out!). There is a small patio area as well.

The food was consistent as always which is why I still gave this experience the 4/5 stars.",1

The chilli cheese dog was awesome, great chilli! The homemade fries where fresh and hot. The pizza puff which I ordered out of curiosity just to see what it was like wasn't bad at all... more of a homemade pizza pocket.

I do NOT need a prescription, just the glasses. Husband stays in car because I am gonna be that quick. Walk in, male associate is on work phone, I walk strait to the women's sun glasses. Try on a pair. Try on another pair. Older female associate walks in from her smoke break--literally smoking outside the glass as I try on the first pair--and says, ""Have you been helped, we are closing in 15 mins..."" and continues to walk to the other side of the store. My husband walks in at the same time and asks, ""Did you find any?  Have you been helped?""  And my response is ""NO!""  I understand that you are going to close in 15 mins. And that you have lives to live. However, I am a customer, in the establishment that pays you to sell their product. And today, you did a VERY BAD job. We walked out.  The female associate went and straitened the one glasses that I didn't face--and then spoke disgruntling to the other associate. Wow!!

I said i had never used the machine, Judy showed me how to thread it and suggested I take a class.  She recommended this one class, so  I signed up to make a small quilted bag and was told by Judy I would have a nice teacher who would teach me about quilting.  I was also given a list of items to bring to class.  Well, when i got to class, I forgot one item, and was chastised for that, and the teacher was so condescending, she made me feel horrible so I walked out.  I was told when I signed up that this was a great class for me, the teacher would help me... and what a lie... just the opposite.  Are they that hard up for a $10 class?

But hey- if the cashiers don't care about me, why should I go back and care about this business. At $50 a month for my prescription this adds up. I will take my business elsewhere.",-1

trn_1993,"First-- we had a group of 14 and no reservation on a Saturday night... They were able to accommodate us which was really cool! We sat outside on the patio - they have heat lamps and a HUGE fire pit! So it was warm. 

The food was delicious! We had everything going on at our table from lettuce wraps to steak! EVERYTHING was so good! The service was really good too! Super nice, organized, and had no problem splitting the check up. We always had drinks and were being paid attention to! 

After we ate we moved over to the fire pit for another drink before leaving. The ambience is so nice. Very relaxed, friendly, clean (even with dogs allowed). 

I really appreciated them getting us in like they did and taking such good care of my crazy group of friends! 

I definitely recommend the lettuce wraps!",1
trn_1994,"Lebanese Bakery Cafe and Desserts is located on Birchmount Road South of 401. 

I would never notice this place because it is like tugged inside a factory looking complex.

The inside decoration is really simple but quite comfy with plenty of seats and even a little fireplace with armchairs. 

There are 2 areas you can order food from.. one is the bakery for pizza, fatayer(pies), shawarama and salads... We tried some of the little appetitizers ($1 to $1.50) each which are all really tasty. I love the dough! It is firm but fluffy and have a lot of texture. Hey and almost all of them has spice inside! 

The other area is devoted to sweets and drinks. Almond and Pistchio bakalwa. I have to tell you I do have this weakness over flaky pastries. Though both of them are really sweet but oh flaky shells dripping with honey... great to enjoy over a cup of dark arabic coffee...",0

In fact, all of the employees I encountered during my short visit to Evolve were great.

The vibe of the place is great, and I saw some great ""work in progress"" while waiting for my service.  I will definitely consider going back for a cut, and have recommended the place to my husband as well.",1

So many different options for fried rice and beans, also so many different ways you can have your meats. On a plate like panda express, or you can have them throw it into a small quesadilla or small burrito. 

Not somewhere I eat often. But definitely something I'll crave randomly, because the flavors are really good for fast food",1
trn_1999,"It was our first time ""back"" to the previous location of Made In Mexico. The menu is much more slanted towards seafood and the addition of fajitas.

We had guac and chips to start because the homemade chips are the best I've had anywhere. Thankfully they're still doing it the same as across the street.

My wife and I shared the lobster tacos as an entree, which were new to the ""old"" menu and very good. Decent portion size (3 tacos) filled with nicely prepared lobster meat.

For dessert, the churros are a good bet as was the deep fried ice cream.

The Bucket Co is very similar to Made In Mexico. They made subtle interior changes to the restaurant. The menu is quite different but different enough to make it worthwhile.

We like both places and we'll be sure to frequent both places.

Thumbs up!",1
trn_2000,"I've been going to Chapala's for many, many years. I even remember when they were in their old location with the fountain and had a large golden rooster in the middle of the restaurant. Their new location has no fountain or large golden rooster, but the food  is still just as good as it's always been. 

Chapala's service is pretty good it just depends on which waiter or waitress you get. But if you get one of the good servers they will be quick to get you your drinks, chips and salsa and of course your order. I will say no matter how busy they are the food comes out fast and tasty. 

Some of my favorite things to order are the Taco Salad. It's huge and comes with all the yummy Mexican items you want. I love to get it with chicken. It's marinaded in a red sauce that mixes in with the salad. Yum!! When I was younger I'd love to get the special with the two Chicken Burritos enchilada style of course. My friend and I would order this eat one and take the rest home for when we had the munchies later. On my most recent visit I had the ala cart Pork Tamale in a red sauce. The masa was flavorful and soft and the red sauce had a great spice. Plus, it was covered in gooey cheese. Basically I haven't had a bad meal here. 

Craving Mexican food? Hit up Chapala's to satisfy your craving! 
Pro Tip: Mix the mild and spicy salsas together. Yum!",1

I was served everything altogether including starters, dinners and drinks in spite of telling them let me have starters and drink first. I was told that kitchen was fast enough to get everything cooked altogether. After the escalation to manager. They took dinner back and promised to serve it fresh when I want. However, they kept me waiting for the dinner and never served even after reminding the server. Finally, we asked her to pack the dinner and get us check.

When I arrived back from a late night trip from California, I left a very expensive pair of headphone in the enclose center council of my rental car.    Why I left it there? because Enterprise rented me a car that had ready to go Sirius radio (the car was so new, that it had a full service for Sirius), and had a IPod input.   

It was understatement to say, I was dead tired from that trip, and I crashed hard for few days to get back into the swing of things.  When I realize, my headphone were missing, I had to re-tracked my steps; then ran back down to Enterprise a few days later.  When I got there, this Henderson location was busy, and I just waited a few minutes.  When I got to the counter, the same dude who rented the car to me.  Smiled, and opened a locked boxed, which had my headphone.

I was stoked! and this should tell everyone that this location cleans their cars very well, and have very honest employees.",1

And price: it was the same if not better priced than a chain so of course I'd rather something homemade! I got an order of chicken nachos for the kids which was huge. The picture doesn't do it justice--great taste, portion and price. Lastly, the place felt really clean. There is tasty chips and salsa if you dine in. We were there around 3:30 on a Sunday .

The actual pedicure was ok, nice amount of massage and cheap- $25. I did not appreciate the girl working on me asking me things and then talking about me to the other workers. Made me very uncomfortable. 

The reason I'm giving only 1 star is because I now have an infected toe and have to go to the doctor and get antibiotics due to an improperly cleaned and sanitized tub. That is completely unacceptable. I have never ever had any issues with any other pedicure places. This is disgusting. Will NOT come back.",-1

Our waiter was... Drunk? High? He was super slow and had slurred speech. It was hard ordering anything. Then he messed up the beers, and when we commented about it he started sticking HIS NOSE inside the cups!! Like TOUCHING the inside of the rim with his nose, and tipping the cup in a way that the liquids touched his nostrils a bit. He was trying to tell if he'd served the wrong beer or not.

It's 23:30 now. I am such a sucker that I keep poking my head outside hoping it has come. After all, it was marked as delivered to ""front door"" 5 hours ago.

There are a number of appetizers and main courses to choose from, so there is something for everyone. I recommend getting their lobster and crab soup as the appetizer and looks like it is the go to choice amongst Yelpers as well. The puff like pastry on the top of the bowl is my favourite part of the soup and definitely one of the best I have had in town! For the main course I had their Black Pepper Salmon and my friend had the steak with frites. Both were great dishes and the portion for the steak entree was especially generous as well as we had lots of frites left over.

The server brought over a basket of bread right from the start which was great since we were both very hungry. One thing I thought they could improve on was keeping the bread and butter warm, as it was quite cold and hard. Service was great and the food came quite quickly which was a plus.

I love popcorn chicken, BUT when it came the chicken was over fried, it seemed like leftover popcorn chicken that they refried. It was also really hard to cut and bite. We informed the girl who was working and she apologized and brought us another serving of chicken. It was just as bad as the first batch, minus 1 or 2 pieces that were somewhat edible, but still not really.

trn_2025,"The food here was pretty authentic and probably better than most thai places in Mississauga. We had their appetizer platter and it was gigantic and full of goodies. Their fresh rolls weren't soggy and the veggies inside were still crispy. The crispy wontons were crunchy and the sweet chili sauce it came with was a good combo.

As with all thai restaurants I think their pad thai is a good tell on their authenticity and this one was pretty on point. Their chili sauce was pretty good as well and my friend really enjoyed their curry and said it had a good kick to it.

The one complaint I have is their service. It was very weird... i made reservations as I always do and when we showed up a waiter pointed at a corner table for us and said he needed to wipe it. He wiped it and went into the back... meanwhile a waitress comes to the front and instead of seating us, talks to the family behind us. So I though they must have spoken to each other and knew he was helping us... apparently not because she then sat the family at the corner table the waiter just cleared off for us. X_x

We finally get seated and while I was checking in I saw a free thai ice tea offer so asked while we ordered to redeem it. Our waiter looked confused and didn't respond and just walked to the back... at this point I'm a little confused and then 25 minutes later half way through our meal the waitress comes to us and asks me if I wanted the thai ice tea... either they have a weird system or they were just really unorganized. When our bill came, we received the wrong one and when we brought it to the waiter's attention he asked us if we were sure it was wrong?!?!? He didn't seem to know what we ordered even though it was in front of him.

Overall still enjoyed our meal and the service wasn't rude... was just odd. I'd go back if I was craving some thai goodies in the suburbs!",1

Yes the meat/seafood was scarce but it was yummy for 11 pm. Would we go back? Probably not unless we were at Rio. But overall good for a late date night spot ;),0

trn_2028,"I have heard lots of nice comments about this place from my friends so i just want to try it out. 
It's unique place that offer seafood burger/wrap. Especially their soft self crab burger is Fresh Off The Boat signature. Seem like every one who comes here for the first time wants to try this. 
They deep fried the soft shell crab and the flour has spicy taste. I also have to mention the freshness from the crab is pretty awesome. The smell from deep fried coat and fresh crab smell made my mouth water. 
$15.95 include fresh cut french fries and coleslaw, for some people who might say it's expensive but I think it's reasonable price for what you can get. Only thing I don't like is my french fries-presentation was kinda bad . I don't require french fires must have good long shape but it's shouldn't look like I got leftovers :(
My friend had some thing with beef and kimchi in it. Speaking of which, the online menu doesn't include everything. I think FOTB might updated their menu. It's look good but the bread is little too soft. However, kimchi+marinate beef +jumbo shrimps (I think) all together is pretty good. He actually really like it. Btw, his french fries was better than mine =\.
For the food, I would say it's 5/5
For the service, since this is order and pay in front place, I don't know much but the staffs here are alright. 4/5
Most of people come here are 20ish-30ish ( Thursday afternoon), it was busy all the time but employees still cleaned up and refilled the free plastic cups + water whenever they can. 
Decoration is eye-catching, modern western style. From the pictures that I saw, i thought it would be bigger but there are only 22 seats ( yeah, I counted) so hope you can find a good spot to sit or just prepare you might have to take out your food and rat somewhere else.
In conclusion, this is good place to try it, beside the soft-shell crab, I will come back and try something else too!",1
trn_2029,First time here... We had an incredible experience... Great food!!! Service was good...,1
trn_2030,"Out of chocolate croissants?

Heartbroken, I ordered two Almond croissants instead.

The inside of the bakery is small, just a few tables and a counter to order.  We sat on the bench outside, and even though I briefly moped about the absence of my chocolate croissant, I really liked the almond.  

As a matter of fact, it was the BEST croissant I have had ANYWHERE.  It was buttery and crisp with moist and flaky layers.

Some of the almonds fell off of the croissant with each bite, and the pigeons were happy to pick them up for me.  Bonus!

The name of the place is tough to spell, especially if 1) you don't speak French, and 2) have no freaking idea that a Kouign Amann is an edible thing.  Be patient, mon amie, it is well worth repeatedly searching for it on Yelp.  I gave up a few times and just looked for ""croissant.""",1

trn_2033,"ALERT!!!!!  Absolutely DO NOT USE Dependable Auto Shippers!!!!!  THEY ARE CARJACKERS and THIEVES!  My husband contracted with them back at the end of August to ship our car from CA to VA.  To make a long, horrifying story short, to date, we still have not received our car and are essentially having to secure a lawyer, file police report, and figure out what other recompense there is for consumers. Just as other reviews share, they are very difficult to reach and we have had no luck for the last 8 weeks with reaching anyone there or having anyone there reach out to us about the status of our car.  At this point, we are concerned that they never intended to deliver the car (carjacking and theft) and that we will never see the care again.  This has been a complete nightmare!  Stay away from Dependable Auto Shippers and any third party that works with them!  Be forewarned!!!!",-1

trn_2036,We were looking for a place that we could get some tasty lunch to take home to our sunny backyard deck. Not sure what to order so we asked for a suggestion. We were told that everything was very fresh and made to order. We were told we would like it all. We ordered a couple of subs to go.  While they were being prepared the very friendly owner chatted with us about business in the area. We returned home to enjoy one of the tastiest subs I have ever had. I am glad this pace is so close to home. We have been back for there tasty food a few times now.,1

I waited several more minutes and then backed up and left.  I assumed my card had not been charged, that I needed to renew my pass for some reason.  But tonight I checked my credit card statement and my card has already been charged this month.  That makes me MAD!  Bennie is the only one here that provides friendly and good service.  Unfortunately, I did not see him. My biggest frustration about the wash is that when they attempt to towel dry the windows they always end up smeary.

We ordered the following items: falafel, hummus, brussels sprouts, spinach & ricotta dumplings, roast lamb and lamb sliders. Everything was seasoned nicely, but my absolute favorite were the brussels sprouts. They seem to have a highly skilled pastry chef, so order one of everything. 

This is by far, the best mediterranean restaurant on the Strip and should not be missed!",1
trn_2040,"RE Jennifer A's review ***12/5/2012*** Review:  She is entitled to her opinion of the salon and it's employees, however I wanted to post a review from my perspective so that everyone who reads these reviews has a well-rounded mix of information.

I have been a patron of Snapdragon Salon ( and the same stylist) for at least 15 years now and have received excellent service, each and every time I'm there.  My hair looks great every time I walk out of Snapdragon and I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else.  People value different things, so if a person would rather pay $10 for a haircut at a Supercuts type, then that's all good!  You probably spend bigger bucks on other things that matter to you.  How my hair looks matters to me, however, so I go with Snapdragon because I will consistently have beautiful hair when I leave.  Like another reviewer, I have curly hair and up until I started going to Snapdragon I worried every time I went to a salon - curly hair is hard to cut!  I can honestly say that I have NEVER walked out of Snapdragon thinking WTH happened to my hair, or that one side was longer than the other, or whatever. Would I take my child there for a haircut?  No.  Unless there's something very special about my child's hair that requires a master stylist - a less expensive salon will do just fine.  

Also, the staff are very attentive as well and go out of their way to make patrons feel comfortable.  In fact, I have recommended several friends who now are regulars.   

Air Conditioning goes out in this city.  In buildings, cars and anywhere else that has an A/C unit.  Appointments of any kind run late sometimes, period.  It's not just at the hair salon. Communication isn't perfect all the time. Bottom line Jennifer A feels she got bad service.  Maybe she did.  My review is to let readers what my experience has been at Snapdragon Salon.",1
trn_2041,"IVAH is fantastic. Dr. Spense always takes the time to properly answer any and all questions and makes sure to explain any issues in a way that is accessible to the average person. All the assistants at IVAH are equally helpful and supportive. 

My cat has numerous problems that my previous vet couldn't diagnose. After too many visits and no answers from my former vet, I was relieved when Dr. Spense was able to diagnose the issues on the first visit. She's like an animal detective with a bunch of friendly sidekicks. 

Cost wise, IVAH is pretty standard for the area. There are a few less expensive vets in close proximity, but, if my experience is indicative of anything, you'll end up spending more in the long run on the less expensive vets because they won't take the time initially to actually figure out what's going on.",1
trn_2042,"My son and I were very impressed with the food and the service.  We ordered the Breakfast Changa and the Greek Skillet.  The skillet was loaded with meat and vegetables, and the ""Changa"" was huge.  We took about half of the food home.  The servers stopped by several times to see if we needed anything and were friendly.  Also, we ordered the Rustic dessert changa...excellent.  It was loaded with berries, cream cheese, and whipped cream.  We will definitely return.",1
trn_2043,"I was impressed by the decor when I arrived at the restaurant as it looked classy.  We were greeted and seated quickly.  They had a buffet that included western Chinese food including chicken balls, spring rolls, ginger beef, and sweet and sour pork.  But also the non deep fried dishes including chicken and green bean, vegetables, and black bean mussels.  There was also smoked salmon wrapped around cucumber that was quite refreshing.  There is also another buffet line for the hot pot.  First you can choose from about 7 different types of broths.  The items for the hot pot include vegetables, tofu, fish, fish balls oysters, shrimp, lamb, and pork.  There are also about 10 different sauces.  It's great because there is so much variety and you can meet the tastebuds of everyone in your party.  There's also a selection of desserts if you have room.  I had the cantaloupe and it was very sweet and a great finish to the meal, as was the fortune cookie.  For $17, I was impressed with the food quality, selection, and service.  I will definltely be back.",1

I eat curry four to five times a day for a few years now for lunch or dinner alternating between different pastes, and I'm lean. I think coconut milk and Thai food In general is very healthy. I'd eat everyday at delicious Thai if I could afford it. I really loved all the dishes I tried.",1
trn_2046,"The food is good, but the service ruins it, hence the 1 star.

I made dinner reservations for 5 people for 8 pm on Friday, April 18th. We had a movie show to catch at 9.45 pm, but I figured, 1-1.5 hour for dinner should be enough time. Boy, was I wrong. We arrived at 8 pm and 5 of us were seated in a booth for four people. Go figure! After 5 minutes, we pulled a chair for the fifth person. Not a big deal, but you expect better when you make dinner reservations before hand.

Anyhow, it took a good 15 minutes for our server to greet us. By this time, we had our entire order ready to be placed. At 8.15, we place the order. Our drinks were served at 8.25 pm. It was just Kingfisher, so I guess we got lucky there. 

It's 9 pm now, 45 minutes since we placed our order, and our food is nowhere to be seen. We try to get a hold of our very busy, slightly rude or maybe he just had a very dry sense of humor that none of the five people in my party really understood. We told the server that we had a movie to catch at 9.30 and were hoping to get the food asap now. The server tells us that our food is almost here, with no sign of regret. 

10 minutes later, it's now 9.10 pm, our food is still not here. My friend and I go over to the counter and ask our server (who is now the bartender?) and he tells us that we are second in line. Second in line 55 minutes from placing the order? You got to be kidding me! Anyhow, very politely we requested him to cancel our order, since we really didn't wanna miss our movie. Then our server disappears. We get hold of another employee outside the kitchen, requesting to cancel our order. At this point, we just wanted to pay for our drinks and get out of there! The second employee then goes in and 5 minutes later, our server comes out of the kitchen with our food. It's now 9.20 pm! Exactly 65 minutes from placing the order, and 80 minutes from being seated. We literally swallow our food and got out of there at 9.35 pm. Of course, we were late for the movie, and got the 3rd row from the front!! 

To sum up:
a) I made dinner reservations.
b) Got seated in an undersized booth for 5 people
c) Waited for 80 minutes for our food. 
d) Ate our food (which should have been a pleasant experience) in less than 15 minutes.
e) Got late for the movie.

Definitely one of the worst restaurant experiences!! NEVER AGAIN!",-1
trn_2047,"I was staying at the Hilton near the convention center and needed a few items so I headed to the local walgreens. After gathering my belongings I looked up restaurants nearby and yelp recommended The Peppermill. Me and my significant other decided to give it a try. 

Upon entering we were happily greeted by a 70's diner like atmosphere. We were promptly seated and had a super happy bubbly waitress who offered us some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant. She was on top of her game the entire time! 

I ordered the cheese sticks and nachos for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were pretty good but the nachos were out of this world! They were HUGE! (And extremly tasty.) I ordered the peppermill breakfast combo (pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage) and it was excellent. WAY better than a Denny's or chain. The pancakes were thick and hearty. My significant other ordered the salmon and loved it! We ended the night with the brownie and ice cream which was absolutely to die for! 

We enjoyed the restaurant so much we came back for a second round! We ordered Wings, breakfast food and a sandwich (I can't remember the name) with roast beef, thousand island and a few other things which sort of resembled a reuben. We were completely satisfied with both meals and are going to miss this place when we leave! 

If you are looking for amazing food, a great atmosphere, A+ service and a bill that won't leave your pockets empty, I HIGHLY recommend The Peppermill!",1

trn_2049,"Harvest Kitchen is a new american restaurant boasting creative cuisine such as what one would find in downtown. Except, it is at the heart of Solon, voted one of America's top 10 suburbs. With this restaurant alone, I think Solon now is in the top 5.

I do not get the mixed reviews, perhaps the price point? You can make this at home? Don't kid yourself. Let's just start with grass-fed beef -- with a more intense beefy taste and iron-y tone to it. I had the walleye on a bed of lobster ravioli, which was not only inventive, but tasty. One of us had tender beef rib that one could part with a fork, then melt in your mouth.

I loved the environment and modern loft feel to the place. The ambience was busy and energetic. On several trips here, we were seated quick and service was excellent.",1
trn_2050,"**Disclaimer - this review is purely based on their food.  I've never dined in due to the bad reviews about service, and if you live close, I'd recommend getting carry out as well.  Even the little interaction I have with people over the phone seem to indicate that service isn't that great.

That being said, I'm a firm believer that bad service should never stop you from enjoying good food, especially when it's this good!

If you're new to Indian food and want something other than Chicken Tikka, try their vindaloo. We always get lamb, but I'm sure the chicken is great as well if you're not a fan of lamb.  The thing that really makes this dish is the potatoes.  Oh my gad.  They completely absorb the flavours of the sauce and just melt in your mouth.

Wing lovers, you HAVE to get the tandoori wings.  A squeeze of lemon is a must, as it brings out the smokiness of the grill.  

If you want to avoid meat, they have plenty of vegetarian options.  My boyfriend's favorite vegetarian dish is their Malai Kofta - huge veggie dumplings cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.  Apparently this is a really hard dish to get right, and theirs knocks it out of the park.

This is a restaurant my boyfriend would take his Indian mother to - a true testament to how great everything tastes.  Highly recommend!",1
trn_2051,Had the emblems on my Mustang changed. They did an excellent job removing the old emblems and affixing the new ones. Also had some paint work done on my wife's car after an accident.

trn_2054,"Had lunch with family- started OK, chips & dip/queso good. Server started off spilling creamy jalapeno sauce down my sons back and chair- didn't make much of an apology. They don't give side plates out so you end up spilling salsa and queso all over the table. Server wasn't that friendly and patient with people not familiar with menu. I rang ahead and asked if they had many gluten free options (for my daughter) and they said they did- turns out all they really had was some salad items, corn tortillas and cheese- not even rice.
Then they got my sons order wrong - twice, we were finished before he started. Of the adults 2 liked their food and two unimpressed. I had fish tacos- very mediocre and bland, reminded me of 80's style tex-mex- big disappointment given hype of how different they are. Finished the meal with server setting to-go box in spilled salsa mess on the table- waiter needs to find a different job, seriously. Waiter made no effort to right the spills- food mistakes- not coming back.",-1

trn_2056,"I follow things like food trucks on my instagram and this was one account that I had followed to see where they were at and finally one day, they were close enough to me I could scoot over on my lunch break.

So I did what a true foodie would do and ordered a bahn mi and a rice bowl. The bahn mi was pretty good. Not the best I have ever had but overall I was happy. I just prefer my bahn mi on a a baguette vs. a French roll. The meat was seasoned properly but it was just too much bread for me. For me the BBQ pork is greater than the lemongrass pork.

The rice bowl was banging. I added a fried egg, and should have asked if they could have left it runny. This would have made my rice bowl perfect. The pork was cooked well and seasoned righteously. 

Definitely good solid eats coming out of a food truck and one of the best food truck experiences you can have in Charlotte.",1
trn_2057,"Vous voulez vous retrouver au cœur de l'Espagne tout en restant en ville?  Vous serez servis au Toro Toro.  Le service est hyper efficace et l'odeur des tapas  traditionnels venant de la cuisine à air ouverte vous enchantera.  Les dattes au chorizo, les palourdes au poulet et l'épaule de bœuf braisé sont à commander sans hésitation.  On y trouve également une grande variété de fromages et de charcuteries. 
Il ne faut pas oublier la liste des vins où on  retrouve un nombre incroyable de vins espagnols ainsi que de nombreuses importations privées.   Si vous êtes indécis ou que vous ne connaissez pas très bien les vins espagnols, n'hésitez pas à demander des conseils aux serveurs. Ils connaissent leur cave à vin et vous ne serez pas déçus. Pour les amateurs de martini, le bar a tout ce que vous désirez.

Le menu ainsi que la carte des vins sont modifiés et améliorés à tous les mois. Ainsi, il est possible de découvrir de nouvelles saveurs espagnoles à chacune de vos visites.

Le restaurant est sur deux étages. Réservez en bas si vous voulez une ambiance bar et décontractée ou au deuxième pour une ambiance plus intime.  Les vendredi et samedi l'ambiance monte d'un cran avec la musique d'un dj invité.

Prix : les prix des tapas sont raisonnables, mais c'est l'alcool qui peut rendre la facture un peu plus salée.  Mais, après tout, l'argent n'est qu'un détail si vous voulez apprécier de bon tapas!

Enfin,  si vous êtes dans le Vieux Montréal, pensez "" TORO TORO "", car vous ne serez pas déçus de l'ambiance et du service.",1
trn_2058,This place was top on my list during my recent visit to Montreal. The food was fantastic and the cats were lively and adorable. You can tell that they are well cared for by the staff. I had some sort of vegetable concoction with extra goat cheese (yum!) on a deliciously crispy flaky dough that came with a huge side salad. I always say that a good vegetarian meal is one that does not make you miss meat...this was one such meal. The iced coffees are really good as well. I also liked that the tourists were not harassing the cats filming everything with their huge oversized cameras (you know who you are...do you not have cats where you come from?).,1

The owner was great, really friendly and welcomed us right away. Wasn't that busy on a tuesday night. It was very casual and laid back but very beautiful in its design. The music was good, not too loud or obnoxious and the lighting was wonderful. Full bar with a lot of selections, except for Sailor Jerry's which my friend was dissappointed over, but still had a pretty decent list of specials. Overall I say it's a really good bar and I will frequent it quite often, it's much cleaner than Bikini.",1

Choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions, that is set), add your choice of vegetables, then watch them roast it in front of you. I went with chicken and rice noodles, and a ginger garlic sauce. The finished product tasted like propane. The guys frying everything up work hard, but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place. I still like it better than Noodlecat, though, as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Many of the Kanji on the wall are backwards/upside down.",-1

I hear he's changed hotels, but he's staying in Vegas.  You should check him out if you're seeking a show that embodies the City of Sin (without it being an adult revue, though I can recommend one of those, too -- and one that's funny, but that's for another review).

He's got an amazing number of hits and there's probably something innate in me that made me want to go.  Maybe it's because there's a very good chance that he was on the radio when I was conceived.  TMI?  Deal with it.",1

It was quite good, but not sublime. Certainly not in the same league as Burger Bar or Bradley Ogden.
Most notable single element was mozzerella as a cheese choice; I wish more restaurants offered that. 

The service at PJC, however, was some of the best I""ve ever had at a Vegas restaurant. From the host, to the wait staff and busboys, it was : prompt, friendly and efficient. You know how some times you leave a tip because you think you have to...In this case, I wanted to.

And by the way, there is a back-room dining area that is quieter than the more touristy front area, and has a juke-box (free) with some of the best music ever: from Sinatra to Ray Charles to Nat Cole to Stevie Ray Vaughn. That makes everything better.",1

They had free corn-hole so after our two hours were up we were able to get in a few rounds of that before we called it an evening.  We are for sure going to coming back here for future bowling adventures.",1
trn_2085,"Rude management, rude corporate, dirty carpets and roaches & various bugs!!!

Ok so I had an unfortunate issue with the management staff before moving in.  Read my previous review for details. I moved in and there was chunks of dirt as well as grey carpet stains everywhere. I called Rachel the customer service representative who admitted to forgetting to call me back about my customer service issue the previous week, then to cover up her mistake she said customer service at the San Portella location isn't her priority because they are opening a new location. She transferred me to Priscilla who was much more on top of things and helpful.  Apparently Kenny, on the management team, never gave us a form for us to fill out regarding preexisting damages so we don't get charged when we move out.  

When we moved in there was chunks of dirt, grey stains all over the carpet. We made several appointments with maintenance who never came. We have found cockroaches and crickets everywhere. Dirty tile, and sticky cabinets and countertops. 

Hopefully, after talking to Priscilla she will follow through with pest control and carpet cleaning and not forget to call me back like the other customer service representative, Rachel.",-1

trn_2087,"10PM and all the mainstream restaurants are no longer serving.  You hate walking aimlessly through smoky casinos looking for food.
So, if you're me, you walk up the strip.  And walk, and walk.  
Your food choices include Denny's, McDonalds, Harley-Davidson Cafe.
A sign for a new Brazilian-type restaurant shown on the side of the Krave building had me hopeful, but I walked a block in the wrong direction only to find there was no such place.  Arg.  But, it's good to know that if I'm ever looking for boys dressed like girls, Krave is the place to find them...

I digress.  I kept on walking and walking, and ended up at Fatburger.  It was good but the service was crazy slow.

I ate my Kingburger and fries, slurped down my shake, and steeled myself for another long walk back down the strip.",1
trn_2088,"I went to Bianco on a Sunday night for my mother in law's birthday after reading great reviews. The pizza place we love in south central phoenix is closed on Sundays, so this seemed like it would be a great choice. Wrong. What an embarrassing choice I made.The table we were seated at was the round table just behind the hostess podium area, so we were surrounded by constant traffic of people bringing food by us, coming and going. The hostess kicked my chair accidentally and apologized. A waiter walked closely enough behind me to knock my head to the side, also apologizing. A heavier guest pushed me forward when trying to squeeze by me to get to their table. Needless to say, by the 3rd time I had enough. The table shouldn't be there- period.  From the get go, service was disorganized. We were asked for drink orders by 2 different people. Someone later brought the wrong drinks to our table. I don't even know who our waiter was because I don't think we were ever assigned one. The classy glass bottle of water they bring to each table is tap water. The selection is minimal. We ordered a Sonny Boy pizza and another one that was not memorable enough to recall the name. I'm sorry but this is not an $18 pizza.  For 2 pizzas (nothing else!) and non alcoholic drinks for 3 people including coffee after dinner, our bill was almost $70 without tip. If we paid for ambiance, we didn't get it. We will certainly not return. I don't understand the hype and regret making this a birthday choice. We will not return.",-1
trn_2089,"4.5 stars

I'm not sure why the pizza tastes so much better in Madison then it does in other cities where I've had pizza (mainly on the  West Coast),  there must be something in the air. They have some interesting options for specialty pizzas but I'm not a huge fan of greasy fatty foods so I've only tried the  Fetalicious, Thai ,Deluxe, BBQ, and Mediteranean all which were great. They have some great deals online and delivery is free! Pizza from here is never disappointing and whenever I ask for extra sauce, less cheese, or well done they always accomodate. They aren't as cheap as dominos or papa johns but they also dont skimp on toppings and I've never had a problem with their delivery. They have some other options on their menu besides pizza, I've only tried their spinich cheese bread and their crispy chicken and fries both which were super tasty. I've never been disappointed with the food or the service here so I would definitely recommend this place.",1
trn_2090,"Outstanding experience with Payless Sky Harbor.  Everything was top shelf with these people including price, customer service, auto rented, etc.  All aspects 5 star.   
Very concerned when I got a great price online and saw a number of negative reviews.  Started off in a short line at the rental counter when Fox and SixT had long lines next door.  Confirmed price would be the same as I received online for a weeks rental.  No pressure to take additional coverage.  When my full size care wasn't available they gladly upgraded me to an excellent SUV, 3000 miles but like new with new car smell. Checkout was easy and everyone helpful with a smile.  I would highly recommend if renting for personal use out of Phoenix airport.",1

He added the fuel surcharge of $40+ to my bill, despite specifically being told I didn't want that, I would fill the car up with gas myself before returning the car.  He also told me insurance would be $30, not specifying that it would be $30 + taxes for each day I had the car.  When I asked how my $61 booking (on Costco) became a $200+ rental, he told me ""Arizona has a lot of taxes"".  Given that it took so long to wait and then for him to prepare the contract, I did not read everything---I had my 87 year old father in a wheelchair with me.  When I complained to Budget later, I was told, sorry, you signed the contract.  Shady, shady business.",-1

These were really good burgers, and the fries were bountiful and greasy-good.  When a Five Guys opened near my office, I took my assistant out for lunch, and she also became an aficionado.  The food is made fresh, the place is clean, but what really speaks to me is the quality of service - every time I have visited this Five Guys, I have been greeted with a smile, and never has my burger been other than how I ordered it.  This is not an every day place to eat (I wouldn't be able to fit through the door!), but for quick, good, and fun, this is on my go-to list.",1

trn_2097,"Do you have an icon obsession? Do you collect objects from a certain era, an animation character; do you love a certain movie?  Then you should check out Artesano in Inglewood.  They have a huge assortment of new collectables in every shape, size and form, and well presented in a pretty big location.  

Mostly they carry sculptures in resin, almost 80% of the store in fact has this material so you can plunk that sculpture of Betty Boop on the front lawn and she will totally withstand all weather conditions.

So look to them for Disney Characters, Marilyn Munroe, Gumby, Star Trek, Blues Brothers, Charlie Chaplin, Dragons, Insects, etc. Just to name a few.

Honestly this really my isn't my thing, if I did want something collectable I will try to purchase an original version of it from its time rather than a modern reproduction of it but I am sure this store will appeal to some people who are extreme collectors.",0

Its definitely not top notch but its good for the price. Its pretty cheap for a Vegas pizza in my opinion. The only ongoing issue I have with this establishment is when ordering on eat24 it states a 45 - 60 minutes wait time for delivery. Every time I order I am contacted shortly after through the app stating the restaurant needs more time. I don't end up receiving my delivery until 1.5 to 2 hours later. This causes a hungry person thinking their food is on the way to become Hangry. Try them if you are on a budget but I wouldn't suggest delivery, just go pick it up.",0

trn_2106,"My quick tip says it all...over-hyped, over-priced, and the service is terrible.

I think I'm just too old to thoroughly enjoy the beach club scene.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy it as general admission (I don't know if I would have enjoyed it when I was 21 either) so my party opted to make reservations several weeks in advance for a cabana.  We got a ""deal"" through a VIP host but were still shelling out a hefty sum to have a bit of shade and respite from the crowds.  The contract said to arrive by 11:30am to honor our reservation and also stated that if we didn't show, we would be charged $1500 for a missed reservation.  The majority of my group showed up at 11am (when they opened) and proceeded to wait in line for almost an hour.  The line wasn't that long but the promoters outright ignored us and attended to people around us.  When someone finally acknowledged us, our reservation was completely messed up and in order for us to get something similar to our original reservation (but still a downgrade), we had to pay an extra $1000 over our original price.

I nearly lost it when they continued to make us wait...I vocalized my frustration and we were finally escorted to our cabana.  What a disappointment!!!  The cabanas range from $3000 to $10,000 and it's basically just a room and an adjacent day bed overlooking the beach club.  I was grateful to have a cool place to rest when I couldn't handle the heat any longer and didn't want to risk catching an STD in the pool that my friend deemed ""people soup.""  We ordered copious amounts of food, drinks, bottles of water, ice cream, magnums of champagne...everything we could to meet the minimum and cover our cabana fee.  It was the definition of opulence and wastefulness.  I felt a little bit like Marie Antoinette.

Our VIP host found me after we were settled in our cabana and apologized for the confusion but could do nothing about the extra $1000 or the down-graded cabana.  It was an empty apology.  She was contrite with me but gave my husband attitude, saying that she was embarrassed because we ruined her relationship with the people at the club.  I found this to be completely unprofessional and if she had just shown up on time, she could have saved her own relationships.

I really expected better service from a hotel like Encore.  This experience really left a sour taste in my mouth and I would check out the beach club at Marquee over Encore in a heartbeat.",-1
trn_2107,"IN LOVE with their selection! There's a whole variety of pastries, breads and pastries to try from. I love their Black Sesame Roll Cake. I find the price is higher because the quality of their selection is more unique than your average Asian bakery. 10/10 would definitely come again!",1
trn_2108,My third time getting the Szechuan noodle soup and it's still good as prior times. It's $15.00 but always hits the spot after drinking and open till 3 am.

trn_2109,"Why would a vegetarian go to Sonora Mesquite Grill, you might ask. Well, the menu offers three ""vegetarian"" items, unlike a lot of places in Phoenix. What the menu forgets to mention is that the beans are NOT vegetarian. They are cooked with pork. 

I was highly suspicious about charro beans being vegetarian so I asked point blank: ""Are the beans vegetarian?"" The very nice and cheerful lady behind the counter replied, ""Yes. The charro beans are beans cooked with some bacon."" Last I checked, pork and pork products were still considered meat. Oh well.

However, the rice is vegetarian and you can get the three veggie items (burrito, burrito bowl, and quesadilla) without the non-vegetarian beans. 

The only reason I am giving this place three stars is due to my horchata and their salsas.

For $2, you get a large, flavorful horchata with bits of coconut at the bottom. Yum. 

The salsas: Maybe it was just Thursday's batch, but the salsas were extra spicy, so I tossed them in the fridge at home and told my roommate they were his. I think my he drank the salsas as he ate them so fast. He says they are good and spicy and he has been putting the red salsa on everything. Everything.

Overall, I guess Sonora is a meat place; not meant for my kind. So, I do not think I can adequately evaluate the entire restaurant. However, it is very sketchy and annoying to claim to have vegetarian items when in reality, the items are just without meat.",0
trn_2110,"We loved this place!  I spent a lot of time looking on yelp for a moroccan place.  We decided on this one and everything the other reviewers wrote was true.  I was blown away by the Harira soup (Moroccan Tomato, Lentil, and Chickpea Soup).  I would have been happy with that as my main meal it was so good!  Then I had vegetarian stew with couscous and it was fantastic.  A very healthy portion as well for a decent price, especially given the quaint location in Old Montreal.  The meal came with soup, a main dish and then a plate of homemade desserts.  They were excellent, just the right amount of sweetness.  We also had a generous amount of Morrocan mint tea that went so well with the sweets.  We would definitely return to this restaurant on our next trip to Montreal.",1

Service is up there and they even replaced an already half-eaten borderline medium-welldone mignon with a medium (which is what it was supposed to be) for a friend of mine. 

Sides to devour: lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, gnocchi with white truffle oil. 

Aside from their choice wine selection, their main dishes are absolutely fantastic. I had the filet mignon. #1 in my book and I've had filet mignon in many highly rated restaurants in the bay area. 

Their creme brulee (tahitian) was perfect. Smooth, silky texture and taste was perfectly rich enough to rouse the palette yet subtle enough for me to want more!

Honestly with a SEAFOOD buffet the main thing you want is obviously your favorite seafoods and an abundance of it. I don't think you can expect amazing quality from any buffet so I didn't go in expecting 5 star gourmet food.

No guac was on the burrito, just meat and a little pico. The chips were not good at all, they had a chemical taste. How do you mess up chips???? We will not be returning.

I ordered 5-spiced chicken dish for the mains as the waitress recommended that this would have the biggest portion size, but it was two spoonful rice and 3 wing sized chicken pieces.

I didn't love all the food though. Chana masala and saag paneer, normally my favorites, lacked flavor, and saag paneer in particular was just overflowing with grease. I did, however, enjoy all the other dishes I tried a lot, so I'd certainly come here again for buffet.",1

trn_2138,"The casting team and physical therapists here have been very competent and personable. And the other doctors may well be great, but be wary of seeing Dr. Haber. Others seem to appreciate him so maybe it depends on whether he likes you. We found him to be arrogant and impatient.

Our experience with Dr. Haber started off well enough when we first went in due to a fractured wrist from an ice skating fall. Other doctors had recommended surgery but we were hoping for a noninvasive second opinion. Despite a good initial impression, our $40 copay visits have devolved to terrible. At our most recent office visit my wife complained of continuing pain in her wrist and he waved it off with arrogant statements like ""You are fine, just use it normally and it shouldn't hurt."" She has been using it ""normally"", and it hurts. It's been hurting since it was broken, and never really stopped. She has not been taking pain medication besides Advil the first week so this is not an attempt to procure pain medication - we are simply trying to find out why there is still residual and constant pain when the wrist is in certain positions. Dr. Haber did not take the time to listen or make the slightest attempt to understand the pain she is facing.

Now I'm no postmodernist ""it hurts as much as I feel like it hurts"". My wife and I have been together for over 15 years and she is a trooper. She's the type of woman who works hard until the job is done, no matter how hard or dirty the job is - she comes from a family of wake-up-early-work-hard-all-day-with-a-siesta farmers. She is not the type to complain unless it is serious. And when she tells me something hurts, I believe her. Probably ""Dr. Haber"" didn't believe her. For whatever reason. 

But doctors are supposed to listen to their patients, not dismiss their concerns with appeals to authority. The least they could do is admit the limits of their own knowledge and suggest someone who could help. But I suppose that comes hard to those with too much hubris.",-1

Cute little Deli/restaurant.  We had a 1/2 carafe of wine with one of their grill meals for 2.  YUM YUM YUM.  So the negative?  No one really needs that much dead cow...but it was quite yummy with a side gargantuan salad.  Bread with some chimichuri sauce.  OOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  and they have EMPANADAS!  We had a few of those also.  Again, off the strip and this is why people should visit Las Vegas!",1

Several of the people we were working with quit while on our job which makes me think there was something wrong.

I would not recommend them to anyone.",-1
trn_2146,"Sir Ed's is a little hidden gem in Park Road Shopping Center that not nearly enough people know about. 

Inside, the low ceiling and dark accents give this place a total Irish Pub feel. Outside, the patio seating is a nice little quiet sanctuary.

The menu here is very vegetarian friendly with lots of comfort food to choose from. Sir Ed's has a large bar with lots of beers and and an adequate on tap selection.

My favorite appetizer here is the Irish Potato Cakes ($6.50). Two large crusty cakes with a warm herb goat cheese sauce. Delish! 

I usually order the Spicy Asparagus & Portabella Grilled Cheese ($8.25).  This sammich is served on sourdough. It's a nice change from your typical grilled cheese. The veggies inside are perfect, but I wouldn't exactly call them spicy. Order comes with a side, I almost always get the french fries... large ""steak fries"" with a strong potato flavor.",1
trn_2147,"I've driven by Fuku Burger dozens of times, and finally stopped in today.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu burger as a combo.  They say that the combo saves $2.00, and when a small drink costs $2.55, that's not the bargain it might seem.  My chicken seemed to be slightly overcooked, and the advertised katsu sauce was not the type to which I am accustomed.  That being said. It was still tasty.  The fries were excellent, well cooked and seasoned.

So, why 4* when my sandwich was just good, not great?  Well, several things.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The decor was very cool.  Heck, having Ultraman on the ceiling is virtually worth 1* by itself.  They have WiFi.  And, I'll definitely go back again.  We'll see if the rating changes at that point.",1

You have no choice but to use valet parking. I personally don't like the valet process. They suggested to text or call so that the car will be ready by the time I come out but they failed me all 3 days. It just takes too long plus they rush you to go out. 
Besides the valet, everything was great.
The room was spacious and clean.
Had a small fridge to put our drinks in.

But... not all was good. The cafeteria staff was amazing.. the morning shift was very very amazing.. friendly, helpful, exciting.... but.....we dreaded when the evening shift started... the fry cook was the rudest... meanest man.. hes a big african american man, who never seem to wear a name tag. Very unkempt.... very unhappy.... i could swear he hates his gig, and everyone that come up to order from him.. it was bad enough that we had to be in the hospital for three days... but if we ever have a stay yours ever again... we will be sure to have our dinner at another place nearby.. the fry cook made everyone ordering from him very uncomfortable.. especially my family... and we are african american... matter of fact i ordered a patty melt from him... he was so nasty... that i  walked off and got a bowl of chilli instead.  Like i stated before.. it was bad enough that we were in your hospital... we didnt need to feel insulted.",1
trn_2159,"We placed a pickup order here and it was my first time. The online ordering was convenient and picking up was easy. You can place your order for ASAP or schedule a pickup time, it was pretty easy on the computer and on my phone. When you go to pick it up there is a convenient area you walk to and grab your order. You don't even have to talk to anyone. 

I got the Wisconsin mac and cheese with the Parmesan chicken on the side with a side of the Thai chicken soup. It was fine. It wasn't anything special at the end of the day but it filled me up. To me, it was so-so there were no bold tastes or anything extravagant. 

I would be interested to try another type of pasta from here but if it rated the same, probably wouldn't be back. 

Interested to give it another shot in the future and will update my review then.",0
trn_2160,"My coworkers and I patronize this place regularly in a variety of capacities: 10$ take out lunch which includes a perfect portion of sushi, salad, and miso. Or for long, lazy sushi sit-downs when our bosses have effed off early on Fridays. Or for emergency giant Bowls of Udon when we are hungover. 

The 10$ lunch special is available as eat-in or take-out, but when you have time to sit down you are rewarded with a nicely paced parade of edamame, noodle soup, then miso, then salad, then your lunch, then oranges.

I've never had anything but tasty food here. My dining companions have never complained either. I guess there isn't enough salt on the edamame but my palette is shot. 

The menu is huge and there is absolutely something for everyone. It's pleasantly and reassuringly busy but even large groups can usually get a table (we try to do reservations when we are 5+.) The decor is very tidy and relaxing. They always ask if you want to split the bill and offer quick card payments at table, which is always appreciate when you are eating with coworkers and friends.

They let us call our orders in early too, if we like, making it a really great option for us.

Love it!",1
trn_2161,"One of the better buffets in Vegas. It gets pretty pricey though, but it's the Bellagio - no surprises there.

Food items that stood out:

- cream of mushroom soup
- lamb osso bucco with creamy polenta (BOMB!)
- seafood paella
- 4 cheese pasta (or was it 3? 5?)
- actually all their pastas
- pesto potato mash
- KING CRAB LEGS WITH BUTTER
- SHRIMP COCKTAIL
- panna cotta with strawberry puree (SO GOOD)

trn_2162,"I wish there was a Topgolf closer to Jersey. My aunt took me here on vacation for a day of fun. I really did not know what to expect because I am not a golfer at all, and I pretty much hate mini golf (horrible experience as a child). But I was her guest and happy to do whatever... I was just happy being in Arizona, in warm weather, and with my family. 

Prior to getting there, my aunt tried explaining what Topgolf was and I did not get it at all. She said it was bowling for golf at a range... still did not help. However, as soon as I got there it clicked and her explanation was really spot on (sorry aunt T, I thought you were crazy for a sec)! Topgolf is a 3 level outdoor golfing range with outside targets that scores your swings/balls (I apologize, I do not know the proper golf terminology yet). There is a screen (like bowling) you use to track your scores and compete. They have several different games, but we just played the rookie one since we were both new to the idea.

It was a blast and I am really glad I was open-minded and tried. It was a gorgeous day to golf with my aunt and enjoy some beers. Did I mention that have a full kitchen and bar?! Yea... it was pretty awesome. I could only imagine how fun this place would be at night with my friends....!",1
trn_2163,"I wanted to like this place but unfortunately it fell short and I would not recommend it.  I was pleased to see it open as it looked like it would be on the higher end  in terms of quality and decor.  Boca Park, in my opinion, could use a restaurant that is on the higher end. They have plenty of middle of the road options (like Cheesecake Factory or Kona Grill) but nothing one step up from that.  

To start off, when we first arrived I heard a saxophone player playing and I thought ""Oh cool, they must have a little live jazz band or something"".  I realized when I sat down that it was just a guy with a saxophone standing in a corner playing along randomly to the radio.  Inside they have plenty of room where they could put a 3 piece jazz band if thats what they were going for.  It came off as awkward and half assed to me to have one guy with a saxophone standing in a corner, playing random sax licks to songs on the radio.  Have a jazz band or don't have a jazz band, but ya can't do it halfway.  

I ordered the truffle fries and the filet mignon.  The truffle fries were OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  The filet mignon was very mediocre. It was no better than a steak you'd find at Cheesecake Factory.  From what I remember it was about $30.  For the same price (maybe $5 more) you can go to Echo & Rig in Tivoli Village right up the road and get a filet mignon that rivals the $70 filet mignon you might find at the higher end steakhouses on the strip.  My date ordered some chicken dish, which again was just OK.

Overall it was just a bit underwhelming.  For the two of us the bill was about $100.  For the same money I could go to Echo & Rig literally 1 minute away in Tivoli Village and get much better food/ambiance.  The Mixx seems like it is trying to be a more hip, slightly higher end restaurant, but in my mind they've just fallen short.  If a place is really great I don't mind spending a lot on dinner. In this case I left feeling like I shouldn't have spent $100 on dinner, and maybe should have gone to Kona Grill instead.",-1

Ordered the art of chicken. Picked up right as it was coming out of the oven. Ate a slice on my way home. Exactly how crust should be. Hot and perfectly crispy.  I don't think this particular pizza has sauce on it. Maybe olive oil? The lack of sauce made it very light. VERY LIGHT, almost bland.

trn_2169,"Last night we were served what I would have to call one of the most amazing, innovative, and delicious meals that I have ever experienced! The service was sublime! The food was unique and exciting! And the atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and enjoyable! We started with a monstrous platter of oyster shooters which my nephew declared as ""creamy and buttery"", LOBSTER & TRUFFLES
with basil shells, pasta cooked perfectly al dente with a hint of shaved truffle was to die for, a bowl of mussels in a broth that we were soaking up with a wonderfully crunchy grilled bread, and an andouille and blistered tomato flatbread perfect for those of us who needed something other than the shellfish! We then ordered a smorgasbord of delights including the GRILLED BANH MI SHRIMP, SALMON & TUNA POKE bowl that comes with sushi rice, pickled jalapeno, and greens. The fried CALAMARI with smoked aji aioli, pickled peaches, and herbs was perfectly cooked with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy sauce drizzled on the plate to drag through. The STUFFED QUAIL was stuffed with andouille bread pudding, shishito, foraged mushrooms which melted in your mouth. We doubled up on the SCALLOPS & LATKE as suggested by our very knowledgeable and extremely attentive waiter so that everyone in our party who wanted had their own portion. It was well worth it!  We enjoyed the 
HANGER STEAK served over creamed leeks, zucchini, and pickled red onion and the FRIED OYSTERS were a sweet surprise! Lightly breaded and golden brown, one bite full of flavor. The HARMONY RIDGE DUCK BREAST with smashed potatoes finished off our own selections, again perfectly cooked to a medium as asked, juicy and tender. 
As if that wasn't enough, our ever ready waiter suggested that we sample a newly created dish that he felt was often overlooked on a menu with so much to offer and a taste treat not to be missed! The GRILLED TUNA in a dashi broth, with eggplant, smoked tomatoes, fried parsnips. He was correct! It  was sushi grade tuna perfectly cooked and the dashi broth was full flavored and briny. The pop when you bit into the whole cherry tomatoes gave an acidity that balanced with the oils of the tuna and the crunch of the parsnips enhanced the texture of the dish. Hats off to the wonderful sous chef Kordecki, who we were told created this amazing combination! 
A mixed platter of yummy desserts and coffee sealed the deal that we will be coming back for many more adventurous and delicious meals here!",1
trn_2170,"My husband and I tried this place the other night for the first time, and the food was very good. It was a nice and quiet atmosphere, so we were able to sit and visit. Very enjoyable.

I guess they deliver, as well, and as new customers they gave us a coupon to use if we order a delivery. Overall, I really liked it. :)",1

I had to come back because me and my sister couldn't get done together because she brought her kid. I told them if i could get a balayage instead but, they turned my hair dark! instead of blonde.

My husband and I are vegan and finding places to eat without just ordering a salad and fries is very difficult. For our anniversary, he scouted out some Madison vegan/vegetarian-friendly places and this restaurant's menu compelled me to pick it for our date. Why else we loved Monty's:

-Plenty of parking available (in their own lot) in what I thought may be a crammed downtown area
-Delicious menu of breakfast served all day, sandwiches, and desserts (regular or veg/vegan friendly!!)
-friendly staff
-FAST service--we waited maybe 10 min for our food

-Reasonable prices (a dinner bill at $20?!)

I've never tried their fried rice, but their white rice (which is admittedly fairly hard to mess up) is always very good. The Won Ton Soup is also very tasty.

The portions (regular size) are large enough that I don't think I've ever managed to finish an entire dish there without having to share with somebody else.",1

My husband commented that you could cut it with your fork. Being a true southerner, I take great pride in my biscuits and gravy. Good news- so do they! Our plates were scraped clean to get that last bite if gravy- it would be a shame to waste. My toddler and 10 year old both loved their kids classic breakfast- eating every bite.

I had the carnitas with black beans and jerk fried rice while hubby had the jade red chicken quesadilla, jerk chicken, pork fried rice and black beans.

Most places are stingy on the seafood when it comes to seafood soon tofu, so I'm already not expecting much, but what I got was just ridiculous. I was basically eating just tofu and rice. Maybe it was just a bad night or a dish to avoid, but it would take a lot for me to come back and give them another chance.",-1
trn_2202,"Awesome BBQ takeout. Quick, a ton of food, service with a smile. We ALWAYS have left overs for a few days. We usually get 1 lbs of pulled pork a large Mac n cheese, Med. Coleslaw for my husband and I. A cheeseburger for my daughter. The pulled pork or chicken is great on a taco too.

My only suggestion would be to give more buns with the pound of meats. There are never enough... But that's how we discovered putting it on a Taco works too.

Not a fan of the fried Ochra but maybe That's because I'm not a Southerner? 

Anyway, keep up the good work! My family loves this place. So convenient and yummy.",1
trn_2203,"Food was pretty good. First time doing take out, horrible wait service. Wait was 45mins, as told, but waited an additional 30mins when I got there. It wasn't like there were a lot of people dinning in. There were more take out orders, and everyone had to wait additionally while we were there. Food finally  was ready, but there the garlic nann was a small single order, so I added 2 more. Was told it would be another 5min... it was like 10-15mins! How is there not just a ton of garlic nann under a warmer ready to go! Poor people in he restaurant were waiting forever for their food too. I don't think anyone was actually eating. Will not be dinning in or take or ever again with them!! Should have just gone to Blue Taj.",0

I ordered a Bento Box with Chicken Katsu, Kailua Pork and Pineapple Chicken. I added a can of soda for $9.47 plus tip. The Bento comes with rice and a side, so I chose macaroni salad this time. 

My lunch arrived in about 6 mins. The Kailua Pork was hot to the point of steamy. The Chickens were good, each with its own dipping sauce. 

There was plenty of food to fill up this big guy and I still couldn't finish it.  The chicken was virtually the same for both dishes, just different sauces. The pineapple sauce was so cold and sweet, it went ignored. 

Still the best Katsu around!",1

Great selection with lobster, crab legs, sushi, sashimi, teppanyaki grill, roast beef, peking duck and fridges filled with bottled drinks that you can grab yourself.

Lucky Thai has hands down the very best Chicken Satay I have ever had, very strongly recommended.

Their Pad Thai is also very nicely done. A lot of places don't seem to cook the noodles right. They are either too dry, or too floppy, or stuck together. These guys really seem to have it together. This was my first time eating here and I must say, Whitey is impressed.

trn_2231,"This place is very busy during lunch to dinner because of their awesome dimsum menu and their Chinese menu in general.

I love the atmosphere of the place. Very good for a starving group of family/friends. Wide variety of food choices and their presentation of the food is good too. Mouth watering looking dimsum.

Spacious place though you have to wait during peek hours. 

We also tried coming here 45 min before they closed and the food was still satisfying. Though I would have prefered if they still serve dimsum before they close. Sometimes I just have this late night dimsum cravings! 

The only downside here probably is the servers are sometimes hard to understand or I don't know if they understood me or not or vice versa. Though since they got the orders right- i guess it's just me! 

I'm also glad about their location here in Bedington! I don't have to go downtown to satisfy my dimsum cravings- though I still wish they serve dimsum late at night!",1

Granted, all I got was a breakfast sandwich on whole wheat bread, but it was delicious...one of the best ones I've had. We stopped here on the way to a show to get a fast, filling meal. The sandwich was bigger than I expected...twice the size of Starbucks' breakfast sandwich. It's in the food court so there's lots of seating!",1
trn_2233,"It took about 25-30 minutes of waiting in line during lunch hour but I can say the food was well worth it!

I ordered 1 lb of mixed brisket (fatty and lean), 1 lb of ribs, 1 pint beans, and 1 pint of potato salad for 2 people. This was wayyyy too much food for 2 people but we were expensing it as party of a company trip so I didn't feel bad about it :)

The highlights were definitely the ribs and the baked beans. They actually put some of the smoked meat into the beans so it has that smokey flavor. The ribs were so tender, I can't think of another place where i've had better ribs.

Also if you dine in, they have 3 bbq sauces at each table - original, mustardy carolina sauce, and a spicy bbq. The spicy wasn't spicy at all though. My favorites were the original and the carolina sauce.

The guys behind the counter are so incredibly friendly and talkative. I didn't expect that for a place that gets so much traffic and has to serve so many customers.",1

trn_2242,"My wife and I ate hear on New Year's Eve, as we just wanted something quick, and weren't interested in some expensive prix fixe menu other restaurants were offering.  If you follow triple D at all, you'll notice that the decor of this place has Guy written all over it.  It's not a huge place inside, but they also offer outdoor seating.  Since it was about 35 degrees outside, we weren't interested in that, despite having heat lamps.

The only knock I have against this place is that the menu is a bit limited.  There were several things that looked good to me, but my wife was struggling to find something.  I had the Bacon Mac and Cheese Burger, while my wife decided on a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.  Each sandwich comes with a variety of different fries, which is cool.  You get crinkle cut, shoestring, wedge, waffle, etc.  I thought that was a cool idea.  The portions here are enormous, so be sure to bring your appetite.  My wife and I could barely finish half of our meals.  I thought the food tasted really good, so I'd be willing to give this place another shot.  It might be best to spilt a meal between two people, since they're so large.  It's probably not the best place to bring kids, as it's loud and there's a lot of boozing going on.

All in all, I'm a fan of Guy, and I thought his restaurant in Vegas was good.  We got out of here for about $40-$50 for the two of us.  Give this place a shot if you're in Vegas, and sit out on the patio if it's nice outside.",1

The quality of the food was good, I ordered the Bogey. But, it did not have tomatoes on it. I only discovered this after I drove the 20 miles back down to Chandler. 

I was extremely disappointed. I called to let them know (it's all about word of mouth these days ) and the lady was quite helpful and assured me I'd get a cookie next time I come in. But I won't come in again. I just won't take time to babysit and quality check sandwiches after I get them from here. 'Ain't no one got time for that.'

Now, the waffles ARE very good, and there's nothing wrong with the service, but the main reason to go is to watch the show. Yes, this restaurant is actually an ongoing, live-streaming talk show. Don't worry, you don't have to participate if you don't want to, but if you have delusions of being interesting or entertaining, they'll hook you up.",1

He was very knowledgable and gave me good tips on styling my hair and caring for my digital perm.  He recommended proper products to use, but didn't try to push selling them from the salon. $160 for both the cut and perm, he also gave good local restaurant recommendations. The salon was clean and modern and there seemed to be a steady flow of customers for the time I was there.  I would definitely return.

trn_2258,"I'd like to have given this place 2.5 stars. Some very good elements and some very poor ones as well. We did their defused room.

First the good... With the use of a groupon the price was very reasonable. The room had decent decorations and good technology. Two of the clues were very smart and a lot of fun to solve.

The negatives... Other clues had no basis in logic. We spent 20 minutes trying to solve a single clue and when we were given the answer it was hard not to be really angry. I don't believe that many people if anyone would have jumped to the silly conclusion of how to get the correct answer. The person who ushered us into the room gave us information that was very misleading. Finally our room was right next to another, which is of course fine, but they had a large group just outside our room who were loud for almost 10 minutes of our time. They certainly should have been kept in the lobby area. Once in the room they were still very loud, but I imagine not much can be done about that.

Back to the positives, the employees asked us what we thought and seemed to care about our constructive criticism. It seems as though they're willing to make changes based on feedback.

Ultimately, I don't know if I'll go back again for a second try. They did enough well that I'm tempted, but enough wrong so I might not waste my time.",-1

I had minestrone soup, their panini with prosciutto, and a vanilla panna cotta for dessert.

The minestrone soup was satisfactory, nothing memorable. The panini however... WOW, I am normally a very quick eater but it took me about 45 minutes to finish the two portions that they gave me! It was very, very good. The panna cotta was also delicious

trn_2264,"Trish has been my nail tech for years, and I absolutely adore her- for more than just her skills! She's always been the best to have a funny chat with, but doesn't push talking when I'm feeling quiet, or answering emails on my phone. After hearing that she was leaving her previous salon, I moved my regular business over to Crystal Lash Lounge & Nail Bar along with her because when you find someone as good as Trish, you stick with them!

Crystal has nice amenities for a nail spa including coffee, hot tea, cold water and light snacks and the interior is cutely decorated. Prices are standard around Vegas. Color selection is good and if there's something specific you're looking for that they didn't have, Trish would be able to come up with a recommendation for you. I always trust her taste in colors/shapes, she's never lead me wrong which is saying a lot- because all of her clients have different styles. She completely tailors her suggestions to my taste which she's gotten to know over time, but is never pushy. She'll suggest a new color along the same kind of palette when I'm getting bored and it's always on point. She's up to date on trends, and has a way of remembering your previous styles/colors. 

Overall though, the best thing about Trish is how quick she is for the quality of her work. It never ceases to amaze me, and in a day and age where time is money, Trish is priceless. She gets a gel fill done in 30-45min, and she's gotten me in and out for a gel pedi and gel fill in just over an hour. Seriously incredible that she can do work that's so perfect within that time frame!

trn_2266,"RaviSoups is a downtown favourite lunch spot located on Adelaide west of Peter Street. 

My colleagues and I often head over to Ravi when in need of some major comfort food during lunch time.  As a great spot for take-out or dine-in, Ravi always seems to be the place to indulge for most of us in the Fashion and Entertainment districts.

Ravi gets his inspiration from native Sri Lanka. As previous  saucier and known ""soup master"" of Mildred Pierce, he decided to open up his own kitchen and enchant us with his creative and delicious soups and wraps. Inspired by exotic ingredients from beautiful Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia, Ravi has been able to wow the crowds of 9-5ers looking for a different and tasty lunch fix.

Although all of the featured wraps at RaviSoups are amazing, my absolute favourite is the Curried Lamb wrap.

This wrap has the most delicious and creative ingredients one can never find in any other wrap, anywhere! This unique flour creation comes with lamb, roasted yams (a.k.a sweet potatoes), baby spinach, mango pineapple salsa, edamame, lime chili and mint cilantro. That's Ravi's secret, innovation and creativity with flavour in mind!

That said, Ravi's famed reviews come from his hearty and yummy soups; hence the name RaviSoups.  The soups are something extraordinary and tasty. For those that are soup-averse, you will need to try Ravi before you say ""pass"". 

My choice for lunch usually starts with the Curried Apricot and Red Lentil Soup. A must have.

Though my belief is that Ravi does not disclose the full length of the spices and ingredients of the soups, he does provide a sneak peek at what seems to be the best possible combination for a hearty soup - red lentils, curry flavoured apricot (my guess is this is blended in the curry), cilantro and lime creme fraiche. And that's just a preview, your palette will be able to tell you more once you try it, trust me!

Since RaviSoups is still working on their website, I have not been able to include a link to it. However, one good piece of information I can share is that Ravi has another location on Queen Street West close to the Drake Hotel.

trn_2268,"The more time I spend at Molly's, the more I like it... the best time to experience Molly's is during non-peak hours (in other words, not on a Friday or Saturday night). That's when I really like the vibe.

There are a couple of rooms near the back that make for a nice space for bigger groups, one in particular if you're hosting a larger group with some appys, there's a counter along the wall that makes for a nice ""serve yourself"" station. Otherwise, there's a nice big table that accommodates a group of 8-12 people quite nicely.

My favourite little nook has got to be the two big chairs by the fireplace behind the door. Head in later at night on a weekday and sip some tea or coffee to catch up with an old friend. It's like your own little world.",1
trn_2269,Today is co-workers 5 years anniversary and my company decided it wanted to get him an ice cream cake. EVERY single cake in the display case was damaged. I picked the one that had the least bit frosting on the package and when I opened it...the state of the cake was even worse. $21 dollars these people charge for what looks like a toddler decorated it.  Your store Baker should be ashamed of themselves for putting such garbage out there for the public to buy. Since this was a last minute buy I really had no choice but to purchase. I have officially learned from my mistake.,-1
trn_2270,"Horrible horrible experience!! 
Most of the merchandise they sell are returns they buy in lot quarantines from retailers 
And the vehicles, well let's just say if you buy a car and the engine falls out on the way out of the parking lot Ohh well You bought it.
So remember when you bid on a car that you can't test drive!! 
It might start and maybe even sound good but you never know.
Also check the positive reviews and the people who post them Funny.",-1
trn_2271,"im not a brushetta fan but i tried it here cause someone else order it. I must say the Antipasto app was excellent with their creamy garlic spread i also like the herbs they used. im pretty sure it was basil and lots of olive oil. Sometimes i find places overload on tomato and that's all you can taste but this dish had a good blend to it. The large toasted slice bread was a good touch. 

Also had the antipasto mix platter with a variety of cheese, deli meats, bread, olives, figs, and sundried tomoatoes. A nice sharing dish for the patio to go along with some pints. 

The service was very good considering it was a packed patio on a thursday night. waiter was prompt and was never left hanging without a beer.

overall a really good experience",1
trn_2272,"This is truly a beautiful little area.

Other reviews have noted that it's a ghost town during the week (which I can attest to this being true), but with the casino supposedly re-opening next February, that may change later.  I think reviews have been a little too hard on the lack of people.  Besides, who wants to be crowded all the time?

It's about as ""Non-Vegas"" as you can get.  Why is this important or even wanted?  Sometimes you need a break from the oranges and browns of the desert, and be around a body of water.  The style of the whole place looks like an Italian village.  It's startling when you walk through it and realize you haven't driven all that far to be here.

On weekends (for now, anyway), they run movies in the part and have music playing.  This place earns a whole star simply because you can walk barefoot in the grass (You don't realize how much you miss the sensation until it's rare).  The shops and restaurants are pleasant and low-key.  There's even a great Irish pub in the area.  The surrounding area is remarkably quiet.  I'd go as far as to say it's quaint.  I am going to have to break down and rent a paddleboat.

While it isn't a jam-packed full area full of 24/7 party central, there are plenty of places in Vegas to get that atmosphere.  If you want something quiet and intimate (great for dating), this is perfect for just going out for a stroll and making the night your own.",1
trn_2273,Wow what a improvement! Have been back twice (first time back was good) second time very good! Food fast to be ready! Taste excellent quality excellent! Counter people pleasant! I was so happy to have one if my favorite places back on good side of quality!,1
trn_2274,Glad we found this place. The gelato is awesome. They have a large selection of flavors all made there and let you sample before deciding on one. Friendly knowledgeable  staff  as well.,1
trn_2275,Dr Nakhle is great but unfortunately the wait time to see him is hours . I have been a patient for over 6 years and there is never a time that I don't wait over an hour to get into a room. I am a busy professional so I try to take the first appointment of the day and still wait hours. How can you be this late for the first appointment of the day unless you just don't care. I would recommend another facility because the 5 minute doctor visit is not worth hours of your day.,-1
trn_2276,"Stores that buy jewelry sometimes have a bit of a shady feel to them. I was very surprised to encounter an engaging and professional owner who gave me what appears to be sound advice on selling my ring. Aaron, as he introduced himself, advised me both on what he could offer AND alternatives to his store that could be in my best interest. I thought that was very stand-up and I appreciated his input.
Additionally, when another customer came in offering to sell a squirrel, Aaron refused, which shows he is humane.
I would definitely recommend this store to the first time jewelry seller who would like an easy and pleasant experience.",1
trn_2277,"This is a little gem on east Madison. Thanks to Yelp's Boozing and Schmoozing event, I got to learn about Old Sugar Distillery on my first trip here. It's awesome to know that they source locally as much as possible and do the brewing and distillation themselves. 

Their drinks are awesome! I had the honey cap -- made with their very own honey liquer. As mentioned on their menu, this drink is so delicious, it goes down very easily and you won't feel that you are having an alcoholic drink until moments later, which is not a bad thing =) 

Snacks wise, they serve Banzo pita and hummus, which complement your drinks nicely. 

Even though I came as a group in an organized event, you don't have to do that in order to get a 'tour' of the place. The people there are very nice and friendly and more than happy to explain you how things work and show you around. 

The outdoor patio is a plus. Sipping drinks out in the sun and enjoying the weather outside. Love my first experience and I will be back when I am in the Eastside again.",1
trn_2278,"Excellent location. They do a free body-fat composition with specific details. It's hands-down legit! They also offer protein supplements without sugar, which is ideal. Additionally, the store is super clean and the service is top-notch. If you ask a question, they will answer it in a friendly way. There are no attitudes here at all. Highly recommended.",1
trn_2279,"My partner and I have been here twice, and each time the food and service has been spot on! Be sure to ask for a seat outside to enjoy a great view of the strip with your meal, and hope that you get Eddie as your server :-) Oh, and if you're thinking of getting the al carbon steak nachos be prepares to share, they're pretty sizeable!",1
trn_2280,"This little local Italian Deli and Grocery store is awesome! We stopped in for some authentic Italian groceries. They have a wide variety of imported pastas, sauces, cookies, olive oils, vinegars and other oils. Cheeses and meats. We walked out with ingredients to make a super yummy lasagna. The deli here is stocked with pasta salads, sandwiches, and other Italian delicacies. The service here is top notch.
Tony was there when we were there, and my husband(who is half Italian) and Tony traded lasagna recipes. We will be back!",1
trn_2281,They say they are open until 7pm.  It's is 615pm and the guy inside says they are closed.   Won't be wasting my gas to come here again.  THEY CLOSE EARLY!,-1

trn_2283,Loud and tendu but I have had better sushi.  Not the best place but overall not too bad. I rate it 3 out if 5 stars.,0
trn_2284,Matt came out to check the vents at my rental property. He was very thorough and very honest! He looked it over and tested the vents and informed me that everything was clean and didn't need any service. I appreciated his honesty and will recommend him for future jobs. You will be happy you hired him!,1
trn_2285,"The food game has been stronger than ever in Vegas and one of the establishments leading the charge is Yardbird. Their southern cooking is so on point it's ridiculous. 

Ambiance is chill, service is attentive, and creativity + execution of food was spot on. 

What to get:
- Deviled eggs: comes with dill, chives and caviar on top (best deviled eggs I've had and I hate dill!)

- Fried chicken /or fried chicken and watermelon waffles: I don't care which you get as long as you do the right thing and go with what they're known for. These juicy chicken parts are brined for 27 hours before being thrown into the deep fryer. The hot sauce it comes with is also so perfect and exactly what a hot sauce should be. It's not not spicy, not too spicy but has a significant kick that doesn't overpower the star of the show. #divine

- Fried green tomatoes: yes lawd! So bomb.. Crunch of the fried exterior with the overflowing juice of the tomato with each bite. To top it off it has pork belly, some cheesy mixture and frisée to make you feel you're consuming healthy greens :) 

- Bbq brisket sandwich: got this because they didn't serve the ribs at lunch (boo!) but was craving some bbq sauce. Overall it was solid but I feel the chicken is the better way to go if debating between the two. 

Love you yardbird. Even though I used two meal slots during my Vegas trip on you, I still can't wait to come back. Gratzie!",1
trn_2286,"When we walked in, it was pretty slow.  
But the burgers were great.  The staff was attentive and the milkshakes were tasty.  The mushroom cheeseburger came with fresh onion and lettuce. The French fries were done to perfection, and the food came out fast.  My wife had the meatball soup, and it was so large my daughter and her shared it.
Pricing was extremely reasonable.
Definitely worth returning!",1
trn_2287,This place has terrible customer service. Don't go there expecting to watch an out of town team like the SF Giants. It's the Diamondbacks on all the TV's ( of which they have many). The will not change at customer request.,-1
trn_2288,"I love going here for the view!  We ordered calamari to start.  You get a large portion but they were a bit greasy.  I ordered the Seafood Pescattore and it was delicious and very filling.  The other dishes were good too Salmon Florentine and Seafood Ravioli. The Apple Taffy Cheesecake was fantastic.   UnfortunateIy, my sister got food poisoning from the Ravioli.  I called the restaurant to inform them and was surprised by the way it was addressed. I got a sorry and that's it.  I would of liked if the offer to reimburse her meal or something was offered but nothing.  I know her first experience wasn't good so she won't be returning.  Unfortunately I took her there on her birthday!  I'll go back because I've never had a problem in the last 3 years of going and enjoy the view and food!",1
trn_2289,"I don't have any experience shopping in the store, but I was able to return a dress here that I had rented via their website and it was a quick, convenient, and painless experience. Great location in the Cosmopolitan, Vegas is definitely the perfect spot for a RTR brick and mortar.",1
trn_2290,"Really busy place on a Saturday night...glad we made a reservation but the line seemed short anyway.  the food was ok.  I had the special which was a rib-eye in a Marsala wine sauce, mash potatoes and some squash.  waitress was nice but over worked  and little time at the table, but our glasses never ran dry.  the white wine would have been better if it was chilled and the lighting was dim.  really would have rated 3.5 given the chance.",0
trn_2291,Went in for my first microdermabrasion treatment. Elizabeth was my aesthetician and did a wonderful job walking me through the treatment and gave some fabulous tips on how I can take care of my skin using natural ingredients and not pushing any particular brand. Treatment lasted for about 20-30 minutes long. I felt very relaxed and rejuvenated after! Highly recommended!,1
trn_2292,"Not having played in a very long time I really enjoyed shooting some pool here.   Felt was in great condition, the rails were firm and the rate very reasonable.    Corners aren't that forgiving, so make your shots count",1

trn_2295,Ordered take out from the yelp app and added special instructions (no onion AND no Peppers) but our pizza came with BOTH! We sadly didn't check it before leaving the store and we had to pick out all the onions & peppers while sitting in the bed of our pick up watching the fireworks. Very disappointed this type of thing was missed.,-1
trn_2296,Just had my first visit with Lisa today. I LOVEEEEEE my hair. She is truly talented. She is so sweet and truly listens to what you want. I'm so glad I met her. I had been going to the same person for the last 10 years but she moved far so I have tried a few places before meeting Lisa. This is my first review since trying other salons. I'm pretty picky with my hair but Lisa did an amazing job. So glad I found her. Thank you Lisa!!,1
trn_2297,"Not a good taco place at all. Just too leaky. Chips and salsa are not free. Limited selection of beer. I'd rather go to Cien Agaves in Scottsdale - free chips and salsa, plus the most amazing tacos!!!",-1
trn_2298,"I stumbled across this restaurant several years ago after becoming frustrated with the generally 2 hour wait, (no matter what day) at a DIFFERENT pizza restaurant in Heritage square, downtown Phoenix.  Although the pizza was terrific at that ""other"" restaurant in Heritage square, I had a pretty UNBELIEVABLE experience....I was with a date, we waited the 2+ hours, had a really good dinner, salad, an appetizer and pizza.  We decided we wanted another pizza and when we asked our server for another, we were told that we could not because there was a line of people waiting to get in.  I was amazed.  We left knowing we would NEVER go back.  I heard about La Piazza al Forno not long after that experience.....I truly believe things happen for a reason.  The pizza was even better and has been consistant ever since.  The service was very warm and friendly, literally like a family welcoming me into their home.  I learned that night, that it was one big family run business.  Oh and by the way, the best...did I say BEST pizza that I not only have had in AZ, but NY has nothing over them!  Icing on the cake, the prices are VERY reasonable! I GOTTA have a fix every 10 days! For the longest time I didn't want to tell anyone about my secret, however, they DESERVE to be known!  AWESOME!!!",1
trn_2299,"Excellent!
Being new to Las Vegas I never thought a 'hail-storm' could cause so much damage.  My son's 96 black Honda resembled the texture of a golf ball!  Plus, Ewing Bros took care of the additional markings our insurance agent made in circling each of those indents!
The Honda is truly a Showroom Beauty!  I'm recommending Ewing Bros Body Shop for the quality of their work, their experience, and for the pride in their work that continues to shine!",1
trn_2300,"The service was amazing. However, I would expect to have a $40 steak cooked correctly. I asked for it to be medium and received a very well done steak. I had to be somewhere and was on a time schedule so bad to eat the $40 piece of leather. Also not sure that the health department is ok for people preparing food to have their long un groomed beard without a hair net. Glad I didn't get hair in my food.",0
trn_2301,"Went here for dinner tonight with a craving for their fish tacos.  When the food arrived, there was only 2 tacos and maybe 7 broken yellow tortilla chips.  In the past this dish came with 3 fish tacos and half a plate of tri colored tortilla chips.  My fiancee got the Ahi salad and there was maybe 6 small pieces of tuna.  In the past, there was easily 3 times the tuna, and it was placed around the entire outer edge of the plate.  The price for each item was higher than in the past.  

Beware of shrinking portions and high prices here.",-1
trn_2302,"Horrible. The water we got was clearly unfiltered tap water. The gyro was cold, my daughter's fried fish was still frozen inside. We gave it back and they brought the same cut apart piece back after frying it again. Of course it was overcooked, dry and hard now. The chicken soup was sour from too much vinegar (who puts vinegar in chicken soup anyways?). 
Eventually they counted my son, who is less than a year old and only eats his baby food as the sixth guest and therefore added 18% gratuity to the check for this bad service.
Never again.",-1
trn_2303,"I found Terry and Kathy on Yelp.com and couldn't be more satisfied. This family owned business is top notch and I agree with Nick B., every other business could learn from them. I have taken in my truck and my husband has taken his car. We are very pleased with the work, straight forward honest and the customer service is outstanding. We will continue to use the Max Auto team and we will spread the good word...... Thank you Max Team!",1
trn_2304,I was in from out of town and paid $150 to get eyelash extensions done. It is now two days later and my left eye is already looking much more sparse then my right and extensions are already falling out. I live in another state so can't even go back for them to fix them. Not happy with how much I spent on this,-1
trn_2305,Today was their grand opening..so impressed with how fresh the sandwiches tasted and how friendly the staff were. The prices are also very affordable which is a plus... 10 in sandwich for 4.50! We will be back considering its right down the road from us.,1
trn_2306,"Generally I wouldn't trust a place that advertises dim sum as ""Chinese tapas"",  but we had a Groupon and gave it a shot. 

A bit pricer than Chinatown with the average dim sum dish ranging between $4-7. We ordered the sui mai, pork dumplings,  taro dumplings which were made well. They weren't greasy or overly slimy like the bigger, more busy Chinatown restaurants and each piece was significant, almost like made to order. I don't think the dumplings were frozen,  and if they are then they are pretty high quality. 

This isn't a bad place to eat if you catching a show across the street but since the prices are almost double than what you pay in Chinatown,  I might just stick Rosewood for my dim sum fix.",1
trn_2307,"My girlfriend and I love this place. The building is so old and seedy looking on the outside but honestly once you come in it's a super comfortable fun atmosphere. I have never had a problem playing in a game or playing doubles if all the pool tables are full and every other customer I've met is super friendly. The wings are the biggest around and it's not very close AND they're not breaded at all, I don't know where they get them from but they're big and delicious. It's either those or the fire burger every time I come in, because that comes with french fries and their french frys are A++ as well. Crystal, Casey, and Leslie are the sweetest bartenders in town and we always try to come in to see them once a week, and Ari is Tempe's ambassador to Europe so if you like to travel he's the one to talk to. If ever we go out, we end up back at Groggy's and it's always a great time.",1
trn_2308,"Was just in a couple days ago, so not only is this location open but it has to be one of the best Popeyes I've ever been too! The dining room was exceptionally clean, fantastic customer service, and the food was so fresh!!! This location is worth the trip!!!",1
trn_2309,"Overall I found this brewery to be average. Didn't love it but didn't hate it either. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back.

My husband and I visited this brewery and Noda brewery right across the street on a recent visit to Charlotte. I really liked the layout of the place with the large, covered patio. The inside part of the place was cozy and comfortable. Service at the bar was fine and not very memorable.

I ordered the Lazy Bird Brown. It was okay but not my favorite brown. My husband ordered the flight and tried the wheat, Saison, pale ale and IPA. He liked the IPA the most. 

I like their theme and logo and I especially liked the large barrel of self-serve peanuts by the front door. That was a nice touch! Prices are around $4 for a pint, so definitely pretty reasonable.",0
trn_2310,As I mentioned on my review for a different Sammys location the Mac & Cheese is a must get when you are here.  In fact you should get it if you are just driving by.  try it and let me know what you think.,1
trn_2311,This place is fantastic. It was a really unexpected treat while In Las Vegas.  Great atmosphere and the food was perfect! Open late. My husband and I loved it and will def come back!,1
trn_2312,This place was terrible. The food was cold and the variety you would expect for a buffet was mediocre. Even the dessert station was seriously lacking. For 38 dollars a person I could have had a way better meal somewhere else. Save your money and go somewhere else.,-1
trn_2313,"Not worth it at all! Bellagio is one of the nicer hotels/casinos on the strip so we expected much more, especially with the price they charge. Food was mediocre. Many selections flavorless and the display was very confusing. But before we could even get into the buffet, there was a situation we witnessed that completely ruined our mood. The line for non members was very long, normal considering it was Labor Day weekend. We had a member in our group but his status wasn't high enough so we waited in the non members line with all the other honest people. When we finally reached the front, these two women in the members line next to us were told that their status was not high enough for that line. The ladies did not seem shocked at all, which tells me they do this often. They asked the worker to be let in just this once, and our surprise, the worker agreed! Completely unfair for the rest of the good people waiting. They should've been told to get in the back of the non members line, along with everyone else who waited. Children, families, older adults, all hungry and patiently waiting. Yet they allowed these two women to be let in and cut everyone else. We decided not to say anything since we didn't want to cause a scene and they were behind us anyway. But then we were smacked with another annoying surprise. They were actually called in and seated before us, all because we had a stroller and they didn't. Unfair system, flavorless food, high price. We want our hard earned money back!",-1
trn_2314,"Wow.  Some of, if not the best, sushi in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  And when you throw in the reasonable prices, far and away the best value.  Be prepared, the portions are about 20-30% larger than you get at other sushi restaurants.  Have been there dozens of times.  The only problem is that it is a small restaurant, so there can be a wait during peak meal times, even during the week.",1
trn_2315,"Nothing about this bar excites me. They had a nice B.J lounge over by the MGM grand but the lame Dotty's brought out the building. I wish the bar would do somethimg unique to get the blood boiling for a change. Karoke, trivia night, bingo or something. Shit, adding a Touch Tunes machine would help enormously. What happened to the female bartender's skimpy outfits? Come on man. EXCITE ME!!!!!",-1
trn_2316,I've tried sushi here a few times and both times I really enjoyed them. I tried dragon with salmon as well as with eel and also Philadelphia. The services was very attentive. The rolls were quite big and 8 pieces were enough for me to feel full. I will definitely come back.,1
trn_2317,"The worst Thai Express I've tasted in Canada. And the worst chicken noodle soup I've tasted in my life. Absolutely no taste at all. And the girl at the cashier has terrible attitude. No expression on her face. No willing to open her mouth to talk to customers. It seems that the whole world owes her something. When I asked her for a soup spoon for my noodle soup, she's like I owe her big! And I had to leave the noodle soup with just one sip because it tastes so bad. And no vegetable leaves at all.",-1
trn_2318,"Great spot for a nice dinner date! Everything was super fresh and tasty, their staff is amazing and really nice. We arrived early (around 6pm) and we got a table right away but by the time we left there was a pretty lineup (they do take reservations!!) 

We had their ayce and paid around $80 (dinner for two and three beers). My bf and I always fill up on sushi really fast so I don't think we got our money's worth of food, next time we'll order from the menu.",1

trn_2320,"This is the third time my boyfriend and I have been here for dinner. It's close to our place and the food is really good. We normally get the Butter Chicken and the Saag Paneer and mix it up with the other two-- maybe take some home or eat it all-- just depends.

On this occasion, we noticed they had a buffet. I'm not a huge fan of the Indian buffet unless the place does major traffic and even then, it's dicey. Not that I worry about germs, but I find the food to be of supreme low quality-- almost everywhere. We opted for the menu, with the addition of the Lamb Rogan Johst and what I would normally call Bhartha (Eggplant curry) But it was served as whole baby eggplants in a rich spicy tomato gravy. OOhhh... this one was soooo good! The others were delicious,too and almost always are. 

In addition to the fine noshes, I also love that they have a cheap Chilean Sav Blanc that is totally quaffable with spicy stuff for $7 a glass $24 a bottle. Prices for the mains are reasonable here, too. The most expensive curry was our Butter Chicken at $12. Good Times.

Service was fabulous. Two different servers looked after us and we always had lots of water and more importantly-- another glass of wine! Nothing that wasn't full was ever left on the table.

While the food and service here are both of exceptional quality, I find the ambiance to be lacking. No real decor to speak of and the menus were dirty. The bathrooms were also not super clean. The toilet I visited had a large dirty footprint on the seat. I took one point off for these things. Otherwise, Apalla is pretty great! We took a delivery menu on our way out just in case I am too lazy to make Butter Chicken at home and don't want to clean the toilet.",1
trn_2321,"This gym is run down. It really feels like the owners have not put a dime in the facility since it has opened. And quite frankly, they don't do a very good job at keeping it clean. The sound system does not even work. It cuts in and out like a broken record. When I brought this to their attention they said they know they have a wiring issue. Then I brought to their attention that half of the paper towel dispensers in the gym don't have any paper towels. The response that I got was that the cleaning crew does not come in during the weekend. So I guess they don't care about gym patrons not wiping down the equipment after they use them during the weekend? I guess infectious bacteria doesn't spread on weekends?  The only thing that does gym has going for it is that it is cheap. But I guess you get what you pay for. It's a shame, this gym is in such a convenient location. Management needs to step it up.",-1
trn_2322,"I have used the mailbox services many times for faxes, shipping and passport quality pictures and have been pleased with the pricing and customer service. They also have an excellent jeweler in Marvin the Goldmaster. I commissioned a large custom ring. Marvin listened to what I wanted and designed a beautiful original ring that surpassed my expectations. Every step of the way he checked in with me to make sure he captured my idea and translated it into a physical piece of custom jewelry. I could not be happier and the price was so much cheaper than the larger jewlers quoted.

trn_2323,"I love the Pickled Peach! The food is all farm to table, and there is actually a chalkboard that tells you which farm produced each ingredient in every option. I highly recommend the ham/brie/pickled peach sandwich. It's goey and has the savory sweet complex flavor that makes you wish you could rewind time and eat it again when you've finished. Their homemade soups and salads are always delicious, and they offer vegetarian and gluten free options. Located in Davidson, it's a quaint lunch spot with a big flavor punch.",1
trn_2324,Was wanting an ice cream place that didn't serve soft serve and wasn't a chain.  I Googled 'the best ice cream places'  in Arizona and Mighty Moo came up and saw all the positive reviews.  I took my boyfriend there and we were amazed with all the flavors they had to offer and how damn good the flavors tasted.  I ended up telling two of my other friends about it and we went again the next day.  The banana cream pie and sweet corn raspberry swirl are delicious!  Would recommend this place for sure if you're looking for a unique ice cream joint.,1
trn_2325,"Place was a little hard to find but after using Google maps I found it. The set up is kind of like it was built in what used to be a home. I've never seen anything like that but it's GENIUS. I felt like I was in my moms kitchen waiting for breakfast. I ordered a chorizo omelet with potatoes and sourdough bread. Sooooo good, they gave me way too much food but who's to complain? Servers were not too pushy or over bearing (something I hate) I'm coming back In a few days to bring my mom. So good and would highly recommend",1
trn_2326,My favorite sandwich shop period.,1
trn_2327,"Horrible service! We waited 40 minutes for a table, 20 minutes for service, 30 minutes for an iced tea and another hour for food. Then I had to ask twice for an iced tea refiill. I will not be returning and wouldn't have put my name on this restaurant if I was a celebrity chef.
I almost forgot to review the food. The chicken wings were over cooked and the quad fries tasted all the same just cut differently. I think it was seasoning salt used heavily on all of the fries. The burgers were OK but not memorable.",-1

The only way we as a community are going to end the over-population of these breeds is to spay/neuter and be responsible.  It is not the dogs and cats' fault that they end up at county.   There is also a third facility that has dogs and cats under county and it is at the Petsmart in Scottsdale at Camelback Road and Miller.  It is a smaller facility in the back of Petsmart.  I will always support these facilities because I know I am directly saving an animal and making room for the 100 plus dogs and cats that daily enter these facilities.  If you don't like the facility for the hour or two that you are there saving an animal, thing about the animal sitting there for days.  It's worth the visit.   Thanks for listening.",1

Looks like they were getting ready to go home because they were cleaning up and making drinks at the same time.  I've never had problems till today.  I get in my car and drive off. Later when the ""hot chocolate"" has cooled off a bit, I take a sip and guess what. It's hot milk.  Im sure every drink has a guideline of how much ingredients is to be put in.

trn_2334,"I've got a bit of a love-hate relationship with this Sobey's. On the one hand, it's the only substantial grocery store within walking distance to me, and it has a pretty good selection even though it's not huge. On the other, it can be very overpriced at times ($2 for frozen orange juice!), but there are just enough good loss-leader sales to keep me coming back, grudgingly.

It's supposedly open 24 hours, but I just discovered that that doesn't include holidays (in the middle of last night, of course). That strikes me as pretty stupid, since you'd think that the most likely night the average person would want to buy a frozen pizza at four in the morning would be before his day off, when nothing else would be open.",0
trn_2335,"Let me start by saying that I love Cafe Hollander's food and have never had problems with it at any location. I've also never had a problem with service at any Milwaukee location, but the Madison location must still be figuring things out. I've been there three times. The first time, the waiter either was no where to be found for a long time, or lingered by the table giving obnoxious recommendations when all I wanted to do was be able to read the menu. But then the second time I went there I sat at the bar with friends and the bartender serving us was super weird. At one point he started starring at one of my friends and it was obvious, so she looked back at him. He then seemed to get offended and said loudly ""what?!"". She said nothing and looked away and he asked why she was looking at him. 
About a half hour later we asked for the bill and asked for separate checks. He said he didn't think they did separate checks (umm wtf are you even talking about), and then some other bartender came over to correct him. Then he walked over to us like we were going to pay, but hadn't given us a bill yet! My friend asked if he could tell us how much we each owed before he took our cards and he said ""sure let me go check"". I hope this guy isn't as weird to everyone else as he was to us!


Update: pretty sure my boyfriend and I both got food poisoning from the fish fry last night which is really disappointing because their fish fry actually tastes amazing. But being in the bathroom the rest of the night was not.

Update 2: I think I'm done with this cafe Hollander. Every time I go at least one thing is disappointing. Check out the picture of my drink, taken before I had any of it. Also, ice chunks in a martini. No thanks. Surprising that this drink made it past both the shitty bartender that made it and the waitress who brought it to me without anyone catching how bad it was.",-1

It sometimes takes 40 minutes to get a salad, which is weird, because they are only open for lunch. So, it's a great place to take vegan friends when you're in no rush and just socializing. It's a terrible place to go when you only have an hour for lunch.

Also, I seriously love vegan food, which is often complex, flavorful, and well-spiced. This.... isn't. Not even a little. For these prices, I'd rather hit up Lai Lai Wok, or another traditional Chinese place on campus, and get a much bigger portion of stir-fried veggies and rice. 

I appreciate their cruelty-free food message, and I'm probably their target audience, since I love vegan food... but I wish the taste justified the price tag.",-1

We went the Saturday before and it was excellent and then we went back on Xmas and it was horrible. The previous Xmas the same thing.

Xmas 2011 I waited in line for 4 hours, past the 3:00 cut-off for champagne but just in time for the higher dinner price and lousy food. And no one said at the end of the line the expected wait time.

trn_2343,"So, out of finals desperation, I needed some high-sodium comfort food. Unfortunately, Rice Garden, my preferred purveyor of fried goodness was closed, so I settled for a bacon cheeseburger and cajun fries at Crepe de Licious. That was actually pretty good, and the shoestring fries really hit the spot. 

That being said, the word ""Crepe"" is the main attraction and prior to my pretty good cheeseburger, I had an absolutely awful crepe experience. I had the Popeye crepe which according to the menu, had ""spinach, tomato, mozzarella, feta cheese & feta dressing"". In reality it was a tossing of spinach, 2 slices of tomato, a mushy crepe wrap, and some unpalatable goop that stopped me from finishing it.

The 'chef' who made my crepe that day must've had no sense of balance or taste, I wonder if they ever think about how that stuff tastes. Have some pride in your work, folks. Luckily, it's very hard to screw up a burger and fries, so if you are going to Crepe de Licious, avoid the crepes.",-1

trn_2346,"Dandelion Market was around the corner from the condo I was staying in for the week. Actually, there were several amazing places within the surrounding block and it was difficult to choose where to go. I took a seat at the bar, but quickly made the decision to move to a table as this wasn't the most friendly dining bar. I'm sure on a normal night, it would be just fine, but there seemed to be a couple large holiday parties going on while I was there as well. 

It was truly difficult to choose what I wanted to order; everything looked so tempting. But being a solo diner, I didn't want to over order in any way. Definitely will come back here with a dining buddy or two and explore a lot more of the menu. For this evening's adventure I went with the Southern Caprese and the Mustard Ale Sliders. For my beverage, I chose the Winter Fashioned. 

The Winter (Old) Fashioned was delicious and well-balanced. It wasn't too bitter, but just the right amount of sweet to make a nice finish on the palate. My caprese arrived first: fried green tomatoes, fresh mozz & a fig basalmic. It was hard not to pick it up with my hands and shove it in my mouth. I did the polite thing & took small bites. I would have licked the plate too if I wouldn't have garnered stares from my dining neighbors. The sliders came out quickly after they were ordered & I dove right in. They were cooked perfectly and the 'extras' didn't impede on the experience. The cheese & bacon were in perfect proportion and you got a little bit with each little bite.

While dessert was tempting, I was sated, so I called it a night and rolled myself home.",1
trn_2347,"ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!
My wife ordered a dining room set on Amazon from this company for $1,200.00 and the table was damaged when received.  We contacted Amazon regarding the damaged product and they contacted the seller for us.  The response was fast and they asked us for pictures of the damaged product, also asking if the receipt noted that the product was damaged or not.  We sent the pics they requested and pics of the box the table was in.  The box was in perfect condition so when the table was delivered I had no reason to open the box and check the table out.  Therefore, the receipt did not list a damaged product.  Furniture Creations solution was to offer us a 15% refund.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  We asked them what good is 15% and stuck with a damaged table.  We told them we loved the chairs and still wanted their product.  We just wanted a replacement table.  Then their response was giving us 20% refund.  AGAIN, ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  They told us without the receipt noting a damaged product they could not pinpoint where the damaged occurred and per their policy they could not replace the table.  IF THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED AND NOTED ON THE RECEIPT I WOULD HAVE TOLD THE DRIVER TO LOAD IT BACK UP AND SEND IT BACK!!!!! WHY WOULD I SIGN FOR A DAMAGED PRODUCT!!!!  Amazon has been monitoring our emails with Furniture creations and have now submitted a claim on our behalf.  Amazon told us that if Furniture Creations does not resolve the issue then Amazon will refund us our money and will remove Furniture Creations from being a seller on Amazon.

My chicken seemed to be slightly overcooked, and the advertised katsu sauce was not the type to which I am accustomed.  That being said. It was still tasty.  The fries were excellent, well cooked and seasoned.

So, why 4* when my sandwich was just good, not great?  Well, several things.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The decor was very cool.

I asked around, and EWC came recommended by friends, so I decided to try it out; plus the location was not even 5 minutes away from my house.

I even received a thank you note in the mail from her (handwritten) thanking me for coming in and wanting to see me again in 4 weeks. 

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the somewhat pushy sales.

This is probably one of the few places where I will have to disagree with many of the Yelp elites.

I decided to try Pho Tien because the reviews made it seem like it's a great place, and I didn't want to go too far west of Yonge. We were seated immediately at around 9pm on a Friday, and were served tea afterwards as well.

I ordered the crab meat and shrimps with udon noodle in thick soup, while my friend ordered the rare beef and brisket noodle soup. The translation for my order was banh canh cua tom, which means I expected they would use the vietnamese udon. Unfortunately they used the regular cheap udon you can get at your local Asian grocery store. The broth was also extremely oily and did not have the ""thick"" texture I expected. My friend's noodle soup lacked pieces of beef, and he found the broth to be on the bland side.

We also ordered iced lemonade, however the waitress forgot our order initially. They fixed it up and we got our iced lemonades, and I found it to be good, but nothing spectacular.

Service, however, was excellent, and the employees did apologize to us for our missed iced lemonade order. However, the poor food quality did not make up for it, and I will likely not return here.",-1

The icing on the red velvet was good, and it tasted homemade. That could be good or bad if you're like me and could have made that at home and wanted something more from a bakery. The vanilla cake tasted like a pretty good from scratch recipe, which again depends on what you're looking for. The chocolate cake was under mixed and had little white clumps in it, and had a crunch on it that we determined to be caused by over baking. Over all, my favorite part was the cream cheese/ powdered sugar frosting. But I don't think I'll go back again, because it's just underwhelming.",-1

Mimosas - on Sundays, bottles of champagne are $10.  Order a bottle and a glass of oj and mix your own :)

Sangarita - they have a not so amazing margarita on tap...mix it with the red sangria though and it is great.

Prosciutto and fried goat cheese salad - This is so good, I have started making my own copy cat version to take to work for lunch everyday (minus the fried part.)

Since I am usually dining alone, I almost always sit at the bar.  The bartenders and servers are friendly and fun to talk to.  The owner and managers greet me by name (ok, maybe I come here a bit too often.)

The food was horrible the burger was overcooked they seemed understaffed the fish and chips was OK but the problem was there was a long wait for ""all you can eat"" the menu was nothing like it used to be the live band was to loud for a bar so small some of the staff was rude and inattentive we used to come quite often too a while off tonight was the first time back and will most likely be the last. Very disappointing",-1

Amy was quick, but I consider that a good thing! She did great work, and I had compliments from 2 random people in 2 different stores the day she did my hair. I will be going back for my up keep.  Thought about rating her a 4 star bc she was a little hard to get a hold of initially, but Like most of us..she's busy! If you can't reach her right away just text her. (For groupon users her # is the one in the instruction box on how to use your groupon with her. Not the one for the salon at the top) Her work was worth the 5!",1

trn_2384,"Ordered lunch for the office from here on Friday. This used to be my favourite go to place for pizza but unfortunately that's not the case anymore. 

The price was decent but the pizza toppings didn't go anywhere near the crust. The garlic bread was awful...just a kaiser bun cut up with butter on it. Really gross. 

And the staff was extremely overwhelmed and unorganized. 

I even saw the pizza guy grab my slice of pizza with his bare hands and throw it into a to go bag...really dude?

trn_2385,"While the food here was good, I am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. Just don't feel like I had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. I would suggest coming here for breakfast, however I highly recommend to avoid the busy hours.",-1
trn_2386,"Gotta love this place.

Where else at 4am after a night of drunken debauchery can you go and eat onion rings and/or pancakes? The food is what you would expect, diner style. I love the retro neon decor and the service is always good, in particular the waitress Dallas. For some reason I always seemed to end up in her section, which is awesome. Ive never been to the lounge side but Ive never really had a need to... perhaps one day.

Great place, I hope it continues to run strong for several more decades and not give in to the corporate sprawl of the strip.",1
trn_2387,"Earl's Transmission!

What a find amongst the many repair shops out there... Let me begin by saying I have a 2001 Pontiac Trans Am with the 4L60E. Anyway, was referred to this shop by a friend even though I received a quote from Bacas National Transmission service already. And that quote was $2300 out the door. Stopped by Earl's and was quoted no more than $2000 with a more realistic range of $1800. 

My order wasn't just a rebuild either. I wanted an upgrade. A mild upgrade which some might call a ""Stage 2."" Able to handle some 500-600 HP. But still very street legal (in fact, not even racing my car-just for streets).

With that being said, everything was done in 2 days with a total of $1886. Not only was the work done fast but it was done at a VERY fair price. Just got the car back today and will be taking her to California very soon. That will be the real test! But I feel very confident and very pleased! Would definitely recommend!  

Thanks Earl and the technicians!",1
trn_2388,"As part of the Buffet of Buffets, we came here for lunch.  I definitely would not pay to eat here if it wasn't for the BoB.  The variety was miniscule and the food was just mediocre.  There was a burrito bar where you can make your own burrito with either carne asada or chicken asada.  Both meats tasted like crap so I didn't have a burrito.  The guacamole didn't taste like real avocados.  The prime rib was ok and all that special.

The service was also pretty slow.  Our waitress disappeared for a period of time and was a real disappointment here.  Overall, not one of the buffets I would choose to go to next time around for the BoB.",-1
trn_2389,"This show is great!  Deducting one star simply because of the staff outside the show.  You cannot enter the theater with drinks, no problem, so we stood by the table they asked us to until we finished, after 5 min the staff came up to us and said we could no longer stand there.  We were not drunk, loud, or inappropriate, we were standing where we were asked and the show still had 10 min before it started.  The ladies were just rude, we are on Vegas, pull the stick out if your ass and have fun Rio staff.  I wish the show would go to a better hotel.",1

trn_2391,If you are looking for an average inexpensive quick burger this is the place. If you are looking for a great burger that makes you say wow! You are in the wrong place. I have no clue where all the hype comes from. Apparently there are many people who have never eaten a good burger to be able to make a comparison. Be sure to get a double as the patties are tiny. Service was fast friendly and efficient.  Bun and fries were fresh,-1
trn_2392,"Calgary has amazing upscale eateries and Rush has been hyped to be part of that elite group.  Swank decor aside; I can't say I can agree given the mediocre overall experience at the restaurant.

The first impression from th entrance is stunning, the interior decor is ultra-modern and sophisticated.  The service is prompt on the slow side  although lacks attentiveness when asking something out of the menu description or receiving the food cooking temperature as ordered or suggested .  

Eight people were in our group, two having specific dietary requirements.  This is supposed to be a seafood and steak house, the steaks came back way undercooked for medium and medium well, while the seafood and particularly the seared salmon were way overcooked for medium.  One of our guests ordered a seared salmon with a salad instead of the starch accompanying it; a rubbery well done fish came to the table with a tiny round cup of sliced butter lettuce and 8 tiny little square green pepper squares (less than penny sized each); the portions left very little to be desired.

All and all, the decor is impressive but the lack of service attentiveness and the food being well below average for the category of establishment ""Rush"" is Branded to be, leads us to keep moving to other downtown Calgary dining explorations; next!",-1
trn_2393,"Not the greatest place in the world, there food is boring and greasy and the girls dont really have a personality. There are better hooters to go to that will give you more for your money. The wings have no flavor really-you ask for hot and it seems like you get mild or wimp. The staff is friendly enough but not friendly enough to frequent this location. The girls dont have ""hooters"" and they have like on cook in the kitchen. Not the worst place, but not the best.",-1
trn_2394,"Just recently went to an Applebee's after years of not being to one. I was pleasantly surprised. Their look has changed and so has the menu, in good ways. Don't get me wrong the place was still filthy but it's changed. And the food was not disappointing. Had the steak with shrimp and it was delicious! Will probably come back and try their new items.",1

trn_2396,"I've taken my daughter around pretty much all of the similar museums in the Midwest, and by far this is the best around!
 
It is not a ""science/tech or children's"" museum so not as much hands-on stuff, so don't make that comparison. It is in the ASTC network so take advantage of that if you have a membership elsewhere. My family plus father-in-law only paid $10 for his senior admission. 

Most museums of ""Natural History"" seem really old and stuffy. The structures and displays seem almost as old as the dinosaurs. Not so in Cleveland. All the exhibits seem fairly new and clean. Everything in working condition. 

Easily fooled from the map and descriptions, but this place is HUGE! 

Big plus is the wildlife center. Today did not reach 60F, so not many animals out, but I can imagine all of them being on display during Spring. Would love to come back here just for that reason.",1
trn_2397,"L'Orignal has a fantastic atmosphere and some great options. Our server Shannon was more then helpful, having great knowledge of the menu.

When you are in Montreal I highly recommend stopping.",1
trn_2398,"Very Beautiful... We stayed for eight days total which is a long time, and i can say we had any complaints. we arrived around 10am and the check in was at 3pm, but after trying to get us to upgrade to a higher floor, because supposedly they didn't have anything else available,(we were prepare to wait ) but they did find us a room with absolutely no view, except the back of another building, but after such long flight, I didn't care. This hotel really does have everything you need we hardly went anywhere else, except to see other shows. The Pallazzo hotel which is basically the same because they are connected, was beautiful, out of 5 restaurants we tried inside the hotel 4 were amazing. The suites are very spacious, the cheapest suite you can get there is really, really nice, loved the decor. The reason I don't give it the five stars is because i thought the beds weren't that comfortable and the pillows are terrible, and I really didn't feel like the Hotel staff doesn't go out of their way to make your experience special, like other big hotel I have stayed at. Places that are a must try at the Venetian hotel and Resort: 
* Morels steak house and French Bistro: very pricey but sooo worth it, they have a special menu for wine and cheese parings is $35 for three different glasses of wine and three little pieces of cheese, the also include honey, preserves and slices of bread...Amazing!!! 
*The Blue man group: great show, very, very funny, great for kids. but beware the front row seats of the theater are the cheapest, and even though they give you a poncho to protect your clothes , you can get wet and or dirty. 

Two things i was looking forward to doing during my stay at the venetian and regret doing: 

* Lavo nightclub: not worth the high cover charge and they huge line to get in, you won't be missing out on anything special. 

*gondolas rides: you pay $16 per person or $64 if you want the gondola to be private, is a 5 min ride, you have to wait about an hour to go on it, kinda of boring... 


Good hotel but it really didn't impress me, next time I'll try something else, maybe I had too many high expectations,but for for the price of this rooms who wouldn't.?",1
trn_2399,"I'll start with the decent: our waitress was nice enough, the cocktail was pretty good, and the happy hour prices were acceptable*

The weird: we sat at a table with these faux Adirondack chairs which fit the style of the porch well, however the table was WAY too high for the low style seats. I am short, so the table was at my collar bone. My husband is tall, and was still uncomfortable. Seems like quite the sacrifice for style. Also seems easily fixable: lower the tables.

The bad: the food is terrible. We ordered happy hour bar snacks, and while expectations for finger food are always low, it was remarkably bad. The pretzels and fondue were definitely not house-made, but previously frozen pretzels and fondue from a can. It is easy to make a fondue, and a reasonable expectation for a restaurant to serve house made fare. The chicken tacos were edible, but the green salsa was like water. 

*If the food had been even decent, the happy hour prices would have been a fair price. However, since I can buy the exact same food at costco and reheat it as they did, I find the prices to be extortion.",-1

trn_2401,"Great collection of pinball machines, old and new!  There is also a wall of video games, including the likes of Paperboy, Frogger, and Donkey Kong.  No shortage on 2 player games, like foosball so bring a friend.

Bring enough cash to play.  There are plenty of change machines and no charge to enter so more to spend.  There is also a soda machine and 25 cent popcorn to keep your hunger at bay.

I was expecting it to be the size of a warehouse bit it was quite smaller.  Don't let that dissuade you because you could be here for days and still not play all the games.  Fun times a short distance from the strip!",1

We got the beet burger and the rainbow tofu vermicelli. The tofu was deep fried to perfection, the noodles were really flavorful and had cabbage and carrot in it. The sweet potato fries were awesome - I highly recommend them. And the beet burger was very different, but very tasty as well with guacamole and hummus. 


If you're wanting something healthy, delicious and different, definitely check out this place.",1
trn_2405,"Had a great meal at Yuva with excellent, friendly, attentive service. And they serve alcohol here! That's awesome as Indian restaurants never serve alcohol!

I've eaten at 10+ different Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh (some no longer with us, RIP Mirchi which was amazing), and this was the best korma I've had in a while (since Mirchi closed). Super flavorful and the goat was excellent. I love that they give you a salad on the side! It's a great palate cleanser with all of the spicy food. (We like it hot). 

The portions were plenty. I think the way that they serve the food and the bowl might give people the impression that they are getting less than other Indian restaurants, but it's a deep bowl. I was stuffed and kept trying to eat more and just finished my leftovers (next day). I'm at home so I'm allowed to lick the bowl --and I did. 

My sig other had the lamb vindaloo. I kept going for his with my naan too! Very good. He was able to finish his meal (dude can put away some food), but was threatening not being able to walk home afterwards. 

Needless to say, the portions are a-plenty. 

We also had a stuffed pepper appetizer that was good, but the dinners were the star. The mango lassi was tasty. I had a nice glass of wine (large wine portion too). 

Expensive? We ordered the two most expensive dinners with the most expensive meats and that was $31. We ordered appetizer, drinks (1 alcohol), dinners, 2 orders of naan and got to the $60s which is what we spend everywhere when we order the same. So no, the price was not unreasonable. 

The different approach to the menu doesn't really make the menu that much smaller. It just lists everything more efficiently. They have tandori, tikka masala, korma, vindalo, aloo gobi, naan, biryani, dahl, etc. It's just listed in a way that makes a more efficient use of space. It's really the kind of Indian restaurant that you can take a non-indian food lover to and they can safely order something that they will enjoy while you still can enjoy a spicy flavor 'splosion.

We live in the burbs, so we aren't in Oakland often, but the next time we are I know that I'm going here. Sorry Lulus.",1
trn_2406,"Saturday at 6:30PM, place was dead.

Ordered the mini chicken sandwich ($2.59), got 2 pc chicken combo and an extra buttermilk biscuit. Biscuits are 99 cents.

The bad:
Mini chicken sandwich - such a small lame sandwich. Horrible. Don't get this. Just don't. It was bland.
Buttermilk biscuits - again, horrible. Tasted like it has been stored away for years and has just been microwaved!! It did taste like an OLD WOODEN CABINET. yes i know what that tastes like. Haha.

The good:
Coleslaw - for my fiance , coleslaw was the way he likes it. Sweet and creamy, crunchy.
2 pc chicken - chicken was good. Juicy. Made to order. Was not greasy. Nothing wrong with the chicken.

Service is non-existent.

Tip: Just order the chicken and nothing else.

Won't be coming back.

trn_2408,"We were there for lunch today and it was ok.  We probably won't go there again though.  The food was average.  The cleanliness was below average.  We ate at the hibachi table and even though there were 8 seats at the table, the hostess sat my hubby and I right up next to the only other couple at the table.  I assumed she was planning on filling up the whole table but once that didn't happen, I felt rude to move.  No big deal really.  They brought out water, soup, and salad and I heard the guy at our table say there was a hair sticking out of his water glass.  The cooktop had plenty of small pieces of food from the people before us but I figured the chef would clean it better before he cooked.  Well, he did wipe the very center but the old food remained.  I really tried to not watch after that.  The food was average.  We didn't have chopsticks at our table which was disappointing.  I'm sure they had them somewhere and I didn't ask so that's my own fault.  I just expect them to be on the table at Japanese restaurants.  Lunch prices were good.  Ill probably stick to my favorites though...Pho Van in the Strip and Mekong in Dormont.",0
trn_2409,"Went here for the first time tonight with my husband and daughter.  This place is great!  Everything that they brought to the table tested great and was freshly prepared.  We had the Wok Wei dinner which comes with soup, appetizer, fried or steamed rice and one entrée for each person ordering.  Wow! the other reviews were not kidding the portion size was crazy big.  On the appetizer they give you egg roll, cheese puff, spare rib and fried shrimp, one each for each person, so we got two of each.  When she brought out the fried rice it was a huge plate, the entree sizes were nice too.  The service was fast and the food was great.  I agree with an earlier reviewer about the egg rolls, these were some of the best I have had.  The price for what you got was very reasonable.  This is our new go to place for Chinese food!!!",1
trn_2410,"I received their menu flyer in the mail at work and was totally impressed with the quality of the graphic design and layout. (It wasn't just some printed paper flyer) I mentally visualized this was a semi-fancy pizza joint with decent pricing.

Just browsing their menu option, it had me crave for a meatball sub. So I decide I might as well check it out.

I was a little surprised to find out it was a little mom n pop shop with a small dining area that could only accommodate 3 parties. But, I absolutely LOVE little hole in the wall places because a majority of the time, the food is delicious. 

They seemed extremely busy with phone orders. Only one other couple occupied a booth; and I decided to dine in as well. I was a little weary because I was a walk in and didn't phone in an order, but the wait was not bad at all. 

I was impressed with their meatball sub. It was made a little different than what I am used to, but was quite tasty. The bread was fresh and toasty. They didn't skim out on the cheese, and the size was well worth the price.

Personally, I was impressed with the quality and pricing. The mom n pop shop ambiance fits the profile. I am excited to come back and try out more on their menu.

I would recommend this place any 9-5 worker who wants to make the most out of their 1 hr lunch break :)",1
trn_2411,"Good spot if you're in Vegas to pick up fast Laos food.  They have a lot of food ready for you to choose from nam, larb, sauce (jel bong, jel maklen)... I always stop by here when I am in town to pick up their jerky, sausage and sticky rice.  Its delicious.  And I take a couple extra back home with me and sometimes store it in the freezer to eat later.  I also get their saku-ya-sai, with the letttuce to wrap it.  Also try their papaya salad too, they make it really good here especially if you request it spicy!!! You can also order ka piek sin or ka pun here and it'll be ready in no time. 
Its a little bit away from the strip(but well worth the drive), you have to take Las Vegas Blvd all the way down past the fremont area and past the 95fwy and it'll be on your left hand side in the corner.",1
trn_2412,We ate there on March 3rd and they food and drinks were excellent! Service was pretty good. The only disappointing part was the fact they were out of one of the items on the menu.

This might be your lucky day"" while looking at his empty dining room. Then starts telling other people who are waiting on a table that they were running out of food. When they questioned him on what he does have his response ""what do you mean. We have a full menu"" but you just said you were out of food. ""No. I said we were out of fish"" then the host continues to argue with the other guests.

trn_2417,"I hired Saiaf Films for my wedding, which was in December 2016. The wedding was in Elk Grove, California. When I first found Saiaf films,I was very impressed by their work. I reached out to them to get more information on the types of packages they had. I was at first hesitant to hire someone that was out of state but, I am so glad I did. After talking to Saiaf Films they ensured everything will be done properly and to meet our expectations. Two team members were sent out for my wedding Hisham and Ridwaan. They contacted me when they got into town and met me at the venue. They were very professional and friendly. They were easy to work with. They worked with me on timing. Things were running behind schedule as they do on weddings and they stuck along and went with the flow. They were very friendly with the guest, and my bridesmaids. I got compliments from guest and family about their work. By the time the reception day came(the next day) it felt as they were our friends and apart of the wedding. They made jokes and made us laugh. We had such a good time having them with us to capture our day. 
Since the wedding I've been in contact with another team never Frank, he's been answering all my questions and explained everything to me about what dates I'll be getting my pictures and films. Once I get the final pictures and films I'll update my review and let everyone know how the pictures and films came out.

trn_2426,"Six for dinner Saturday night at 7:30 or so. Place was full. So waited 10 minutes at the bar and had great $4 Brandy Old Fashioneds. Two of us had the Lobster Bisque. Ok we are in Wisconsin, I wasn't expecting much. It was great! Smooth creamy and actually had Lobster in it! The other four salads. No complaints on the salads, simple side type salad. For our entrees we had a bit of a mix. I had ribs and coconut shrimp. I've read a lot of the reviews here about the ribs. Seems unfair to criticize when rib preparation preference is very wide. Personally I thought they were great! Did they fall off the bone? No but they shouldn't either. Some people like them like mush and that is fine but I'll take a little firmness. These ribs that night came off the bone clean with a slight tug. Great texture and dark smoky bark. Coconut shrimp were a tasty compliment. Others had catfish they really enjoyed. Not like in Texas with small curled pieces but actually corn meal battered filets. The pulled pork was awesome! Here too, not what you usually get with pulled pork. This was nice long strings with some texture, sauce free, with your choice of 4 on the table. Not that mashed up pile of meat buried in sauce that you can't tell what you are eating. Brisket beans were very good and meaty. Hush Puppies were straight out of the South, very good. The prices I thought were very reasonable. We were shocked how low our bill was for 6.

However, I did have the card that I purchased this item on.  Without discussion, she immediately told me she would be unable to exchange the item.  I again explained that I only wanted to swap sizes, but the cashier would not budge from her word.  This is so disappointing.  On that day my husband had planned to do additional shopping, but after this we left.  This is the second time they have been difficult to deal with on an exchange.  They lost an additional sale that day and possible future business from us.  It is pretty sad to say, but next time instead of shopping this local establishment, we will reconsider and may go to a big box store that has been more than cooperative with exchanges.",-1

trn_2431,"All in all, this place is an indoor block out of NYC's chinatown. 

Come here expecting a VERY complete selection of oriental products, crowds, and interesting (that's optimistic) smells. It's huge, 10 or so aisles and a freezer section that spans the entire back wall. From kim chee to canned curry paste to blocks of tamarind to sticky rice balls, they have at least two brands of everything, so there's plenty to choose from. The produce seems to vary, but the standards are almost always represented: bok choy, bean sprouts, etc. 

I will make the trip specifically because of the vegetarian-junk-food frozen stuff they carry. A company called Companion gets very creative with soy and puts out a lot of interesting dim sum/ faux meat options for the buddhist crowd: ""fish"" balls, taro cakes, vegetarian ""pork"" pot stickers and the like. They stock a wide range of this stuff, and it's the only place I've seen it.",0

Most of the other little places I have been to where I enjoy them make them this way.  The dinner menu looks good and I am interested in trying their moules next time I stop in.  I think this is a great place to share some wine, bread, and a dessert during the day.  I can't speak for the dinner yet, but I am looking forward to trying it out.",1

Stuffed peppers were just okay, pretty bland.  We also ordered shrimp cocktail, again just okay ( I love cocktail sauce, and just tasted like ketchup). My girlfriend ordered filet mignon, that was absolutely tasteless. $28.00 for 2 bites.  I am a huge pasta and meatball fan.  The sauce was just tomato minus the flavor. The meatballs were tough, and tasted like they were made with bad meat. Honestly. The price is way too much for the food. Even the presentation was a wilted lettuce leaf... I truly looked forward to an amazing meal here, we left here very dissatisfied with the flavor, presentation, and overall experience. We will absolutely not return.",-1

Upon arrival, the long wait, approx 25 min, led me think that this was some place good.  All the good places have lines right?  There were also many other Chinese and other Asian people there which would also be another indicator.

When I sat down and started getting food, I was a bit disappointed.  Some of the food that should have been hot or at least warm was rather cool.  Not the best sign.  Some of the food was good, but having spent over decade in San Francisco and about four years about 10 miles east of Los Angeles, PPP could not compare to any except the lower quality restaurants that I've tried.

If you want a view, this is the wrong place to go because the casino is right outside the restaurant and that is all you see.",-1
trn_2439,"TL;DR - Unsanitary conditions - do not eat here. 

Long version: 
I ordered two $1 sandwiches and two $1 large drinks last night (receipt says the transaction occurred at 9:57 PM). The cashier wiped her mouth with her right hand, and began panicking because she tasted something disgusting on her hand. She began licking her shirt to wipe off her tongue and proceeded to wiper her mouth again with her other hand as well. She was in the direct line-of-sight of the store manager and other employees (who were loudly joking and cussing at the time). 

I figured that, while this was unprofessional, this would probably not be a big deal because surely someone else would make my drinks or she would surely wash her hands or put on gloves before handling food. 

I was incorrect. 

The cashier, within close proximity to the store manager, proceeded to grab two drink cups, held them by their rims with her fingers touching the inside of the cups, and made the drinks I ordered for myself and my wife. The manager, seeing this go down, did not intervene. 

Once filled, she then placed the cups on the counter. 

Needless to say, I threw those cups away. I called corporate this morning. They said the owner's association in charge of that McDonald's should likely be calling me in the future (but this is the third time I have made a complaint against a McDonald's in Pittsburgh and no one has ever contacted me). Additionally, for some reason Pittsburgh's McDonald's has the least professional workers of any McDonald's I have been to. I have eaten at three different locations (East Liberty, Oakland, Downtown) and not-once was the place operated well (i.e., there were unsanitary conditions or unprofessional staff at all locations). 

If these kinds of things are not dealt with when they occur in front of customers and the store manager, I can only begin to wonder about what else is going on behind the scenes; what other sanitation issues occur out of customer's views? 

I was also not offered a refund or replacement for the two drinks that were ruined by the unsanitary worker. 

DO NOT EAT HERE.",-1
trn_2440,"BEST MEAL IN PHOENIX AREA-
Okay, background to qualify me to say this- I was raised in a family with a parent who is a Food & Beverage Director at very prestigious hotels all over the World. I grew up on 5 star restaurant food and basically lived in hotels. I moved out to the Phoenix area about ten years ago and eat out all the time. I have had meals for two that have cost $300 that didn't taste as life changing as the food at the Centurion.
A work friend has been bragging about this place for years now and for years I thought he was just exaggerating. Nope- wow- our taste buds were dancing with joy!
So this place has a pretty good beverage selection ;-) and the food they serve are Tapas (small plates). I believe there may be certain dishes you can order in an entree size but you'd have to check with them.
Our group sampled a few rounds of different beverages. They are very knowledgeable about their beer and wine choices and will even offer small tastes to pair with your tapas. Their menu is completely seasonal as they use fresh ingredients. We sat in the room with the kitchen, which is extremely small and you would never in a million years expect the quality and flavor in the dishes to come out of that kitchen. 
We ordered many items between two couples, here is what my Husband and I ordered: 
-Risotto of the Day (Pumpkin with a light cheese) x2- and then again at the end of the meal- my husband wanted more too, it was so amazing. Light and creamy and topped off with some very lightly sea salted pieces of delicate pumpkin. Wowza- incredible!
-Papas Bravas - ""Potatoes Pan Fried in A Spicy Pimento Sauce, Finished w/ Chive and Garlic Crème Fraiche"". Most delicious and flavorful potato dish I have ever tasted. It was impressive that the outside had this nice crispiness to it but the inside was so fluffy.
-Chef Eric's Bolognese - ""Over House-made Fettuccini"" - Super flavorful and delicious! 
-Stuffed Mushrooms - ""Stuffed with Pesto Risotto and Wrapped in Prosciutto w/ Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce"" - OMG- Wow, flavor explosion. Cannot stress enough how delicious these are and you will love them regardless of if you like mushrooms. 
-Baked Brie - ""Brie and Raspberry Preserves Baked Fresh to Order -  Inside of Puff Pastry"" - Just melts in your mouth- yummy yummy!
-Pancetta Wrapped Gnocchi - ""With an Aged Cheddar Sauce & Harissa Toast Points"" - Okay, I honestly loved every single item we ordered, but I imagine these flavors in my dreams. This is probably the MOST DELICIOUS thing I have EVER eaten in my life. Wowza- no joke, get here, order this, make your food dreams come true!

We also had two desserts- one light and fluffy like a giant macaroon and the other was their famous chocolate siracha cake. Both delicious! 

Seriously cannot wait to go here again and take everyone I know there for a piece of heaven. :-)",1
trn_2441,"Same story as the other Deer Garden in Scarborough.  This place isn't bad, but it's not as good as it's other counterpart.

Pros:
Choose what goes into your bowl of boodles

Cons:
Food is not as good as other location
Staff feel distant

Gave this place a try because I am a fan of their location in Scarborough.  Coming in, the decor looks a little better than the other location.  I do notice though there are no large booths of any sort.  If you come with a party larger than 4, it could be tricky to sit your party without some sort of effort.  

Once again, we do the usual and go for the noodle bowl which has complete customization.  The prices seem to have gone up as it's now $9.75 instead of $8.75 and the sides have gone up to $2.25 as well.  I get my usual Chaochou style fish and minced pork soup and my GF got the original fish noodle soup.  

The food here doesn't stack up to other location.  I didn't feel I got the same amount of noodles I got at the other location.  The soup was also not as rich.  The taste is there, but the overall quality just seems a little off.  It's still decent value for what you pay, though it could of been better.  If you order a drink, it also doesn't come in the convenient to go container that the other location gives you as well. It's nice to have that convenience so it was something I definitely missed here.

When it comes to service it was hit or miss for us.  There were 3 servers we noted.  1 was very nice and friendly, 1 one was OK and 1 felt very distant.  The one that felt distant never smiled once throughout our visit.  Our little one likes to smile and wave to people she meets.  When the server was leaving our food on the table, our little one smiled at her, waved and said ""Thank you"" to her.  She looked at our little one with a cold stare and just walked away.  I'm not asking you to go out of your way to interact with her, but at least give her a smile back, specially if you make eye contact with her.  You're in the service industry, a smile is not too much ask.  My little one looked back at me confused like she did something wrong after which upset me.  I didn't make a big deal at the restaurant because I'm not that type of person but I was disappointed.  Like I said, the other 2 were more than hospitable, just that experience left a sour taste in my mouth.

This location is still a decent place, I'm just going to be frequenting the Scarborough location for my Deer Garden needs in the future.",0
trn_2442,"Omgsh I ordered the 1/2 kindergarten with vegan cheddar, sautéed onions and peppers and spinach and it was delish! The customer service was pretty smooth from the person who took my order over the phone as well as the 2 ladies who greeted me when I picked it up. Only problem was that some of the chips were a little too salty for me. I will definitely be returning but next time I will get a whole one instead of half! Great job Melt!",1
trn_2443,"I love love love their deep dish pizza here. We were visiting our AZ family in 2014 and they introduced us to this place and honestly we fell in love with it ever since. So whenever we visit them we always make it a tradition. As you can tell this review is so long overdue but I am super excited because we will be back to AZ next week and I'm ready for another one Oregano. 

I've been to oregano multiple times now and I must say the only downfall for each visit is the wait time (but they serve delicious food so it's understandable). So during our first visit here was that we waited for at least 45 minutes to an hour but it wasn't so bad because there were servers walking around and was handing out free garlic bread samples (which tasted amazing). Pretty good advertisement if you were to ask me. The (-1 star) is from the second visit, our family waited for a table for nearly 2 hours and nobody even came to check up on us if we wanted anything. I honestly don't know what happened there. Maybe they were just really busy and they had no time to hand out free garlic bread but honestly it's not even that.. We had kids with us so a simple ""hey guys sorry for the wait.. Do you guys want anything to drink?"" Nothing like that until we got seated. But I'm not mad the food was amazing after all that wait.

Ohhhh also the first visit they had come to ask us if we wanted to order a deep dish pizza while we wait so that when we got seated it'll be ready for us to enjoy.. I think that was pretty awesome and smart thing to do. We will be back oregano! Sometime next week :) I'm soooo ready. Hahaha.",1
trn_2444,"I've been here a couple of times by recommendation from a Korean friend. The Jjamppong and Jjajangmyun are very delicious. It's even better when they're cheaper on the special menu days (rotates every other day). The portions are very generous. I usually share 1 dish with my friend. It's $5.00 (Jjajangmyun - Tues,Thurs, Sat, Sun) and $6.99 (jjamppong - mon, wed, fri).

However, I was a bit surprised at their dish with the steamed buns (I think it's Kochu Japchae)... it was super pricey!!! That dish alone was $20.99 on the special... very little meat, mostly peppers and some other veggies. I'm guessing the expensive part was the steamed buns... 'cause those looked really intricately made.  I think there are actually several pricey dishes they serve on their menu. I'll just stick to the affordable menu items.

In general, I really like their dishes (jjamppong and jjajangmyun), and their service is friendly, but I don't think I can come here without my Korean friend. It seems like the servers don't speak English, and there is no translated menu...",1

Next comes the entree.  I almost always order the Jack Beef Shabu Shabu but they offer Sukiyaki and have shrimp, chicken and pork as well.  The Shabu Shabu comes with rice and three dipping sauces (spicy, sesame peanut and ponzu)  The night ends with a perfect scoop of ice cream.

We got there early so we didnt have to wait long (around 6:30pm), but by the time we were leaving, there were a lot of people waiting.

The inside is pretty cool with people eating hot pots, sharing food at the elevated tables so you need to take off your shoes, and a different area for shoes on. 

Our service was was quick and to the point. When we sat for a little too long for their taste, we were handed the bill on the table without words. HST is included - wow! 

I was surprised that the menu had simplified chinese on it, and thought maybe this place was run by mainland Chinese, but it's hard to tell if were because all the servers were korean and everything felt it (joint venture? Great marketing?)

My friend  had a dumpling soup ($8). The dumpling was just okay but the soup was really good. I had the kalbi (beef short ribs) ($19) and it came on a sizzling plate with scissors. The portion was large but i thought i wouldnt be able to finish everything when it came, but oh I totally did.

It's next to the freeway and major street so it's noisy. The hotel is also in front of a bus stop which is convenient but people hang out there a little too much. The hotel is gated poorly. Front gate never closes. Anyways, after a 5 hour drive and 5 hours at work, I looked forward to a nice room to lay my head. The room was filthy regardless if I made a reservation. The shower and sink was covered in hairs. Watched a spider climbed the wall. People were hanging outside my room smoking/vaping and just hanging out in the car facing my room. I felt uncomfortable. Didn't want to make deal about it so I just asked to switch rooms. The next room I switched over to was better but still bad. Smelled like smoke even if the room was a nonsmoking room. The bed sheets had cigarette burns, and I couldn't breathe comfortably so I just decided to go to another hotel. This was around 7:30.

And my husbands eggs were slightly overcooked. My poached eggs were more like barely cooked eggs, they were pretty much inedible unless I'm trying to drink my eggs like I'm in a rocky movie...

trn_2467,"Wait ... it can't be true ... I get to be the first one to review this great place?  Well, we'll see when this posts ...

Anyhow, if you are in Las Vegas for the museums, at some point you'll hit those on Industrial, like the Elvis-a-Rama -- what?  it's closed? don't let *that* stop you -- and the Erotic Heritage Museum (oh, not *your* heritage? okay ...); and when you are hungry, slide up just a bit further to the north (why is Downtown to the north?) and stop by this great restaurant.

I think it's Mexican.

Whatever, the food is really, really good.  Try the tacos.  Really, really good.  Everything reasonably priced.  Just head to the counter and order up.  They'll bring it up to you.  Yes, the place looks like a set from a Tarantino movie, but the people there are friendly and -- did I mention this already? -- the food is really, really good.  You'd imagine that it was made by a celebrity chef.  But you'd know it wasn't because you can afford it, and don't have to con yourself into thinking that you like small portions at high prices.

By the way, what's up with the little residential neighborhood between this place and, say, the Stratosphere?  The streets with all of the city names:  Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, New York ... until I came upon Cleveland, I figured it was the set of all cities pre-1953 with baseball teams in both the American and National Leagues.  Still, no Oakland or Atlanta or ....  no, I guess there is a Baltimore.  Never mind ....

Also, why get a so-so room for one night at, say, the Venetian, for $425, when for that money you can get a full month -- move in that day -- at the Boston Garden ... and take half your meals at Las Delicias.  You suppose they have a line-cutting card?",1

We ordered over the phone and picked up at a busy dinner time.  The restaurant itself was filled (which is a good sign!) and the food was ready in 15 minutes.  The restaurant really would needs a website and online menu.

trn_2479,"Doesn't seem sanitary to me...

I was extremely excited to try this place because of reviews and photos of their pizza online. I base almost everything off of reviews because reviews from peers always tell the story, granted there are always garbage reviews that are negligible...regardless. My experience was terrible. 

First off, if you step inside you will be disgusted, unless you like ordering food in a smoke pit. Went early evening, left in two minutes smelling like an ash try. The guy working there was super nice, however, the woman was extremely rude to the other employee while he was taking our order. Talking in a condescending fashion to him and yelling at him while he was talking to us. Not a great second impression. Once we were told it would be a 40 min wait we decided to leave and come back next time to try it, didn't feel like waiting tonight. After leaving (after two minutes like previously stated), I couldn't believe how much we smelled of smoke. Thinking about it, this concerned me as this pizza shop is constantly open to the bar. I don't like the idea of my food being exposed to smoke 24/7 prior to it even getting prepared.

I see other reviews talking of the smoke and most with people ordering delivery. If those of you who order delivery saw the atmosphere your food is prepared in i'm sure you wouldn't be as enthused about the product.

Don't get me wrong, I love bar food and frequent others in town, however, the cook area is never open to the smoke area...never in my experience! Whether it's a door or something that divides them. The ordering window is always open meaning the food is always exposed and at this point, all the food back there has been soaking in the smoke of all the people at the bar for the last few weeks...disgusting the more I think about it. 

In the end, never ate the product, although I'm sure it might be good, just might try another location...definitely not this one",-1
trn_2480,"If you want to relive your misspent youth, or get a flavor of where to go after the sock hop ends, this is the place. Tasty, tasty hot dogs, hamburgers, and the usual sides, plus milkshakes and other desserts. Pull up and order from your car, or sit outside or inside. I often get a hankerin' for a coney dog in the summer, and I really enjoyed the Retro Dog. Hot dog was perfect and a nice soft bun to keep the coney sauce to hot dog ratio just right. The Carolina dog had a flavorful complement of coleslaw for a mellow blend of dog and vegs. Got cheesy bacon fries, which have some heat due to the spicy fries coating. Onion rings were also good. They are also open late when there are events going on at Blossom.",1

trn_2485,"I worked three different summers at the Canadian National Exhibition in my high school and undergraduate years. I visited and walked by the Queen Elizabeth Building countless times. How come I never knew about the Queen Elizabeth Theatre until I booked ticket to see Erasure at this venue?!

I drove down there on a Tuesday evening. It was pouring rain. I saw some staff members on strike in front of the venue. I was also trying to figure out where to park.

Finally, I pulled into a lot across from BMO Field's gate 4. I spoke to a friendly woman who said that parking was $12. Credit cards are accepted. I was thrilled. I parked and walked over to the theatre.

Apparently, this theatre has been there since 1956 and was renovated as a concert venue in 2010. After you go through security (I opened my purse up and had the security guy peruse), the lobby greats you. It is cozy and inviting. You can grab a drink from the bar and sit down in a comfy chair.

The doors to the theatre opened and we all walked in. It was my first time at the venue. I got help with getting to the right row and seats.

There isn't a bad seat in the house. The acoustics were great. It's an intimate venue. It does get a bit stuffy when it's hot and humid outside, though. Perhaps the combination of other Erasure fans being there and all of us dancing made the theatre's temperature rise.

I had a terrific time seeing Erasure. It had been a decade since I last saw this duo.

Although there are roughly eight stalls in the women's washroom, expect a wait. Otherwise, it's a great place to see a show.

Other than that he was OK, especially when talking about basketball.",0

Ordered a cold milk tea, didn't know it was more expensive than the hot one. i asked if i could switch it to a hot one,and she refused. I understand that it was my fault not looking at the menu properly,but she gave me attitude afterwards and didn't even say thank you after i paid. 

I returned to the booth to grab a pair of chop sticks because i had some food to eat. She gave me the dirtiest look ever,and even after i left she kept starring at me.

I've had appointments with Laurie for physio and acupuncture, Lise for massage and Morgan for naturopathy over the last 4 months and these women are at the top of their game.  The best part is that they confer with each other so there's no need to repeat information.  

They also direct bill my insurance which is a huge bonus.  And, they're right downtown at Yonge and Adelaide. Happily, the clinic opens at 7am so appointments can easily be worked around my work day.  I also found out that I can bank funds for treatments when my insurance runs out.  Just one more thing to love about this clinic!

trn_2506,"I was born and raised in KCMO, so I have quite high expectations when it comes to barbeque. Smoky Jon's is not bad by any means, but it has lots of room for improvement. 

Pros:
- Smoky Jon's meats are very tender, cooked well, and taste as though they are slow-cooked/smoked. (I didn't notice a liquid smoke flavor; using liquid smoke would be cheating!) So the meats, in my opinion, are five stars.
- Mac & cheese is yummy. 
- Cute, BBQ-style restaurant atmosphere.
- Friendly service.

Cons:
- Beer-battered cod sandwich should not come with BBQ sauce -- that's weird. 
- BBQ is all about the sauce. Smoky Jon's sauce is too watery and too peppery. This was the consensus of my group of four who all agreed that the sauce was much too peppery.
- Women's bathroom really needs cleaning. A customer should not see an obvious mold ring around the water line of the toilet. The dirty bathroom also bothered me because the bathroom opens up into the dining room -- it's not down a back hallway away from food.
- Real dishes would be nice for diners dining in.

While I don't think Smoky Jon's is bad, I have experienced better BBQ before, so I can't rate beyond three stars.",0

trn_2510,"I had a week trial here. While the facility is ok (enjoyed the sauna & loved the spin class) sales tactics are weird.

Before the trial, i made the horrible mistake of giving these guys my phone number...... Don't do that foreal. They will call you 5 times a day and ask when you're coming in for the trial.

The week I gave them my number was a busy week for me. I had a lot going on and in the middle of that, my best friend from high school suddenly passed away. 

The guy wouldn't stop calling, texting and leaving voicemails. Finally I answered and he asked when I was coming in. I mentioned I had a rough week because my friend passed away and her viewing was that night. 

He said that he was sorry for my loss then literally said ""well viewings are usually from 5-7. Could you come down at 8 to view the place and start your free trial?""

Absolutely disgusting. I can't make this up for real.

Never give these people your number. They walk up and down E Carson asking people to sign up for free trial and they ask for your number. Seriously don't give it to them. They'll call you once an hour every day until 9pm.

Even if the gym was phenomenal (it's not), the shitty sales tactic is horrible. I live a block from this gym. The week free trial was cool but after that I never thought of becoming a member. 

Enrollment fee Prices are extremely high and if they're offering ""free enrollment!"", they give you a higher  monthly bill to make up for it. This information came straight out of the sales guys mouth when I asked about waiting until free enrollment during my week trial

by the way- pictures are deceiving and pure false advertising. there is no pool, no volleyball court and no basketball court. the only thing this gym has to offer is a a 2 story work out area, classes  and a sauna",-1

trn_2513,"The Cheesecake Factory is an extremely mediocre restaurant that is way too hyped up by Drake fans residing in the GTA. With that being said, the line-up to get in had my friend and I waiting almost 2 hours on a Tuesday afternoon. Nevertheless, we waited in the line to soon be greeted by a waiter that seemingly rehearsed his every word moments before he served our table. Despite the awkward waiter, my friend and I both ordered burgers, and to our disappointment they weren't nearly as tasty as the waiter described. After browsing the extensive list of cheesecakes, we ordered one plain strawberry and one chocolate. You would think a restaurant with the name ""The Cheesecake Factory"" would exceed expectations of any regular cheesecake. The cheesecakes were fine, but tasted like nothing special. Overall, if I'd had known, I wouldn't have waited in the line for a mediocre lunch. Although The Cheesecake Factory met my expectations of a restaurant, they did not, in the very least, exceed them. Honestly, I think Drake sang about his date fighting with him at ""Cheesecake"" because she probably was under impressed that DRAKE would take her to such an over-hyped, and severely average restaurant.",0

Amusingly, it's basically a Subway with Tex-Mex, but higher quality.  The meat is all organic which makes it actually pretty tasty.   They do a pretty good job at moving the line through too and never have an issue with custom orders (extra rice, extra corn, etc).

Always get a similar item, and regardless of where you go, most Chipotle's are similar.   The corn might be a little hotter in some places versus others, but that's about it.

Believe me.  You could eat here every day for weeks on end.   I have before.  And it's just.... so... yummy.",1
trn_2516,"The Dowd has great facilities, large locker rooms complete with Steam and Sauna facilities, every fitness class you can think of, basketball courts, a pool...

It's the ideal place to go to stay fit.

The one drawback is that it's not without some sketchy activity.  Recently, I was changing after a workout, and I saw these two guys walking around the locker room.  I didn't think much of it, but someone who was changing beside me said,
""Hey - what are you two doing?""
""Nothin man, we're waitin for ****""
""I see you casin' the place, I left for a shower you were walkin around, I get back from my shower, you still walkin around""
""No man, we're just waitin for ****""

So the guy who is calling these two sketchy dudes out walks over to the emergency phone, picks it up and calls the front desk.

The two sketchy dudes, are acting all tough and cool about it, but literally proceed to walk out of the locker room, up the stairs and out of the building.  

I happened to finish up around that same time, and walked out about a minute after them.  I saw them get into their car and drive off - so much for waiting for their ""friend""!

As I'm watching them leave, another guy who left at the same time as me and was headed home or to work or something says to me,

""I can't believe it - they were definitely here looking to get into people's lockers""
""Yea, definitely, I'm surprised"", I reply
The guy says to me ""I actually had my locker broken into here not too long ago, my wallet was stolen...""

The moral of the story is this - either bring a freakin masterlock with you, or don't change at the gym and just enjoy the facilities!

Oh and one more thing - for the money?  the Y charges you based on your income, so if you make decent money, you'll spend $100 a month for 2 people.  That to me is a bit on the pricey side...",0

trn_2535,We love Paul! My wife lucy has been going to Paul for her hair care for five years now. We were very lucky to find him as we moved to Las Vegas in 2012. She is in the entertainment business and Paul makes her look as beautiful as she can be. Very Important! The extensions that he gets are the finest quality. ( last batch were 24 inch blond )The work that he does is top notch and we are very pleased! It looks like My wifes own hair as I stand 12 inches away and look at it. His coloring is spot on perfect. Paul is a total professional and we recomment him to any and all! And yes we still drive to vegas from Southern California now for him to do her hair. Thanks Paul. Your the best!,1
trn_2536,"So, I've learned to NEVER expect much from taco bell ESPECIALLY around Champaign County but this place... this place is even worse than the Rantoul taco bell, which is quite amazing. 
Let's just talk about today, shall we?
I saw the commercials for the new Nacho fries and wanted to try them. This taco bell is close to work so I chose to go there.
I purchased the Nacho Fries Box. The fries were literally cold. Not warm or luke warm but an actual chill AND they were all smashed.
The Doritos taco was crushed, the ""gordita"" crunch...the gordita tortilla was soggy and stuck to the wrapper and completely fell apart when I tried to remove it.
The cheese sauce was in a large container and there was literally just enough to cover the bottom of the container. 
Oh! The drive thru employee greeted me ""Ya, what can I get ya?"" 
Pathetic.",-1

My wedding dress was shipped to me from CA and arrived a mere 4 weeks before my wedding. It was much too large and needed several (fast) alterations (hem, zipper, gords, shoulder straps, and taking it all in at least 2-3 sizes). I was also going out of town for 10 days and therefore had only 2 weeks to work with. I am so thankful I found Janet. She is a design wizard, and altered my dress 4 times as I continued to lose weight before the wedding. She was fast, professional, personable, kind, detail-oriented; I truly cannot praise her enough!

My second stay was much warmer and I even got a thank you goody bag from the GM.

trn_2547,"I was really looking forward to trying out Streetcar Po-boys and bugged my co-workers to go in with me for well over a month.  Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. Our order from three of us consisted of a Zulu (eggpland and zucchini marinara), a Viex Carre (BBQ beef), and a French Quarter (meatball marinara).  Each sandwich came with a side of coleslaw (very good and creamy, BTW) and some fries.  There weren't many fries to be had.  Just a small handfull.  What there was of them was very seasoned to the point that my co-workers claimed they were too spicy.  I disagree but that is not the point of my story today.  My boss ordered the viex carre and said the BBQ sauce was too spicy.  She was only able to eat a small portion of her rather pricey sandwich.  My co-worker ordered the French Quarter.  She did care for it due to small meatballs cut in half and the lettuce, pickles, mayo, etc.  That I take the blame for.  When I ordered I was asked if I wanted the sandwiches dressed.  I said yes.  My bad.  On hot sandwiches like any of the marinara style or a BBQ beef sandwich, cold toppings just really don't belong.  On my Zulu I would not mind the tomato or the pickles.  Soggy shredded lettuce is where I draw the line.  Amazingly enough this is exactly what I received on the side in a small cup.  A small styrofoam cup of shredded lettuce and marinara.  I don't know if it was meant as a side dish or as extra for the sandwich itself.  I don't like when I am confused by food.  Setting that aside, I actually kind of liked my Zulu sandwich.  There was a good amount of eggplant and zucchini and sauce and the flavor was good.  It was not especially filling but I was not starving afterwards either.  I would have been happier had I been able to order the corn fritters I have seen pictures of.  Unfortunately, Streetcar's provider/distributor of such delights no longer has the fritters available.  And so it was that no sides were to be ordered.  Nor were desserts which is too bad because some of them look really good.  I may just have to make a special dessert visit some day but when it comes to sandwiches, I'll pass.",0

Good things (relative to the other place)
Price, service, friendliness, freshness.
Not-so-good things... 
Not as much variety as I'm used to, the rolls that are not spicy in the other place, we're spicy in this place. 
So, the rolls that were spicy in the other place, were too spicy in this place.
Larger than the other place, so for lunch, it wasnt too crowded. 
The chefs weren't as talkative as in the other place, but today, I didn't mind.
Speedy in-and-out, which is always a plus.
It's got ""AYCE appeal."" I should copyright that phrase.
Not as bright atmosphere as the other place, but that's okay. 
I would still classify it as child-friendly.
Bathrooms were clean.
Plenty of parking.
What else...Nope, that's about it.

VIBE 
It's really exciting to see another pop up success story! I think Rock Lobster perfectly fits the atmosphere of Ossington in Watusi's old space and will bring the hipsters and foodies in droves. The murals are ""instagram"" worthy decorated by owner Matt Petit himself and the seating works as a place where you can chill out. 

That said, the music is LOUD. Like Rock N' Roll, Bruce Springsteen loud so sometimes you can't hear your campanion. 
Service is A Plus -- even when it's busy everyone from the owner to the waitstaff are making sure you're taken care of. 

WE ATE 
I was lucky to be at a media event and get a sampling of everything. The lobster rolls here are classic but the additions are also really exciting (and no, it's not all lobster!). 
I loved the seafood platter with oysters, shrimp and lobster--it gets a bit messy but it's fun. The flank steak with hickory sticks and egg added with sailor jerry rum sauce was a big hit with our table as well and gives a more casual vibe to the whole ""surf and turf mentality."" It was nice to see something healthy on the menu as well like the beet salad and that gave the meal a bit of balance as well. The Cripsy Maple Pork belly with creamed spinach and micro greens was YUM! Nicely executed and presented. 

Misses: the lobster poutine - I like my cheese more gooey and less curdy; the Caesar salad; the rolls are great but a bit mayo heavy --the pickle really cuts through that though (and the pickles are BIG so that's a hit not a miss!). I'm not as much of a fan of the whale tail either --I like the Canadiana effort but it would be cool to see a more inventive dessert that's easy to eat (kind of like Grand Electric's key lime vassos) but doesn't break the bank (like under the $5-6 mark). 

DRINK: Rock Lobster has teamed up with Sailor Jerry spiced rum to deliver some kick a** drinks by superstar bartender Josh Lindley. Though I didn't have it, his caesar with a lobster tail seems to have everyone talking; My favourite drink was the Norman Collins -- Sailor Jerry with lime juice and elderflower. It's simple and packs a punch. If you're a fan of campari, you'll like the Barel Aged Flying Colours drink: rum with campari, cherry heering and peychaud bitters aged in a tequila barrel for 30 days. If you're not a fan of campari, you'll take one sip and move on to the Norman Collins. It's a VERY strong drink! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Rock on! We were here on a Wednesday and it felt like a jam packed Saturday. A new place for Ossington to call their own.",1
trn_2551,"One way you can tell if the food is good is if the actual type of people that eat there are that nationality.  Well here is a place that has great food, really nice waitresses and inexpensive cuisine.  You can get a ton of food under $10 and Chips and salsa galore!  the drink specials are great there too!",1
trn_2552,"BEST BBQ of my life and cooked WITHOUT SAUCE from this hole in the wall barbecue stand - you MUST eat here before you die!

This is one of the main reasons I love being a Yelper, yes we would love to rate places fairly to help people make choices, but ultimately we're always looking to discover that one incredible gem of a place that knocks the socks off of what they do so we can tell the whole world all about it!  And of all my 100 plus reviews I've written so far, this is my FIRST ONE!  You simply have to come here someday, I don't care how, just do it!

PLEASE NOTE - THEY ARE ONLY OPEN FOR LUNCH!!

Their barbecue here is smoked to perfection using simple spices without any of those sauces! Sure they have some incredible sauces on the side if you like to use them, but I highly recommend against it!  Not with the flavor of these meats!!

They offer brisket, fatty brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, turkey and sausage!  You know what I did? You guessed it, I ordered them ALL!  Best choice I ever made!

I had super high expectations after seeing their 5-star rating with over 1300 reviews, but even my expectations were surpassed! I'm not going to go on and on about the flavor, all I will tell you is it's the best and they don't smother it in sauces, they smoke it just right using simple spices to bring out the meats own most delicious flavor!

Parking here is tight so I suggest coming before noon. Hopefully there will only be about 20 or 30 people in line at that point. If you're lucky. Nobody leaves the line, everybody waits patiently to reach the meat slicer, who cuts your meat in front of you. Then they give you sides and drinks. 

Not much seating, a few tables inside some extra tables outside in the back underneath a roof. But let's face it, you're not here for a fancy restaurant, are you?

This is a ""must go to"" place, go out of your way to go here if you need to! Don't miss out!  My favorite Yelp discovery to date!",1

Staff are always attentive and very helpful with pairings.",1
trn_2557,My first time there. Sandy my waitress was amazing. She made my first experience a memorable one. I even got a hug . The Diablo pizza was to die for. just the perfect amount of spice . Great recommendation sandy. Can't  wait to come back and bring more friends. Till then .,1
trn_2558,"If it wasn't for the cool speakeasy style restaurant this would be a 1 star for the value. 

Location and Parking: Great location. Away from the busy streets of old town and mill but close enough to venture there before or after. Plenty of parking.

Style: This restaurant has a classy speakeasy feel but casual attire is fine. The restaurant is open until 12am and the bar open until 1am. It's hard to find someone serving ""upscale"" food  past 10pm so we were excited to check this place out.

Now for the very unfortunate part.

The food: Wow, just the worst value ever. We ordered Shrimp Cocktail, 2 glasses of champagne, market bay scallops and lobster stuffed shrimp. 

First we got the bread and champagne. Everything was going great. The bread came in huge slices and was fresh. It didn't come out warm but it was still fresh and tasty. It was served with a whipped butter. I prefer oil myself but it was good. The champagne was great.

Then we got our shrimp. It had that refrigerator taste to it. Like it was made earlier in the day and then wrapped in plastic and thrown in the fridge. We could both taste it. It wasn't the worst shrimp ever and we did eat all 5 jumbo shrimp but we were a little turned off already. 

Then we got our salad. We got the house vinaigrette as a dressing. Salad was fine. Lettuce was fresh. It was presented poorly though. I'm not usually a stickler on presentation but if you're charging $40-50 a plate I figured some effort was coming. It looked like a diner salad and for some reason they give you a huge heap of mushrooms on the side. Whatever, salad is a salad. We were still optimistic about this place. It was so cool and classy and close to home that we wanted to love it. Still no real complaints.

Then the dinner came. Ew man. Ew. My Scallops were flavorless. I was expecting big scallops seared and delicious. Instead, I got these miniature flavorless scallops served with a side of broccoli covered in some type of sour cream sauce. And this weird seasoned lemon as a garnish. The presentation was horrendous. It looked like a dish you get from a Mexican restaurant. As soon as we were served we gave each other that, ""what the hell is this"" look.

Her dinner was just as bad. Her stuffed shrimp had shells in it. She literally took one bite and didn't want to eat anymore. I tried to eat a few more pieces of the scallops but it was not good. The sides were even worse.

We dropped $115 plus $20 tip. We frequent nice restaurants and have no problem spending on good food. Check our review history. Take my word for it or be disappointed, the value for this place is simply not there.",-1

trn_2561,"Worst MAC location ever!!! After repeated attempts and fails I am no longer returning to this MAC even though it is the closest to my house... I am even considering switching my holy grail eyeliner to another brand entirely as the people who work MAC counters generally look like street walkers (and not in a good way- if there is a good way!)- not edgy, like I think they are going for! They are lazy and you have to go over to them and get in their face to get them to help you and basically hand them the product. And then they don't even say 'hi' or ask 'how are you?'- you know, the bare minimum that is to be expected in ANY human intereaction- let alone a customer service interaction at a retailer where they want my money!  I used to spend tons at MAC and now I have moved on to more luxurious things and better service at the Chanel counter... though definitely not at this Dillards- the customer service is atrocious all over at this mall! I really don't know how some of these people have jobs.  Sorry if some of my reviews seem harsh lately, but I am no longer standing for this kind of crap service.",-1

This store however, could only muster up a 3 stars from me because I've been here many times and each time have been disappointed by the selection and sizes they have. I've gone different times of the year, different times within one week when they supposedly got a shipment etc. and never anything comes in reasonable size.

This isn't the fault of the sales associates there or even the store, but if a store never has what you want ... then it's not really a five star experience. Furthermore, they're so barren it's sad ... they have this huge spinning wheel above the register, supposedly you spin it for a free gift (the number it lands on corresponds to a mystery gift) when you make a purchase. Sadly, it's been ""out of gifts"" for the past 3 years. So what's the point of having the wheel still?

One perk is that because this is the original CL boutique (there is a new one in Caesar's Palace the Forum Shops), they actually have SALE items. Again, finding your size could be a challenge but still.. SALE!",0

trn_2569,"This place takes the (pan!)cake for cozy morning breakfast.

Growing up in the South Hills, this is where you tried to go every Saturday morning.  Note I definitely said TRIED, as if you arrive after 11, you better be very patient.  This place is small and people love to relax and stay a while.  However, this is one of the few spots I will leave the house for before noon on the weekend.

You might have seen the spot on the Food Network.  If not, look it up.  The owner and her daughter are crazy endearing.  The focus here, of course, is on the pancakes.  This is the only place I know of that serves pumpkin pancakes year round, and it is for a reason.  These are dense and sweet, enough that even I don't syrup them.  A little whipped butter in a paper souffle cup and a dash of salt (hey, don't knock it 'til you try it), I can clear three or so in a few minutes.

They also have staple breakfast items, along with the jumbot. At least one of the guys in my party always goes for the ham on the bone/jumbot.  If you can fit this thing in your body, go for it.  The only other unique item to try would be the stuffed french toast.  Personally, between syrupy fruit filling (compote is too kind a word for this ice cream topping inside) and then topped with more fruit syrup, it tastes more like a heavy dessert for me, but I know those who swear by this as their weekend treat.

If you find yourself on the other side of the Liberty Tubes on an early morning, you need to go get pumpkin pancakes.  You can even call ahead for it to be ready for take out and avoid the mess of hungry Dormont-ers along the Potomac sidewalk, but then you'd miss making new friends with your slightly brash waitress and the infamous specials on the tiny chalkboard.  Either way, depending on your timing, this diner will hit the very top on your breakfast list.",1

The Gin and tonic sat so long at the bar there was barely any ice. It took about another 20 min to even order our food and once we ordered it took 35 minutes for simple wings and fries. Once the wings came out they were cold but didnt want to send them back just to wait another 30 min. All around a pretty horrible experience.

trn_2591,"A group of friends and I stayed here and reserved a 2 bedroom with living room and full kitchen. we were pleasantly pleased with the room till morning rolled around and we were woken to horrible nonstop banging, we later found out that they were reflooring the room above us at 8 am in the morning! We were not happy and slept crappy because of this. Joel the manager called us back and rearranged another stay for us, Im really glad I took him up on his offer because the second time around was so much better. I would stay here again in the future.",1

I've only ever done takeout here, but I've never waited for my food and they have always gotten my orders correct. Egg drop soup, with the wontons and spring rolls are my favorites for lunch- that being said, they have some healthy lunch options, with serving sizes for leftovers for dinner. Worth it. 

It is a hole in the wall, which also happens to be the best kind of restaurant you can go to. Love this place",1

I was really excited to order the mama grubbys from reading a lot of the reviews. But the bagel came out really small. It didn't have the perfect round bagel form, it was deformed n misshaped. It didn't even cover most of the egg/avocado/cheese/tomato that was in between it. Was hard to eat since the ingredients kept falling out. The avocado was fresh though.",0
trn_2598,staff were very rude. rude on the phone and Im not sure if Ive registered or not. The guy smugly tells me according to the law he cannot discuss my info over the phone. LIE. many other dispensaries do express ordering over the phone and you HAVE to give them your info over thew phone. All I said is Im not sure if I have registered.. he tells me those are dispensaries are commiting a crime and that is against the law. wow. just wow.,-1

Very reasonably priced too.
Will definitely be back.",1

He was absolutely amazing. During this very difficult time Jon Reed was there for me at the drop of a hat. It didn't matter if I send him an email at 11 o'clock on a Sunday night or try to reach him at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday. His response was always within moments. he knew all of the answers to all of my questions and led me through the probate process very professionally. I felt most comfortable under his guidance. congratulations to you on an excellent drcision...should you choose such a wonderful attorney to assist you.",1
trn_2601,"Tried pizza and wings at this place today. Pizza was acceptable (the works) but the wings were not that good, they seemed to be leftover wings from couple days ago. The person prepared my wing order doesn't know how to count to twelve because we  got 11 wings for the order of 12. Missing 1 bad wing was not a big deal but the feeling of your order was messed up when you checked it out at home was unpleasant. So if you ordered takeout, make sure you open your boxes and check before you leave.",-1
trn_2602,"went to this location to wash a cal king comforter and they did have a washer large enough. $5 just to wash it, I think that is a bit extreme but then I don't frequent laundromats often. In the other washer towels, robes, and mattress cover another $5. Again these are the large machines 50lbs. 

Unlike the other reviews I was not greeted so friendly, the person working there just kept shouting at me HELLO?! about 4 times. Later on the same lady began shouting instructions at me about how to operate the washer. I never asked for help, pretty self explainitory, close door, put in soap and money machine turns on.",0
trn_2603,"Every In-n-Out is expected to be some what the same. At this location I give a four star not because they are but because the service is great. 

The food is a hit or miss at this location and that's not a good thing. It so isn't that bad. I mean some times it's like OH MY GOD this is why I love In-n-Out and sometimes it's like ummmm, it's just not all that great. 

Tonight never the less was a good night. The Resturant is pretty much always busy by the way but food always seem to come out at a decent time. Tonight the buns were toasted perfectly where the edge is buttery and crunchy and the burger is juicy. The fries are the fries but this time it was not too hard and not too soft and with just the right amount of salting.

There was a good size line in the drive thru lane (not too big to where there had to be a live person outside taking curb side orders) but a size. With that said food was fresh and line moved quick. It is also nice that the drive thru is all glass and you can see them cooking inside which is entertaining and makes you forget that you are waiting when you are killing time in line. 

Anyhow I haven't yet had a bad experience with service every time have been extremely pleasant but food needs to be consistence. 

I give them  2 thumbs up!",1
trn_2604,"Ok it's seriously good. That is all you need to know.  Small, one person cooking, worth the wait (usually isn't one).   We are regulars.",1
trn_2605,"Great service!! Came here on a Monday because a friend told me about their sushi being half off on Mondays and Tuesdays.

The place is fairly new so of course it is super clean.  They have options for booth or chair seating so it is handicap friendly.

They seem to have a full bar but I haven't tried many drinks since I do have to study after dinner.  On Wednesday to Sunday they have deals on domestic and imported beers.  For domestic beers it is $2.00 and import beer is $3.00.  On Fridays and Saturdays they have all house wines at $3.00.  Their martini and cocktails are buy 1 get 1 for 50% off on Fridays and Saturdays.  The bar area is limited seating and can only fit 10 people.

The sushi is very fresh and made right to order! As soon as we got our sushi, you could tell it was freshly made from the texture of the fish.  The spider roll was still warm as soon as we got it which was awesome and crispy!

Overall the sushi was deliciously fresh and quite affordable compared to some sushi restaurants.  The service is super fast when you come before rush hour so you don't have a long wait time! I would definitely recommend this place for anyone in the area craving great food and service!",1
trn_2606,"The portions were huge, the banana pudding was crazy delicious. Even though we were full, we ate the entire thing! The service was outstanding and our server gave great recommendations. The fried chicken was crispy, tender, and though I hate this word, moist. The Mac and cheese was fine, could have been hotter, but was good. They had an extensive beer selection as well.  Overall, we enjoyed our experience and would return next time in Vegas.",1
trn_2607,"If your pee pee is micro, I promise I won't tell. But the Microtel will, so be careful.

This may or may not have happened in 2013 which is why it's review #2,013.

I had the hottest liason of my life here... can I put that on Yelp? Oh okay, well I just did. A girl who is famous (I can't tell you who she is) decided she wanted to come and hang with me, but not in Buffalo (I'm not sure what she has against Buffalo), so she chose Pittsburgh. She chose a cheap hotel, but it was actually lovely. It had a comfortable bed, and was clean - what more can you ask for, for a liason? We didn't do any sleeping whatsoever. I picked her up at the airport, we went to the room for maybe 6 hours, no sleeping, lots of outfit changes (her, not me. Nobody gives a sh** what outfit I wear, lol). Then out for late-night food all over Pitt. Then back to the room for another 6 to 8 hours (no sleeping). And so on, and so forth.

It's not really fair on other hotels, because I haven't been to those hotels with this particular girl, but that's not my fault. All I can do is give this hotel the 5 it deserves for giving us absolutely no problems whatsoever on one of the best nights of my life.

You might think that a poor starving artist who has never had a hit on Billboard probably doesn't really figure on the radar of celebrities. But this is not the first female celebrity who has taken an interest in me. However she is absolutely the best one. We're still very good friends and hopefully I'll be seeing her again very soon. I think she reads my Yelp reviews actually, so hopefully this one will score me some extra brownie points. Literally, brown because she's so damn tanned. In a good way.

I keep getting distracted, I'm trying to watch ""Man Vs Food New Orleans"" but instead I had to go look up pix of the girl in question. She's all over the internet, lol. But don't be jealous. I actually like boys, not girls. I just do a remarkable job of pretending otherwise because my mother is a raging homophobic.",1
trn_2608,"Went here for summerlicious and ordered the calamari, fish and chips and ice cream. Also ordered some kushi oysters. All very good! The oysters were fresh and sweet. The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly and so tender. The fish and chips were also very good, one of the best I've had. The only complaint i had was the food took way too long. We waited 30 mins just for the calamari then 10 more mins for the fish and chips. I will definitely be back although i'd make sure i have extra time to spare.",1
trn_2609,"This could be by far the best place to get a massage at. I paid $80 for a deep tissue massage in May this year. I cant rememebr my therapists name, but she was amazing. Her hands were perfect. I've had a number of massages and let me tell you, after i left this place (with 3 of my gfs that also got massages), we all felt  AMAZING.",1
trn_2610,"I would give them one star but I gave them two stars only because the food is pretty good, but the lines and the parking make this place a pain to try and visit.  One time I drove all the way over there to get waved away,  the last time I got there plenty early and waited and waited for them to open and when they did the line still didn't move.  Sorry but only one cutting station and a couple hundred people in line is ridiculous. Waiting in line for that long isn't worth the time or aggravation.  Like I said the food is good but I don't feel it's worth putting up with the wait and parking.  I would try them again if they got a building that better meets the amount of people they serve, but until then I'm not going back.",-1
trn_2611,"We should have checked earlier for each day's specialties. Last Friday, we went here with a full gear prepared for crab-night, and then realized that we drove so far for no crab legs. However, service was still good as usual and the buffet wasn't crowded at the time. They have just updated a new station to prepare Shrimp Pasta on the spot and unlimited Prime Rib can make up for our disappointment. Be sure to check date and time for daily specialties before you arrive!!",1
trn_2612,"I'm a Colts fan...I love them, have been since i was 7 but ultimately, I am a football fan....and this stadium was built for its die-hard fans.  I can totally appreciate that.  Not only are there a shitload of seats, but MOST of them are not nose bleeds and the ones that are (I'm sure they are FREEZING this time of year) look to still have decent views of the field and screens.

My hubby is a big Pittsburgh Steeler fan, as his cousin plays for the team...so we headed out for the Colts vs. Steelers game in early november.  I have only been in a couple of NFL stadiums in my lifetime (one of them being my beloved RCA Dome) and I have to say, I was BLOWN away by the arena.  It was UNBELIEVABLE.  The seats are painted BRIGHT Steelers yellow that blinds you when you walk in.  And, if you are there for the opposing team (like I was), you DEFINTIELY stand out, b/c MAN, their fans come out in hordes swarming in every section, ready to bare down on an outsider.  It was awesome!!

Speaking of fans, despite me boasting blue and our team rockin' it out that day, they were REALLY cool to me.  I stood out like a sore thumb, being only one of maybe four Colts fans in my section so I was pretty exposed!  The guys sitting next to me gave me a hard time, insisted I swing their Terrible Towel and in general, were a lot of fun. :) I'm sure that not everyone was as nice, but I had great neighbors.

My seats were fantastic, in the lower section in the corner of the endzone.  I could see all the action!! It was great and I really enjoyed it.  It was REALLY cold but all in all, outside of seeing the Colts beat NE in the 2007 AFC Championship, this was by far the best NFL football experience I have ever had!  It was FANFREAKINTASTIC!!

If you ever have a chance to visit Heinz Field, TAKE advantage.  It was easily accessible, in a great location downtown, security was a breeze, fans rocked it out and the stadium is AWESOME!!",1
trn_2613,"I struggled with the rating on this one, but I really can't give it more than 2 Stars. 

Yes, as shown in other reviews, the portions are very small, the cup itself is very small, and even a full cup contains less than a medium DQ cone, for a MUCH higher price. 
Listen, I get it that they obviously need a high margin to keep a one-trick-pony store like this afloat, hire staff, pay the rent, but $7 for a banana and a handful of berries?
Still, IF the product was mind-blowingly good, then I could excuse the price, pay the extra, and enjoy the occasional yummy treat.
Sadly, the product is just okay.

I am an omnivore, but I cannot tell you how excited my vegan friend was that this place was right across the street from where I live, she could not wait to come visit and try the vegan softserve.
Between the two of us we purchased 2 double flavour cups so we could enjoy 4 different flavours and share, but sadly, even she had to admit that everything tasted fine, but only ""just fine"". The basic banana was the best, pistachio was disappointing, chocolate was bland and boring. Overall, unimpressed.
But her disappointment was disheartening. In the end, she decided she would continue making her own smoothies and soft serve with her Yonanas machine, in more fun flavours, all for under a buck for a much bigger serving.",-1

trn_2616,"Decent food, but a horrible ordering system that outweighs the decent food.

We ordered a variety of menu items. My husband had a Chorizo Breakfast Burrito and that was his favorite item we tried. The burrito was large and would be plenty of food on its own. I ordered a Chicken Taco, a Carnitas Taco, Mexican Corn, and a Chorizo Mula. We also shared Chips & Guacamole. The chicken taco was decent, the carnitas didn't have enough flavor, and I loved the chorizo mula. The meats overall weren't as well flavored as other tacos I've had. The Mexican corn was not as good as I expected and didn't have a ton of flavor. The chips and guacamole were great. I liked all of the salsas I tried from the salsa bar.

My pet peeve is when a restaurant can make good food, but can't run a business. Taco Y Taco is the epitome of this. Listen to your customers and do something to improve your ordering system. I've heard people comment that other taco spots in town have the same ordering system. Guess what? Just because something has always been done a certain way isn't a legitimate reason to continue doing it poorly. 

Here's how the ordering could be improved. Offer paper order sheets where customers mark what and how many items they want. Customers then hand the order form at the start of the cafeteria line and meet their order at the register at the end. Let the staff sort the separate meat areas in the back, stop making it the customer's problem.

The inside of the restaurant was a mess. I didn't see the staff clean a single table the entire time we were dining. It was fend for yourself at the least dirty table you could find. Silverware, condiments, and napkins are located on top of the trash cans next to dirty trays and whatever else people leave on top of the trash can. This needs to be moved to its own sanitary location.

It took us four years to give this spot a second try and it'll probably be at least that long before we visit again.",-1
trn_2617,"We have been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally went Saturday evening.  We sat on the patio and had some delicious cocktails.  We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.  Well done Trey!  Thank you!",1

The décor at Claim Jumper is big and rustic, but cozy, evocative of a Yukon lumber mill.  Given the name, that can't be a surprise, right?  

The food portions are generously sized to match.  Think food for lumberjacks; delicious, hearty, meaty food for lumberjacks.  

Do you have a lumber-sexual in your life?  Bring him here.  Feed him man sized hunks of meat and mighty forkfuls of mashed potatoes, all washed down with beer.

I will say what is easy to one person may be challenging to another person as there are plenty of peaks on this trail head. I love the view from the top! I was pleasantly surprised that the trail was so well maintained and easy to walk, with consideration it's mostly rock. The weather today was mild and perfect for climb. 

The parking around the trail was ample and very open with close proximity to start of multiple access points. I did also use the bathrooms which were clean and accessible before you start your hike. I counted 6 stalls with hand washing station outside of bathrooms. 

Across from the bathrooms there was signage of history of trail with maps for different access points. I would highly recommend this trail with WATER to carry along with you.

trn_2630,"If you have a craving for some Chinese food, come here. I like this place because it's one of the few Chinese restaurants on the strip that comes kind of close to tasting like it. And the price is reasonable considering where it is. Everytime I come here( I go to vegas 2 to 3 times a year), I've always had fast service. Of course it won't be as good as the restautants in the SF Bay Area though.

I know they have some other 'non-Chinese' things here like sake but they have mostly Chinese dishes. This is what I ordered the last time I was there: 
Hot and Sour Soup(kind of spicy but I like spicy)
Red Won Tons(kind of plain but not bad)
Spicy Beef Tripe(this was good although I wish it warm, didn't know it was a cold dish)
Si Jiu Beef(this was good)",1
trn_2631,"Spicy Tuna Hand Roll. bam.
Sea Bass. Bam.
Creme Brulee. BAM.

Best buffet I've tried in Vegas (I was able to hit up 3 others during the trip). Yup, we have us a winner, and I'd be back again and again. Everything else I had was good- not spectacular like the 3 items mentioned above but still very good. 
Service was also surprisingly good for a buffet. All of our drinks came out in a timely manner, and their Pear Martini is schoo nomz. 
Tip: If you have a large group (we had 25), swing by a few hours ahead of time and pre-pay so that you can skip the line when you're ready to eat. Otherwise, be prepared to wait- especially around dinner time. 

It's a shame though that I stuffed myself silly with food, martinis, and champagne...the proceeded to sit backwards in a limo where the driver didn't understand the concept of slowly accelerating and slowly braking, got carsick, and yacked everything up by the time I made it back to the hotel.

  The great thing about Kyle Fletcher's is they have world famous hamburgers as well!!! They are to die for, no lie!!! The place has very affordable prices and a pound of BBQ is just like 7.99. The only thing I don't like is they have no family pack deals. You have to buy everything sepertately.",1

The rest of the staff was polite, and I don't know how they found out it was my birthday but I had a gift bag at the front desk waiting for me!

One of the employees gave me a tour, and a plastic container and let me sample ANYTHING I wanted to try. I was in there eating olives, different salads, granolas, and other yummy treats. You don't have to be rich to shop here. I do my regular grocery shopping at Walmart, then buy my foods for breakfast, and lunch here at Whole Foods. That includes bran muffins, various premade salads, a few sweet treats, and granolas. These healthy selections last me atleast 5 working days. 
Weekly I spend $25-$30 for a single female. I asked a male friend what he spends and he said $50-$60 because he buys meats. You can't put a price on health, so even if you don't grocery shop here it doesn't hurt to mix in a few vitamins and minerals with fresh fruits and veggies on regular basis.

trn_2644,"If you're looking for a good deal for breakfast on the Strip, then the Bellagio is the way to go. Monday through Friday the buffet is only $17 for breakfast. It's a big nice buffet and if you come before 11 you can get the breakfast price and try some of the lunch food as well.

I thought the buffet here was pretty good. This isn't the nicest buffet I've been to which is surprising since it's the Bellagio. However, the food is good. They have all your standard breakfast foods: bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, waffles, oatmeal. They even have some lox and bagels, toast and spreads, and a design an omelet station.

I thought the selection was a little limited. The eggs were runny and pretty gross. They were also clearly powdered eggs. The bacon was good and abundant. I also got pickled herring which was a nice treat.

The line wasn't too long to get in. I bet I waited about 10 minutes which is excellent for a buffet.

I also must mention that this place serves the BEST coffee I've ever had in a restaurant. It was amazingly good. I want more right now.

trn_2645,"We dropped by in hopes of finding Atkinson's Peanut Butter Bars(we first tried them From Honey Salt's candy bowl ) and after searching a few minutes, we found it. 

I was also bummed that stores didn't carry Peanut Butter Twix anymore, but now I'm happy that they can also be found at Rocket Fizz.. On our way out, wifey grabbed an RC Cola and I tried a Key Lime Pie soda which was pretty good.

If you're searching for a candy or soda pop you grew up with and can no longer find, there's a good chance you'll find it here. If only Now and Later would bring back their bubble gum flavored taffy, and If Tidal Wave Gum came back to life...The Green Apple was my favorite!......ALOHA!!!

trn_2646,"TLDR: great family shop for a quick bite or for a meal to take out. well loved by Kensington locals

i work in Kensington and eat here very often. if you need a quick slice and pop for 5 bucks this is the spot. if you have time try one of their italian sandwiches they are huge and well worth the price. very tasty and the family that runs it are among the nicest you'll meet in kenzo. dont be surprised if you get the boss one day, his lovely wife the next or one of their young but very courteous kids running the shop the next. its a trip seeing a 12 year old command a busy quick stop resto so well haha",1
trn_2647,This place is a joke. I was absolutely disgusted with their service and their inability to paint nails correctly. She used 5 coats then immediately used the fast drying polish which then smudged my polish. She walked away while they were drying and didn't have the decency to see the disgusting finished product.,-1
trn_2648,"This is such a nice bakery on Port union road, and has the best no fuss coffee. ( To me). They re donuts are nothing like anything you get at a Timmys, starbucks, country style, anywhere but a small bakery that makes they re own donuts. They re a bit crispy, even the yeast donuts, but not stale, Ive never had a stale donut from this place. They re a good size, and they re cheap.  .  Now they re coffee, its just really good simple coffee!. I have no idea if its fair trade or any of that and really I dont care, its always fresh, and never burnt tasting. I cant go on about coffee because I dont know all the fancy lingo people used to describe it, but its GOOD!.",1
trn_2649,"I am checking this place out for the first. First impression, I came in the at the slow part of the day yet the staff was very attentive. I was quickly sat, promptly took my order. I ordered the spring roll and  Tai (Rare beef with Noods) add vegetables (the only think that was missed) I kind of like that the veggies didn't show, more broth .... really well made broth not to salty but with great density and flavor. My water cup was never lower than half way and the place was clean and smelled fantastic. I would give the 5th star had the bowls been a little bigger and the veggies hadn't been missed.",1
trn_2650,Lisa was so wonderful with my cat Lucy. I found them through yelp and am so glad I did. I think Lucy was a bit disappointed to se me walk up the stairs after vacation they were so wonderful with her lol! You will feel so comfortable trusting your fur kids to them.,1
trn_2651,"As I write this, visions of Sicilian cannoli dance in my eyes. It's the perfect treat, whether enjoyed solo or with a warm beverage. But I also need to wax poetic about the masterpiece that is their Toasted Almond Apple Tart, which I purchased for a dinner party at the ridiculously reasonable price of $18.99. A thing of beauty to begin with. Moreover, Just. So. Good. Warmed up with some vanilla ice cream on the side. Cant wait to return to try some of their other delectable offerings.",1

trn_2654,"Probably the largest Asian grocery store in the area:  They have a huge supply of ramen (no, not maruchan *shakes fist*) and ingredients.  Though not as produce-centric as Far East, they have much more in terms of sauces, frozen food, and even cooking untensils.

Don't miss out on grabbing some cuttle fish chips, crushed pear juice, and some frozen man doo, among the many things you can find here, but nowhere else.",1
trn_2655,"Guys I'm so confused. So confused. I like to think I'm a hip person who frequents gallery crawls and drinks red wine and decorates my house with tons of plants, but this was truly the most millennial thing I've ever done. And I thought I was super millennial. 

You walk in, are fronted with a huge wall menu, place your order, and sit. Anyone who has ever been to Gaucho (which def isn't Vegan) it's a very similar set up. That's cool I don't mind that. I've also have vegan food from other vegan restaurants and really enjoyed it (no I'm not vegan). 

We sat in the back room which I didn't realize was like a garage area till after, when I started to freeze. It was so cold in there. I did enjoy the vibe and happiness around and ambience with the lighting. 

The food: I ordered the pierogies and the potato pancakes. The potato pancakes were ok, but they were cold. Maybe they were supposed to be? The pierogies were good but I'm sorry I really don't think they're as amazing as everyone says they are. I liked the sauces and relishes with the dishes more than the actual dish. 

Maybe I'll be back? I kinda want this 5 star restaurant that everyone else is saying it is.",0
trn_2656,Lots of plug-ins for people looking to sit down and work. Amazing drinks no matter what you get. Great central area with lots of traffic coming in and out but still seems to be a generally quieter place in regards to noise which is nice. Had a couple of their pastries from time to time as well and would always want to go back for seconds!,1
trn_2657,Im only giving this place one star because i have to not because i want to if it were up to me i would not give them any. I went in with my dog boo which was diagnosed with parvo it was the first day my dog was acting up and i took her to the doctor right away the vet told me there was 9/10 chances she'd survive since i took her so early. they told me the estimate would be about 1000 dollars for the treatment and my dog would only have to stay for 7 days if anything. They told me they would keep me posted but they didnt i called them and they said they would call me back but they didnt call me till 8:30 pm! I had left my dog there at 10 am! My dog passed that same night at about 9:20 pm They are currently charging me 539 $ when my dog was only there for only 11 hours. Theyre terrible take your dog elsewhere.,-1
trn_2658,"The food is usually very good and made fresh from scratch. That being said, they don't list ingredients very thoroughly on their menu, which is surprising for a supposedly allergy friendly restaurant. It takes a long time to get your food, so if it has to be remade, you're in for a long wait. However, I do like their food and their pastries are tasty, as well.",0
trn_2659,Its like a small grocery shop with shawrma section on the side. They give huge portion of meat for their shwarmas. Their small is medium elsewhere. Good shwarma . Worth a visit!,1
trn_2660,Lovely square with free wi-fi and lots of musical concerts! Today they were launching some kind of news channel and giving away free sunglasses - they were pretty cool by the way. It is located very close to a Yonge subway and not very crowed during summer time - to my surprise.,1
trn_2661,"The cookies I have had here were delicious and huge!  Haven't actually been in the shop yet, but tried the snickerdoodle and chocolate chip and both were great.",1
trn_2662,"Honestly some of the best service I've ever had! So welcoming and genuine. I ordered an iced latte which was very good and an opera cake which was good while not too sweet. The cake was a bit like a pastry spin on a tiramisu. Very cute shop with great service, you should stop by if in the area!",1
trn_2663,My favorite breakfast place in the entire world (and i am a New Yorker who has been to many breakfast places). The eggs are amazing but the hash browns and toast are incredible. The toast is the best toast i have ever had in my life and i wish i could eat it every day!!!,1

trn_2665,"WooHoo, why wasn't this place here when I lived on Langtree.

I came out to watch some college basketball and it happened to be a Primal Brewery takeover night.  A rowdy but respectful full crowd, lots of other beers on tap, and plenty of tv's.  There were even some games in the back such as shuffleboard and darts.

I ended up meeting a lot of cool people that night just sitting on the front patio.  I even met a few employees and they were all super nice and helpful.  Shae and T.C. especially.  I guess they were off, but still willing to show me around and such.

All in a great bar that apparently is a barber shop as well.  I'll be back if in the area.  Supposedly they even offer shuttles there and back to other location.",1
trn_2666,i bring my altima here because they dont bs too much just do what you tell them and im in and out in about 30 min and also get a free car wash. For about $30 you dont have to deal with all the stupid stuff like at a jiffy lube when they try to act like they are true mechanics. also if you stay loyal here they give a $3 discount everytime you do your oil change here.,1
trn_2667,"But since we have new management Tay is the best that has ever happened here. She's very accommodating and tries to everything to help out your situation unlike the past in my experience. There's plenty of parking, very quiet neighbors, beautiful scenery even though your very close to 51 885 and 43 you don't hear a thing. What I love about this place is that there's trails for you to go on with your dogs that they have no weight limit which is a big plus for me since I have a Newfoundland. The staff there is absolutely wonderful. Ed who is maintenance adores my pooches and says hi to me all the time. They come immediately for everything. The downside though for me right now is the air conditioning unit. It's not powerful enough to cool down enough on the 3 bedroom. But I was rest assured that TAY is handling it. She handles issues right there and then even if it's little. The pool hours are great there open late so when you have to work you don't have to miss out. Also the fact that the gym is open 24 hrs is wonderful you can go at 330 in the morning if you wanted to. We're moving down to a two bedroom and we did have confusion but tay and corporate worked with us accordingly. In my opinion they definitely stepped up there game since last year that's also including ed and bill who are the maintenance. If you would to ask me to review this place a year ago I would say the management there sucked. I love the fact that it's kinda a country suburban style to it but your still kinda close to the city without all the noise.  I love it here I don't plan on moving anytime soon",1
trn_2668,"My friends and I came here for the champagne brunch on a Saturday. The line was pretty long, but once we finally got in, we ate and drank our moneys worth! The champagne was unlimited, and we stayed from 12:30pm-4:30pm... the longest I've ever stayed at a buffet! But I'm glad we got to try out both the brunch and dinner food! The dinner food is especially excellent. 

Our service was outstanding, because they made sure our champagne glasses were always full and came back often to see if we were okay.

I will definitely be coming back here for dinner... or maybe pull another double meal.",1

trn_2670,I had major grease stains and odor from a food spilled in my backseat and I messaged for a quote the same night. I got quoted for $135 for interior detailing and an additional $25 for a basic interior wash. I booked an appointment through text which was super convenient. I booked it for two days later on Sunday and they even offered to do it sooner but I wasn't available. Sunday morning I received texts to update me on their arrival. Once they arrived they were super professional and they gave me a overview of what would be done after I showed them my areas of concerns. An hour later the stain was out and my truck looked the best it ever had inside and out.,1
trn_2671,"This dessert place is very lovely :), I would give more stars if I could! The menu is pretty versatile, though it is the typical dessert selection you can find almost anywhere (but I didn't come here for something new anyways haha). I had the Nutella and banana crepe and it was delicious and very nicely designed. I like that Pastel puts in effort to make their dishes look good. Atmosphere and service is good. Next time I go, I will try out their specialty cakes and lattes!",1
trn_2672,"One of my favorite places in Vegas. Service is always great, food is always delicious, and nice ambiance. Love the decor. A couple favorites: the chicken sandwich for brunch, the scallops for dinner. Love the desserts - particularly bread pudding or brookie.",1
trn_2673,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the US. I really wasn't expecting the opulence of the interior, so my senses were a little overwhelmed. I got there about 10 minutes before they opened, so as I sat in the car waiting I got to watch the throng of staff as they filtered in. I've never seen that large a number of staff at a restaurant in my entire life. 

As many have said, the menu is way too extensive and the pages of advertising are off-putting. I was greeted almost immediately by a lead waiter and a young man that he was training. Both were very attentive. They both did something I personally find a little annoying, which was to say something like ""excellent choice"" upon my selection of items. My self-esteem is fine, I really don't need my ego massaged. 

I ordered the lunch pepperoni pizza with side salad, and both were good. I followed that with the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, and it would be worth the 52-mile round trip just to have that again. 

The cost for the lunch, including a 20% tip, was $27. As a retired teacher, I find that very pricey, but it was still a good experience. I'd definitely reserve this for only special occasions due to the price.",1
trn_2674,"Has always been one of my weekly stops on my grocery tour. I'm usually a produce and fresh food type of person, so the selection and quality is great. Usually pricier than other markets in the area, but still great. The do have a nice international section which is always nice for when a burger just isn't on the menu for the night.",1
trn_2675,"This place is great, I have now had 4 treatments at this location and each experience has been professional, quick, and the gals are extremely friendly and attentive. I was initially hesitant about the price considering it's such a huge expense, but thus far I am very pleased with my progress. I would definitely attribute this to the lasers used at this location. I have heard horror stories about others receiving multiple treatments with no progress and this is not my experience with invisible ink.",1
trn_2676,"I think boondocks  has a great concept it just fails on execution.  Since it is still relatively new I'm not going to be overly critical, because overall it was a good experience. 

Service: 4 stars - the server was very sweet and attentive. There were a lot of people working on a Thursday night but she still managed to make sure that we had everything we needed. 

Food: 3 stars- the menu was very intriguing it had a lot of unique options for a bar. Unfortunately when they came out while they looked pretty they lacked in flavor. It was like they just missed the mark on everything. 

Atmosphere: I think it's great that they covered up the pool from Spanish fly and opened up the area so it could be a more fun environment, with ping-pong and other games.  The problem is they really didn't update anything else. The bathrooms are still old and dingy and weren't very well-kept. 

Overall, I would compare this to a Gilligans... Kind of divey but a good place to go when you want to have a casual drink and hang out with friends.",0
trn_2677,"Talk about fresh fish! I vacationed in Las Vegas with some friends and we stumbled upon this place while shopping. Everything was perfect. We got an assortment of nigiri, sashimi, and some rolls and we were amazed at how delicious everything was! Especially the fish! The service was spot on and couldn't ask for more. She kept our drinks filled, answered any questions we had (and we had a bunch) and took great care of us throughout our meal. The ambiance was outstanding. It was dark and somewhat romantic. The interior is phenomenal and so well done. If you want fresh fish, great service, and awesome atmosphere this is the place to go!",1

trn_2680,"The restaurant is sparkling with nice furniture and a definitely eye catchy bar. The moment you step inside, it does appeal you giving you a sense of cleanliness and luxury. Once you are seated in your table, you get this cramped feeling - obviously the restaurant is a bit smaller and has packed more tables than it should. You are provided with bread and oregano as a free appetizer. Not very appetizing, would have loved if they had hummus instead. The menu gives you a variety of Mediterranean options with some sandwich options that may be for the not so adventurous patrons. The options are indeed fun with a twist. The Arrarat cutlet gets a definite vote of innovation from me - a chicken hot pocket packed with spinach and mushrooms! The food came in with an extra delay than you would normally wait for. I could relate the delay with the 'now hiring' sign posted on the outside door. The food wasn't so bad - but it didn't really seem like a carefully orchestrated menu. You can order three sides from hummus, veg Salad, rice, French fries or mashed potatoes. Except for veg salad and rice, I found it rather difficult accompanies to meat. Are you supposed to choke down on the hummus or mashed potatoes? The French fries are not your regular American fries - I found them rather larger chunks of unappetizing steamed or baked potatoes. For a cuisine known for their meats, found that their chicken or lamb was not succulent and juice. They were much more hard and rubbery, it does definitely become a struggle point of your meal. The portions are good but it's on the pricey side - about 35-40$ for two with just entrees.

Summing up Arrarat definitely tries to set itself apart from other Mediterranean restaurants by giving a great ambience and styling, with an innovative menu. With all that well done, the food is not top of its class.",0
trn_2681,"Not at all impressed. Seated close to the door in a mostly empty restaurant. Subjected to blasts of cold air every time the door opened. Mentioned to server, did not seem to care. Ordered eggs Benedict it came with some greyish turkey flavored gravy. Told server. She chose to argue with me rather than make it right. No offer of something new, no discount for the inedible meal. No chance of me coming back. Terrible all the way around.",-1

At the top of our list of must have's are the Grilled Skirt Steak and their Shrimp entree (don't remember the name). The steak is cooked to perfection and the shrimp are always tender, never over cooked or over spiced. If you are like me too much salt is a bad thing. The Chef will not add salt to your dish if you ask. No problems there.

The three sample salsa & chip dish they give you is the best. The guacamole is also a must have. Always fresh and tasty.",1

The brushetta was to die for and the stuffed grape leaves were delicious.  We had the gyro platter which consisted of beef and lamb carved off the shank and Mousaka which was an egg plant and potato dish that melted in your mouth!  It is a lively place and they had a nice bar.  The waiters were wonderful too.  You'll like this place so check it out.,1

Cover for yesterday's event was supposedly $35 for girls and for our guys, they were all charged $100.  No Joke!  The later you go, then your cover might be reduced to $50.  I feel so bad for guys!

Once again, major perks to be a girl!! FREEEEEE for us!! We bypassed the line with ease and got into the club within minutes.

This place is beautiful and glamorous.  I love the bright orange,red,yellow colors that Mr. Wynn designed with.  2 stories full of Cabanas and day beds available.  Some cabanas come with a back view.  If you aren't splurging on these bad boys, have no fear!  You can sit along the side of the pool! Drinks here are around $15 and up.  For some reason, Wet Republic's drinks were more worth it. (alcohol content-wise). I had several of their drinks, and some of them tasted like no alcohol was mixed in.  The Strawberry margarita,  margarita on the rocks, and watermelon drinks, which were tasty and refreshing.  The vibe here is definitely different from Wet Republic.  It is more chill but at the same time a good relaxing time.  All you keep doing is looking at all these hot bodies passing by you.  It's ridiculous! One girl sprained her ankle and had it wrapped but still pushed herself to wear heels!! The things people do to look hot for one day!

The grill, for quick food, is available at the end of the club.  Spacious bars were available.  The service is quick and enjoyable.  

All I gotta say is Kaskade was AMAZING!  My first time seeing him live and for free!!  He is so passionate into his music.  How can I not have fun especially how we managed to be front row to him through that massive crowd! Unce Unce Unce Unce!

PS: Time to work out for next season!",1

The last time we visited our waiter gave us such great recommendations and really explained the wine that we got (free with a check-in). It's fantastic!

Starting out with the chips, they do it right. Nicely salted to a point where you will always ask for another basket. The people were great, welcoming and happy.

trn_2694,"Honestly the food is a bit overrated. When you compare the burgers and food to Duckworth's it's not that great. The sides seem very quickly put together and not very well seasoned. Some burgers are average while the others lack in sauce, flavor, or soggy. I've tried this place multiple times and each time feel a bit disappointed because I'm hoping it will be better. Like I said, it's pretty average. If you're looking for late night quick food, this is your place. Something that's not delicious but will get you fed.",0

But alas, no chocolate in the case. We settled on the lemon lavender cake (which I'm sure was yummy) and ordered a couple of lattes, but happened to ask the guy behind the counter if by some chance they might have anything chocolate in the back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and a lovely woman came out and said she'd heard we wanted some chocolate and said, ""We take our chocolate very seriously here."" -- then told us she was going to make us a special treat and asked whether we preferred light or dark chocolate (definitely dark). Wow. Impressive.

About 15 minutes later, she came out with a beautiful tart made with shortbread crust and a dark chocolate ganache filling, topped with pecans and caramel sauce. Gorgeous presentation, and the taste was beyond heaven -- literally the best dessert I've ever had. The still-warm ganache was deep, dark, soul-satisfying CHOCOLATE. Oh Lordy, we were in hog heaven. We polished that baby off, finished our lattes, and made a speedy and contented trip back to Tucson.

We split a strawberry and fig dinner salad and the chimichanga - both were also delicious. The one thing I didn't really love was dessert (lemon cheesecake), but otherwise everything was tremendous.

trn_2707,I went here with a friend Sunday night and they had $4.00 margaritas! That's a plus! We had already eaten dinner somewhere else but the margarita was tasty. And they checked on us but not to a point of bothersome. I'd go back. ;),1
trn_2708,"Hotels used to have lavish lunch buffets with some sort of meat.  Nowadays $12 will get you an all you can eat soup and salad bar.  Luckily Colors Bistro still offers one other hot item (usually a pasta).

I miss the old days when this bistro would make endless refills of custom pasta dishes PLUS the salad bar, which we all know is really a concession prize for the good stuff.

The food is good, quality is OK and service is excellent here.  I'd probably try the menu items which might be a better value than the salad bar.",0
trn_2709,"Yesterday I came to this location for the first time and ordered the crispy club salad for lunch. It was so good that I got another one for dinner, and am now back again today for my third. Delicious! The location is clean and nicely decorated. Yes, there were teens staffing the location last night, but I don't see this as an issue (unlike some other reviewers). It's not fine dining, folks, so stop expecting it to be. I'll keep coming back for sure!",1

trn_2711,"Good service, food was mediocre. The pita bread seemed to be old and smelled funky. Wouldn't go back to eat there again. There are plenty of places around the area and would try something new. Saint Alexandre has plenty, just don't go here.",-1
trn_2712,"Livingstone & Cavell Extraordinary Toys... Well, the name says it all; this store is extraordinary!   It's the kind of place that stirs child like wonder in you before you even pass through the door. 

I parked outside to go to the coffee shop next door, but the front window and beautiful antique sign just called to me to go in and, well, play! And play I did. I saw toys from my childhood that I had completely forgotten about. Found new amazing toys as well. But perhaps the most extraordinary are the many, many hand carved wooden toys and the vintage tin ones as well. I can't tell you how absolutely astonishing this store is - it is a place of sheer joy, filled with happiness that is sure to spread to whomever is lucky enough to receive a gift from you when you shop here. 

So what are you still reading this for, hurry up, and go see for yourself!",1
trn_2713,"Good food, great ambiance, good location. Visited this place 4/1/15 around 7pm. Went on a Travel zoo voucher and the staff didn't give us any trouble with using the voucher.Restaurant wasn't busy at all. Waiter was very attentive and the food came out remarkably fast.

The food:
-Starter: Foo platter. It was ok. Pretty standard wings, egg rolls, dumplings and chips. I will say the egg rolls were AMAZING! 

-Drinks: I had the Crouching Tiger which was pretty good. Must be a whiskey fan to enjoy this drink. My friend had the Rising Sun (I think) it was really good. Very light and slightly fruity.

-Short rib ramen: was pretty good. The broth is the star on this one. If you're a ramen fan I recommend giving this a try.

-Pork belly ramen: From what my friend said, this was pretty good as well

Overall I recommend this place to check out if you're in the area. It seems like a great place to go for a happy hour hang out as there's a really nice patio area and delicious drinks.",1
trn_2714,"Service was awesome and very friendly. They gave us free garlic knots! I liked the ordering set up, being able to choose your toppings and type of sauce. I just thought their pizza was so so... Nothing worth writing about... Maybe I need to try it again, but I don't see myself craving the pizza anytime soon.",0
trn_2715,Went in on wed night and everything was great. We got seated right away. Being from Montreal we always find Toronto restos lack some quality food but it was not the case for this resto. They have some decent beers on tap on top of wine list . Would def go back.,1

trn_2717,"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 24/100***

We have been to Famous Dave's several times and I've always enjoyed their food. It's far from being the best BBQ but certainly not the worst either. Our last visit prior to yesterdays lunch was last September. My husband swears their burnt end appetizer is half the portion size they were before. Honestly, I don't remember but it certainly wasn't up to par to the $8.99 price tag. We usually order their BBQ feast that comes with a little bit of everything: Ribs, Brisket, Chicken, fries, coleslaw, corn, beans, and corn bread. It's plenty of food for 3 people to share. Normally I really enjoy the ribs and brisket but this past visit the brisket was really dry and unappetizing. The flavor was there but it sorely lacked the moisture and juices. The ribs and everything else were good though so I enjoyed that. The banana pudding is huge and definitely satiates.",0
trn_2718,"I saw the place had a 5 star rating, and I am happy for those that love it!... but it was very average to me, less than average really. I personally, didn't find it tasty, or well-priced. In general I do not understand the concept of infinite flavors of popcorn I guess! Some things are awesome! Like Reese's - Reese's cannot be improved by adding very dry popcorn. That being said... even classic popcorn flavors were of lack-luster quality, taste and freshness IMHO. The employee was not noteworthy in any way (in the way of helpfulness or friendliness). That being said... if you want to try insane flavors of popcorn you have never tried then by all means??? The flavors were inventive, leaving the opportunity to try food in a flavor/texture combination you haven't tried before! And kids would probably love it! So hopefully you will try and enjoy it as much as every. single. other. reviewer! But just note that you might feel as I did.",-1
trn_2719,"Came here for lunch with a large group from work and was very disappointed with the service and generally unimpressed by the food. We had reservations for 10 and were seated in the back room.  While this was a quieter area of the restaurant it also meant we were easily and often ignored by the wait staff). As we were perusing the menus another group was seated in the same room. 

Strike 1: Only the lunch specials menu was on the table so my colleague had to go to the front and grab a stack of menus for our group since the waiter was no where to be found. 

Strike 2: The adjacent table was served their main courses before we were (even though they were seated after us) and our meals came out very slowly and incorrectly (Brought out the wrong lunch combo for my colleague)

Strike 3: Another colleague's meal was cold (this is after waiting an hour for our food) and as she was eating the replacement, discovered a tempura sweet potato with a bite taken out of it! It was stacked underneath the other tempura items which would indicate that it wasn't eaten by her. 

Sufficed to say we were all pretty unhappy with the place and felt slightly ill from the whole experience. 

Lesson learned! Never again!",-1
trn_2720,"First things first. This place has some of the best tacos ever. Generally fast service. Amazing heat. Chopped to order meat. Even a gringo menu for those less adventurous. Overall it's a great meal and reasonably priced. 

That out of the way, what the actual feck is going on with the bar and the cashiers? Every time I order a beer the ladies at the register look like I'm speaking Mandarin. They ask the bartender. They never key in the right thing. It's a mess. Tonight I read the name of a beer off of the ""todays drafts"" list and the bartender looked like I asked for his dead puppy. They didn't have that beer. That was listed on the list of today's beers. 

I really love the food here. It's seriously a place I bring every visitor. This is my taco happy place. But y'all need to get your stuff together on the cash register and bar side. Make the overall experience as good as the food.",1

Only drawbacks are the whole ""you have to enter the room and insert your hotel key to start the AC"" thing.  Those rooms are effing hot when you first come in and it takes forever to get them cool.  Also, the fitness center is pretty underwhelming.",1

trn_2726,"First time going to a drive in theatre and I was super excited. The experience of watching a movie under the stars is really cool...especially if you have a portable radio and lawn chair set up outside the car with some nice cool weather. This theatre has a snack bar and some washrooms in the back. The screen was very big. We reversed in and watched from our trunk. We were able to listen in to the radio signal with our portable radio. We opted to not leave our car on idle for the radio as we were worried about battery issues. A couple of people's cars were drained out of battery and they had to call CAA for a boost.

Snack bar food:
- prices were reasonable, significantly cheaper than cineplex's snack combos
- funnel cake with vanilla ice cream and some strawberry sauce is so goddamn good. I must get this every time I come to this drive in movie theatre
- french fries were fresh/made to order and sooo good!!! chicken fingers with fries is put into a surprisingly large take out box. (took a good 15 minutes to come out during credits of movie 1)
- chili fries also very good, but took forever to come out of the kitchen (30 minute wait before the movie started)
- cheese sauce that came with the nachoes were sooo salty (saltier than cineplex's).

Issues with the snack bar/washrooms:
- snack bar looked very dirty and old/not maintained in a sanitary condition
- no one wore hair nets/hats/caps to catch hair
- some of the kitchen staff did not look clean, clothes looked unhygienic (raggedy white shirts covered in dirt/dust)
- about 2 washroom stalls in the women's side did not have working locks (therefore not useable)
- most of the toilets were filthy, clogged, not cleaned during the movies
- only 2 handwash sinks were functional",0

Ordered sweet & sour chicken for carry out.
Got it home and honestly, I've gotten bigger chicken nuggets at McDonalds. The portion was also nothing to write home about.

trn_2731,"I stayed at the Bellagio for my brother's wedding/the Rock n Roll Vegas Half Marathon, so I got free vouchers for the buffet. After the race and the next morning, I treated myself to the buffet.

Dinner buffet: Really disappointing. I had just run 13.1 miles, so I was ready to inhale every bite of food. But as I walked around, everything just seemed...blah. I forced myself to eat different pastas, pizzas, and meats, and it was all just very basic. The one shining part was the tomato soup - I had several bowls of this, and I wish I had more right now.

Breakfast buffet: Much better than the dinner one, but still not the best. I loved all of the different potato varieties, and the bar service was very nice and fast with my coffee order. 

I've heard so many amazing things about Vegas buffets, and especially the Bellagio one, but it just seemed very generic to me. I would have been upset if I didn't have the free vouchers from staying at the hotel.",-1

I grabbed a nice warm americano, a delcious cookie, a seat by the window, and got knee deep in a good book. The place was about 80% full and exactly what I needed that night. 

I read that this place does speciality themed nights such as vegan and vegetarian dinners, plus they have live music. Both of these ideas sound very interesting to me so I can't wait to try them out!

There is literally nothing to complain about at Higher Ground. It's like a sancturary of peace! Actually ok, only one complaint...the bathroom was a tad... icky... but I looked past it!",1

trn_2737,"NEW CHEF!

We had been visitors before the remodel some years back and never made a visit to the remodeled El Chorro. While I miss the funky décor of old Scottsdale, I like the updated version also! 

We visited on a very chilly night and after a drink at the bar, my husband suggested we have our early dinner outside on the patio under all the heaters. I scoffed. It's really cold. The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.

Our server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy! Only complaint was that our wedge salad (which Andre had divided into two for us) had too much dressing on it.
Second complaint was that the food was so good, I overate. My pooch is sticking out as I write.

In our conversation, Andre mentioned that there was a new chef in the kitchen when we said how great our food was. Strongly recommend El Chorro.",1
trn_2738,This is a wonderful place to get a healthy drink! Everything on the menu is delicious. I can even get my kids to finally start taking in vegetables  and fruits.

However, the last 2-3 times I've been there I've been very disappointed. There seems to have been lots of staff changes and they just don't take the same care they used to. Also, the selection and quality of polish isn't good (they never have updated colors) and the staff just isn't as friendly as they used to be. I splurge a few times a year on a manicure and pedicure but today's was about the same quality I could have given myself--combined with grumpy nail technicians. Disappointed and won't go back!",-1

The owners went out of their way to make it a magical experience- they even brought out their ADORABLE dog. Needless to say, I will never forget the hospitality they showed us and all the effort they put in to celebrating with my friends and me.

All of the fresh water flowing everywhere, guns everywhere, camping gear galore, camouflage equipment and fishing gear is enough to make any man go insane.  Only reason this was not a five star review is because the prices were about 10-20% higher than other retailers.

When considering buying a gun here I dealt with Matt who was extremely helpful and very informative.  Although I didn't make a purchase here, I would definitely come back based on how helpful all of the employees were.  Bass Pro Shops also leads right into the Silverton Casino.  Should definitely check it out even if you're a local just for the scenery.",1

I ordered the Sundried Tomato Pesto ($14.95) which is Fusilli Pasta with cubed tender and juicy chicken breast, sautéed mushrooms, broccoli, onions, sundried tomato, and a drizzle of walnut-pesto cream sauce. Also I ordered a side of French Fries ($4.25) which were well-done, hot and crispy, and I was happy it was delivered along side with my meal. I noticed a major improvement with the food quality. The flavor of the pasta is delicious with that walnut-pesto cream sauce. And I do enjoy their consistent, friendly, and attentive service. Overall, my meal is very filling and satisfying and the people who work here are wonderful. I wouldn't mind coming back to dine in. At Lazy Dog, there is no need for formality.

I mean we were very impressed with our service and are soo eager to return to try more of the menu. We have the house sausage sandwich and Korean burger.

Instead of mailing my deposit to me after I moved out, they gave over $250 to a roommate whose name is not on the lease. After being a responsible tenant, they gave away MY money. Phone calls are rarely if ever returned here, and I feel they are dishonest and dismissive with anything involving money. Policies and answers are not consistent. I was told 3 separate times that they would mail my check to me only to find that they had given it to another person. They took no responsibility and basically told me it was my problem. Not worth all the headaches and dishonesty.",-1

Staff was very friendly & accommodating. They're definitely renovating at the moment but hey can't be mad at it. Some of the furniture is a little worn down but the room was very clean itself. I think that the people who rated this place low are probably picky & are bothered by small things. I did find somethings I could complain about but it honestly wasn't a big deal. I wouldn't really recommend families this is more of a spot you go to with friends.,1

i had the beef kabobs and it was yummy! if you check in, they give you 1 dollar off so thats good. however if you wanted some sour cream, they charge you 75 cents each so basically with the dollar you save, you give it back for the sauce. lol either way this place is good.",1
trn_2754,"Originally planned to go here for brunch but the lineup was so long we had brunch somewhere else and came back later for red velvet pancakes as dessert. We did appreciate the wait list text so we could stroll around somewhere else while waiting. 

When we got the text that a table was available we were already full from brunch somewhere else, but we wanted to try the red velvet pancakes so we went with full stomachs. 

The service was friendly, but spread thin as the place was packed and bursting at the seams.


We ordered a regular size of the red velvet pancakes to share. When it came we were astounded by how large the portions were. We instantly regretted not getting the side version. But the pancakes were amazing. Exactly what I want red velvet to taste like. The chocolate flavour and aroma was rich, but not grossly overwhelming the senses. They were fluffy with a good amount of dense. The cream cheese icing was my favourite part. Rich and full of flavour without being numbingly sweet. The sweetness came from the syrup you pour over yourself which was nice because my bf likes a lot while I like just a hint of sweetness. 

Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the food was not disappointing. I could appreciate that even though I was full from brunch somewhere else, the pancakes were still delicious and the menu was appealing. Definitely want to go back and try other items on the menu esp the salad bowls.",1

This is probably one of the most amazing gyms I have been a member at. I have not been living in Vegas for too long so we all know how finding a new gym once you move is not always so fun. 

The manager at this gym was AMAZING he never pressured me to sign up gave me a two week pass so that I could try it out and I can tell you it only took a few days for me to relize that I loved this gym and I was going to sign up. 

I love that they have a swimming pool since I am a swimmer and I have yet to run into a time where I had to wait long for a lane. This location also has a huge basketball court which I really really love... and a huge room for classes and cycling. 

24 hour fitness in general is awesome especially since you have the ability to go to other locations in all states that they are in. 

I love this gym it's my second home and I would recomened it to anyone looking for an awesome affordable gym with up to date equipment.",1
trn_2757,"Let me tell you, if you're the type of person who has to try a little of everything just to see what it tastes like, the Bellagio buffet is a terrible idea.  My last meal here was traumatizing - it was an early weekend afternoon and brunch and lunch foods were both out for devourment.  I was starving, having walked down the strip for something like half an hour (I swear, everything in Vegas is deceptively far away) then waited in line for another half hour.  I was so damn hungry that I filled a plate with lox and ripped into it while I waited in line at the next station.  I piled up plate after plate and brought them all to my table before sitting down and tucking in.

To be honest, nothing stood out as fantastically delicious, but it was all quite good, and as far as buffet food goes, absolutely top-notch.  Sushi and sashimi were actually good quality!  One thing people seem impressed by though are the crab legs, and I found that those were too frozen and difficult to eat.  But other than that, no complaints.  And the desserts!  Oh...

But like I said, be careful!  You may feel like there are so many things to eat and goddamnit if you're not going to get your money's worth, but the crippling fullness can hurt.  I will never forget sitting curled up and moaning on the seat of a slot machine, on the point of bursting and unable to move.  Curse you Bellagio!",1

I've been looking everywhere for this limited diet food for and they were the only ones that had it.

I will be back again! :)",1
trn_2761,"Ay ay ay ay!  This place has so many crazy rules!  Two are listed below...

1. can't usually accommodate big parties unless the party has 25 people or more and then the banquet room can be used.  For a party of 18, this was a bit frustrating but we were there for a birthday party and wasn't going to stress about it.

2.  When you order a pitcher of margarita, you can only have four glasses.  So for six, you have to order two pitchers! not a bad rule, I guess, but is there a need for this rule at all?

I was forewarned that the food is especially spicy.  I can attest with minor burns on my tongue from the salsa as evidence.  I am sensitive to spicy food but was really intent on trying the house specialty, adovada, which is as spicy as the salsa.  I ordered chimichanga with beef adovada a la carte, since I was full from chips and spicy salsa and two pitchers of margarita!  I also asked for a side salad but they don't serve side salad, so the server offered to add extra lettuce garnish on the plate.

My chimichanga was plated on a platter with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce surrounding it.  WOW for the lettuce garnish.  Was it prescience, common sense, or clairvoyance that made me order a pile of lettuce with my meal?  Whatever the impetus for this action, it was a smart move as the adovada was on the salty side, packed with spicy heat!  If you take the salt away, it would just be spicy.  If you take the spice away, it would just be salty.  Chili peppers do have a flavor to them, and I like it when that tartness, or bitter-sour flavor comes through, and the spice envelopes it in texture.  The spiciness was so poignant that it numbed my tongue a bit, unable to taste, and which could explain why it was salted the way it was.  The additional sides of the lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole really rounded out the chimi, and I ended up enjoying my meal.  the third pitcher of margarita could have helped reach the level of enjoyment.

Los Dos Molinos seems to be a favorite place but for reasons of which I am not certain.  I liked my meal, but was not spectacular, the prices were not so good that I would come back for cheap eats, the location was too far to add to my rotation...

My rec, is to go with three other people, (four total) who like the adrenaline rush of super spicy salsa.",-1

I was at the store today to set up the new phone. The intake person greeted me and was fine. I was the only person there waiting for assistance. But the technician  behind the desk refused to acknowledge me. When another customer behind me walked in, she walked past me to have a prolonged conversation with that person while ignoring me. It was a very odd experience because she seemed to want me to know she was ignoring me.The intake person was nowhere to be found. After a long wait, I was about to walk out when the other technician became available to help. She was very helpful, professional and pleasant to work with. But I would be hesitant to buy another phone from here given the overall experience.",-1

trn_2765,"Dropped my car off at the tire center for a rotation And to fix a slow leak. Told one hour and twenty minutes. Went back an hour and thirty minutes and they had no idea when they could get to it.  The excuse was that I didn't have an appointment.  If you don't have an appointment you don't exist in their system.  Don't waste your time as a ""walk in"" as the appointments will be processed first and they may never get to your car.",-1
trn_2766,This place is great to have down the street from me. It was featured on a food network show so it's very popular. There is ALWAYS a line. Do not expect to walk in and be seated immediately unless you're there first thing in the morning or 10 min before close. They are worth the wait though. Best to go with 2-4 people and if you bring more than that it will be very difficult to seat you. They have tiny booths and tables only. Once again...it's worth the struggle. Their French toast is to die for and I constantly order the West coast Benedict.,1
trn_2767,We went The Bagel Cafe yesterday 8/15/2018.   It was great.  My husband and I shared a corn beef pastrami sandwich on marble rye bread it was delicious we also had a potato knish and a spinach knish which were great we will be going back soon,1

trn_2769,"We have used Dodge Electric several times. The only issue I have had that has been bad (for me, not for them) was that they are always booked out and it's hard to get an appointment quickly. AND you have to have them come out, give you a bid, and then schedule again for them to do the work.

Their work has always been top-notch, although they do leave the drywall repairs for another person to do, just so you know (I would think that's normal for electricians). But they have had to fix botched electrical jobs that others have done and they fixed them well, or did our jobs right the first time, every time we have used them.",1

trn_2776,"Just tried this place for the first time today and we were pleasantly surprised.  First the place is not called Bombay something where the cook does not know North Indian cooking. The chef is from New Delhi. So it's real indian food. We tried Khurchan chicken curry which is like similar to karahi chicken and onion kulcha. It was fresh chicken ... not dry or smelly kind. The roadside chaat app was not really chaat but bhelpuri. A little on the sweet side but we still liked it. We have eaten at a bunch of places, even Brampton,  but this is true north indian cosmopolitan food.. A++. Didn't have a gastric burn or need soda afterwards for digestion.",1
trn_2777,As an avid fan of family/friend style chinese food. I definitely recommend this restruant. I always come here with a group of friends and order a few dishes and we're always stuffed amd satisfied. Service is pretty good and the staff tends to questions quickly! I recommend :),1

Beer is always cold and great drink specials. Never had a bad meal... the new larger wings are fantastic! Come by you will not be disappointed!",1
trn_2781,"I love this place! I finally had the chance to try it last night on my final night in Vegas. The reason for four stars versus five is because they don't open until 5pm. We wanted to try it two other times before last night but they weren't open. I could understand this if it was open late as an after hours hangout until 4am or so but they still close at 2am. They also don't have any kind of food menu. I think they'd benefit from something small for late night like a cheese plate or charcuterie or even pastry plate or something. 

However, I really loved this bar. The decor is warm and a little quirky with odd artwork and lamps with oversized tassels. It reminded me of the bar from The Shining but modernized and without the whole horror movie thing haha. They have a nice selection of whiskeys, ryes, and bourbons. We tried two of their signature drinks (Napoleon's Dynamite and Pina Verde) and they were delicious. Our bartender, Nick, was really wonderful. He was knowledgeable and great to chat with. We also tried their homemade fireball which was so good! It's very different from fireball and I'd describe it more like chai. 

There was a live band last night and they were pretty good. The place was pretty dead though and I'm hoping that was due to it being a Monday at around 12:30am versus how it typically is in there. It really is great and I highly recommend checking it out if you're in Vegas!",1
trn_2782,"I did 90% of my shopping from this mall. It had a wide range of outlet stores to choose from and it was easy to get around. What was also awesome is the parking stall indicator. If there was a parked call, it would have a red light above the stall. If it was empty, the light would be green. Very, very helpful when looking for parking.",1
trn_2783,"The theater is pretty well kept, if a little old and dated. The location is great, the popcorn is top notch, and there is always a great selection of movies.

But that parking! It is a battle every time, no matter what time you show up. 1 in the afternoon, 10 in the evening, you are still driving around for 10 minutes at least, likely parking far enough away to work up a mighty sweat. And that's on a good day. If it is prime time Friday, make that 20 minutes, and you also likely yelled and cursed the heavens.

It is for this reason alone that my experience is consistently a 3-star experience, no higher. Despite everything else being good, that parking situation is just awful.",0
trn_2784,Team Green recently worked with Jan Green on one of her listings and she was great! Provided great customer service and really communicated well throughout the whole process.,1
trn_2785,"I love pizza!

After reading all of the reviews, my husband and I decided to place an order for delivery today!

We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, half with sausage & pepperoni.  It was delivered within 35 minutes to our house.  (-1 star: $3 delivery fee.)

The crust was a perfect combo of chewy and sturdy and yummy.  The sauce isn't too acidic (my husband gets acid reflux like crazy) and it didn't affect him at all.

We will order from here again, b/c they deliver good quality pizza.

Now excuse me while I go inhale another piece of pizza...

-UPDATE:
So I just updated this because after eating the pizza, you feel ok.  Then about 30 minutes later you realize you just ate the greasiest pizza ever and and you want to hurl.  I'll pass next time if someone wants me to eat Biaggio's pizza.",-1
trn_2786,"Atmosphere was very appropriate for a smokehouse with brick, brown wood booths with sufficient privacy and a central bar with sports tv and just enough smokey smell to enjoy the ambiance.
Service was prompt and friendly enough, but with just a touch of perfunctory, like an orator who gave the same speech once too often.
The drinks were served promptly, but the table service was a bit lagging and our sectional staff seemed more interested in talking at a table that either had their family or current or former staff. 
Our table had a short rack of pork ribs and beef brisket with sides of Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts and French fried potatoes.
The rack was served without the 4 sauces which were available at the table for individual taste. Both the ribs and brisket were just average and the brisket was barley warm at service. The ribs were noticeably salty, sure to the dry rub.",0
trn_2787,"It was ok for what it was. Went there using a discount and it was just ok. The food was mediocre. I'd say a slight level above Hometown Buffet which isn't saying much. We also had the oldest, nicest, but slowest server in the place. It's ok but I won't be coming back.",0
trn_2788,"I'm a gym snob and have been at least 20 different gyms in Chicago and about 8 in Phoenix (moved here about a year ago). My wife and I work out almost daily and I can generally rationalize spending quite a bit of money on a gym - hence our trial period at this gym. I'm not sure why this place has such great reviews. The weight area is extremely weak. As in, a recent stay at the Grand Hyatt in downtown San Diego had a much better weight area. This place is also full of kids with parents who let them run all over the place. Yes, this place is clean and marvelous but if you actually want to work out, besides classes, this place isn't worth the money at all. I think Life Time is a better overall value with notably better machines.",0
trn_2789,"Since I had heard a lot about the cheese melting that takes place here, I could not resist! Plus, they serve one of my favorites--Monte Cristo, which I had to try. Their version is prepared in a deep fried variety with plenty of cheeses and meats! The taste with the fried dough reminded me of an old fashion homemade jelly donut because of the sweet sauce that was served with it. It's a huge sandwich, enough to serve a big appetite for one or splitting it with someone. I couldn't handle it all, but it was very tasty. I would definitely get it again!",1
trn_2790,Worst experience ever. A fairly regular customer that will not be returning ever. If as a company you don't take down people's information and have a policy of stopping people in the middle of ther massages and kicking them out you don't deserve my money. We called and booked came in said we had an appointment then were kicked out and told our appointment was at their other location and we needed to go there. Umm no sorry not ever returning,-1
trn_2791,"Been going to Perla for over a year and I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! 

Perla is good with cuts, color, and hair extensions. I go to her for everything. She's always accommodating when I want to try something new, and she'll help me achieve what I'm looking to get! She's efficient with time, and makes you feel like you're her only client. She pays attention to detail, and never disappoints! Many people in this city over charge for not so great quality, but she is very fair! Definitely would recommend her to anybody :)",1
trn_2792,"So glad we stopped in to Wingtime tonight. We tried the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan wings.  These weren't skimpy wings, they were a nice, substantial size and they were seasoned perfectly.  The food came out fresh and steaming. The ranch, blue cheese and chipotle honey sauces should be sold by the jar.  The crinkle cut fries and Texas toast are included in the combo, so good! The girls at the counter were patient and helpful while we took a little time to figure out our order since it was our first time.  The owner was a joy to talk to, we'll definitely be back to try some of the other wing flavors and menu items!",1

trn_2794,"I'm being nice giving it 2 stars - I expect in Scottsdale the food should be somewhat decent. Nope!

I've been in a couple of times never impressed; however, the last time I was in the food was one of the worst food I've had in a long time. The environment/decor boring.  The food I could not even eat (chorizo tacos) grease was pouring out of the taco, the only good food was the chips and salsa.  The rice/beans as a side had no flavor and were presented in a tacky dish with both together (you are in scottsdale). 

Maybe it was my experience but I'm shocked there are any reviews that are 4 star or better.",-1
trn_2795,"Outstanding!  

Small sushi shop downtown that is legit.  We ordered a little bit of everything.
Here's the rundown:
Spicy Tuna Tataki - 5 stars - Fresh with a spicy kick and smokey flavor.  Would order every visit
Chefs Choice Sashimi - Very good.  Loved the spicy wasabi and tuna
Gyoza - fresh, hot, soft with a nice dipping sauce
Miso Soup - average but good portion for only $1.50
Phili Roll - excellent size, good balance of ingredients
Green tea ice cream - creamy, fresh, lots of green tea flavor

Excellent service.  The waitress forgot our miso and I asked her for it and she apologized and said she won't charge me for it.  I offered to pay and she still took it off the bill.  

The best was Chef Juno came out at the end of our meal and greeted us and asked us how we liked it.  I admire a chef that takes pride in his work and is personable.  He also came out and thanked us for coming and just had a great attitude.

We will be back.  Highly recommend!",1
trn_2796,"Soooooo good!!!  Lovely people work here and the popcorn is shockingly delicious!!  Each kernel is popped perfectly and no stray teeth breaking seeds. They are more than accommodating and encourage you to try their many creative flavors.  I made a blend of Beer Cheddar, Kettle Corn, and Movie Theater Butter,  it was so addictive that my friends and I literally could not stop eating it and he to hide the bag.  Also, they have great nostalgia candy and fun gift packaging.  Go there!!!!!  Cheers!",1

trn_2798,"This dessert place is very lovely :), I would give more stars if I could! The menu is pretty versatile, though it is the typical dessert selection you can find almost anywhere (but I didn't come here for something new anyways haha). I had the Nutella and banana crepe and it was delicious and very nicely designed. I like that Pastel puts in effort to make their dishes look good. Atmosphere and service is good. Next time I go, I will try out their specialty cakes and lattes!",1
trn_2799,"Fat Ox is perfect! The restaurant is beautifully laid out with the floor-to-ceiling windows and the large, well-displayed bar. The servers are extremely knowledgeable and professional. The prices are high, but worth it. They served the best scallops I have EVER eaten.

It was so refreshing and enlightening to have Coach Erin listen to all my ""stuff"" and from her birds eye view she was able to help me sort through all the ideas and see a common thread, which simplified my crazy making and gave me a clearer idea of how to integrate my experiences with my strengths and passions.

The staff is always super friendly and sweet and remember my name! Loooove how thick the smoothies are, I hate super watery and runny smoothies. 

I've tried like 8 drinks from their menu but nothing tops the Apple Kiwi Kale. It's SOOO bomb and nowhere sells anything like it. I told all my friends about it and they order it now too!

Love, love, love this place. They always have some sort of deal, $5 Friday's are the best because you get the 32oz drink from the whole menu! You can also ask to split it into two cups.",1

trn_2804,"This was our 5th consecutive year at Grandview and our experience there has become worse in the last two years. The quality of clientele at the resort is on the decline and at this rate, the place will feel more like public housing than a resort. Extremely noisy guests, inoperable elevators, unheated pools and filthy poolside toilets were just the beginning. Security never addressed our raucous neighbors who forced us and our seven year-old to move to a different room at 1:00 AM. 
The AC did not work in the new room but maintenance person Milton responded promptly to temporarily fixed it until morning. The next day, maintenance was at our door first thing to fix the problem. Although this was the only positive interaction we had with staff, it is not enough to bring us back for a 6th visit.",-1

..... both positive and negative opinions. My recent breakfast experience was mixed. One of a group of 5, I was happy 5hat we were able to be seated quickly. Though I didn't find the hostesses particularly welcoming, our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. The menu was a mix of every day favorites as well as some specialty items. The  choices were amazing and certainly tempting. Everyone in my party got something different. My own more traditional breakfast was okay but not any more than that. The temperature of my eggs and grits was tepid at best. I was also taken aback slightly at the price. For an ordinary meal I  thought it was pricey. Paying at the counter I was once again disappointed in the cool demeanor of the staff. No thank you, how was it, or hope to see you again. I don't know if I will return because I've enjoyed better meals, better prices and a more friendly ambiance at other restaurants.",0

2. Peking duck
3. Fish with vegetables
4. Pork neck
5. Cooked oysters
6. Deep-fried shrimp
7. Lettuce wrap
8. Jellyfish

Their Peking duck is always pretty consistent and it's carved right on front of you. All of their dishes were pretty tasty. None were overly salty, oily, or overseasoned.

After the meal, they gave us the red bean soup dessert, sesame cookies, and jelly.

We asked him to come see what we were unhappy about and he refused and rolled his eyes! The following day we requested a late courtesy check out and he replied ""we normally allow it but in your case Im sorry we won't be able to accommodate you""  He was actually holding a grudge with us for wanting a clean room!!! To top it all off they double charged us for the room!  When we called later to be refunded they told us they had no way of refunding us!  We had to have our bank reject it.

We started out with some appetizers, Spring rolls, Beef Sate, and a order of Thai Chicken wings. The Spring rolls were excellent - two to an order. The Sate was beef and such a great grilled flavor. The Thai Chicken wings were crispy but could have had more of a Thai flavor, served with a sweet and sour sauce. Our entrees, which we shared were the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, a order of Pud Thai, which we call Pad Thai? And a order of Pud ma Maung, which was vegetables and cashews and we had Pork added as our protein. All the dishes were very good. Although I never found a Cashew in the Pud ma Maung. The Fried Rice was especially good, just a perfect Thai flavor. We ordered everything with a heat level of #4 and it was not overly hot.

trn_2819,"Waited in a VERY long line for a VERY long time to be given the privelage of paying $30-something a person for food. 

It wasn't shitty, and not the worst buffet I'd ever eaten I'm sure, but for that price plus the Bellagio name I was expecting to be wowed. LIke the kind of wow you feel after really good coitus. 

The salad bar was minimal, and the buffet was overloaded with meat. I know that most people will think that this is where you get your moneys-worth, but even so I love a great big salad at the begging of my meal. It was really shitty small, with two kinds of leafy greens, a couple of cheeses and two or three dressings. Really? 

The meat. Beef wellington--yuck. Lamb--tasted fishy (?). Turkey--dry. Seafood--only idiots eat seafood at a buffet. 

The dessert was the best part, and I really loaded up on these. Much to my chagrin, desserts combined with 10 free Heinekens= projectile vomiting. Not sure if I can blame that on the Bellagio, but I'd say that they have to take come credit for it. 

Did anyone else notice how tiny the buffet area was?",-1
trn_2820,"Great dogs. Had the Chicago Dog. Nice big dog, the hot dog snaps when you bite to it fresh ingredients. 
We also had the carne asada fries. Dang great tasting dish. All fresh ingredients and the taste of the meat the entire dish was awesome - I wish I ordered it. 
The only negative is this the fried pickle spears. Now I might be picky, but for a place that provides great tasting FRESH ingredients on the hot dogs and carne asada fries - I watched the employee take the breaded pickles out of the freezer, out of the store bought bag and place them in the fryer. Now I will say the fried pickle spears are tasty - BUT - you guys can do better - make them fresh. Make some awesome breading and put your own mark on those pickles. That said I will be back great tasting food.  
Employee that greeted us was very friendly and outgoing.  Now the place did smell a bit greasy - I'm hoping that's why the contractor was there looking at the vent hoods
Very enjoyable food.
One star deduction for the frozen fried pickle spears.",1

I would probably hesitate to call this a sandwich place; yes PBJs are sandwiches and you get tons of bread options to choose from, but almost all items (except for the grilled cheeses) on their menu are sweet, accompanied by various jams, fruits, or ice creams. As a kid a PBJ may have been a good enough ""meal,"" but I pretty much had to make do with the BLT meal to actually get something substantial in. That said, the sandwich was pretty good, and I did like being able to get my sandwich with cinnabon bread. The overall concept is great and falls somewhere in the honey toast / Belgian waffle category. I see how being able to customize your own sandwich can be pretty fun, and the ""sushi roll"" presentation of these sandwiches is cute (though really you're just paying more for the same food, sans crust). But I do think that this is a nice alternative to just ice cream or fro-yo for desserts.",1

trn_2831,"I had a great experience at Hyde Park while visiting Cleveland. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Thursday night which was fine as we had excellent service the entire night.  For apps we had a Ceaser salad and Tuna Tar Tar, both were great. The Tuna came with wontons for dipping, very fresh and delicious. For entrees I had the Steak Kosar-named after famed QB Bernie Kosar. It was a filet with lobster. The steak was cooked perfectly, the lobster was very tender and a large amount. It was good value to get both the steak and lobster versus just a steak etc. My girlfriend had the Steak Lebron, which was a huge 18oz steak covered with shrimp and Hollandaise. That was also very good but quite large. We could have done with about half the portion. But leftovers are great too. We were too full for desert, but we did have a nice bottle of wine. They had a good mix of cheaper and more expensive wines. Service was perfect and gave us some tips on the night life around town while we were visiting. It was a great start to our weekend.",1
trn_2832,"Very few restaurants cause me to drop dietary defenses, but I must admit Couscous Express had me forgetting about my food concerns. This little restaurant on E McDowell is good for lunch and an early din-din.

It lives up to the 'express' in its name. The owner didn't have us sitting for long with an empty spot on the table. We wanted to try everything, so more or less ordered the whole farm.  Meat, fish, poultry, herbs and veggies, grains, roots, legumes, fruit, dairy. It was like a continuous parade of platters were being marched to our table and the owner accommodated us with extra plates to serve the food.  

All dishes are suitable for one person, but if you don't come with a big appetite two people can share a plate and still get full. I managed to finish ev'ry bite with no leftovers. Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

The nitty-gritty on the dishes: 

- Date shake. How do you say YUM? I could wake up and drink that stuff for breakfast. It was thick, peanut-y, and not too sweet. Bet I could work through the entire morning on one date shake. Protein shake? We don't need no stinkin' protein shakes. We gots date shakes, B-otch.
- Tea was okay. Maybe if it was served after the meal and a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more. 
- Hummus was deliciously flavourful. I could eat a tub of it.
- Bread was a round of light fluffy flour that I prefer much more than pita. 
- Couscous side was absolutely delicious by itself. Whatever seasoning he used to give that salty/cheesy flavor was a surprise to the taste buds. And the texture was perfect. I took some to go and ate it by itself in front of the telly. Instead of handfuls of buttered popcorn, I had my spoonfuls of cheesy steamed couscous. What?!  Don't think I'll ever ask for another pot of boiled couscous. Steamed only going forward.
- Couscous salad. Mmmm-meh. Call me boring, but I prefer green salads. Gotta get greens.
- Lamb couscous was tender and cooked just right.
- Tangines were delicous.  Spiced right and flavourful, not at all oily - obviously simmered in their own juices. 
- Bastilla. My first time having it. If I re-order, it would have to be as a main dish with lots of side veggies. I like the top sweet crunchy phyllo but could do without the powdered sugar.  

Nitty-gritty on the decor:

Simple and tasteful. Decorated with hookahs, food stuffs, and Argan oil for sale. Changes have been made since the earlier reviews this year. To get an idea of the new layout, see the image that reviewer Franko L uploaded on May 11, 2015. There are about five small tables inside and one for a larger party. The center of the dining area is completely open so it has the appearance of plenty of space. Outside there are two large wooden tables. 

Separate restrooms for fe/male is great for a such a small place but if you wish to avoid any claustrophobic winces and cramping I suggest you use the loo before getting to the restaurant and carry wet-naps to clean your hands before eating.

Nitty-gritty on the owner:

A genuine host. There were other customers dining as well and they were getting served just as fast as us. Obviously the owner knows what he's doing. Definitely in his element with this petite-sized venue. He encouraged paced dining, conversation, and pure enjoyment of the meal. No customers were rushed into ordering or paying.

Expectations:

I wish there were more vegetables in the meals rather than so many potatoes. The few veggies I had were overcooked.

After reading other yelp reviews and drooling over pictures of food, I was looking forward to having the carrots and olives appetizers. Oh well, next time.",1
trn_2833,"I am pretty sure if you don't  like this place, you might be a member of the Nazi Party. This was a pretty awesome experience. I don't think I've been anywhere where I was encouraged to try as many flavors as possible. And the flavors? So good and so inventive. Pear and Blue Cheese? Seriously. Yummmmmmm. White chocolate coffee bean?  I wish I could come here every day. I think if I was a kid and my parents told me I could, I would be a pretty diabetic adult right now. 
Everything is natural and almost all the flavors I tried seem to mend together beautifully. There is new flavors all the time and I can't wait to go back again and again. The Golden Standard of Gelato in the Las Vegas area.",1
trn_2834,"At first I was annoyed. The male worker taking my order took to long to get it down and made me feel like it was his first day. He repeated it a few times, which is fine with me, it ensures a correct order. Than the wait. As this was my first visit here I thought this might be my last. I waited about 6mins. 

But when I got home, my food was delicious and correct! It was freshly made, which explained the longer wait. The fries were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. So good! Being that I'm a Fry snob. The 4 chicken tenders were crispy and just right amount of spicy. The inside was nice and tender too! The biscuit was extra honey, which is one thing I love about Church's...and also the reason I stay away. Its hard to stop at just one. 

I'll take the long wait if it means that I get fresh, hot food!",0

We were there in a party of 8:  We had 2 moderately priced bottles of chardonnay, 7 salads, 8 entrees, 4 sides.  No apps, no desserts.  Our bill was $690 before tip.  I suppose this is acceptable for those of you from the East Coast, but I would never pay that much twice.  I hear they have a weekday happy hour in the bar.  That is probably as far as I'd go.",0

The service was good and we both ordered the combination platter that had brisket, pulled pork and ribs. It also came with two sides. I ordered the mac n' cheese along with the baked beans. The food was really tasty and the sauce was nice and peppery. I do wish they had a variety of sauces though. My sides were ok but not amazing. I was sad about the mac because I thought it was overcooked and not super flavorful. Even the best mac n' cheese can be ruined by overcooked noodles so it's even worse when the mac isn't the greatest to begin with. Overall, the food was pretty good but I don't think I would choose Twelve over other options in the area.",0

We stumbled in here one day and we are not sure how we lived without it!

$2 beers from the bar always FYI....with an amazing selection.  Andrew, the regular bartender is the best!!!  Hilarious and will remember you after your first visit!

Ask for the cheese menu....you won't regret it!

All kinds of beer and wine....it's a giant beer/wine store with a mini Harris Teeter inside minus  the produce section.  Competitive prices...better than regular Harris Teeter on beer/wine (same owners).

Hang at the bar!  It's always fun but low key.  Not for party-goers.

There is a party room you can rent for $50!  Bring your own food....must buy drinks from there.

I usually finish my plate, but I actually had to take some of my dinner home with me. The loaded baked potato was awesome and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. For two meals it only cost me less than $30. $15 a person for two steak dinners isn't bad! My only complaint was the salad I ordered before my meal.

Then I was like ok, I want a caramel macchiato. He mumbled something under his breath, so thinking that he couldn't make it, I started to say ""ok then I'll have something else."" He bit back with ""NO! Do you want iced or heated?!"" I said iced. I also wanted a bagel; I looked him straight in the eyes and ordered my bagel while he was gossiping with someone else and he never gave me my bagel xS, never even processed that I had ordered something else.

trn_2852,"24 hour burgers on the strip.  This was my first Fatburger experience and I got to say that they have a good thing going.  I would put them above most fast food spots, but I don't think they top in n out.  I love the fact that you can get steak fries (the best choice), but the regular fries are better than average as well.  Generally you have to decide how much meat you want and that will determine the cost and size of your burger (they also have some other meat choices as well).  They have other toppings too, which actually makes their burgers somewhat customizable.  I seem to remember even getting asked what type of cheese I wanted?!?!? Bring on the cheese choice revolution.
I found the prices reasonable for LV strip, and the wait (at 1:00p on a weekday) was about 25 minutes.  Don't expect a seat though, as the dining area was pretty crowded the whole time I was there and it almost certainly is worse at night.
I didn't find the staff to be *fun* like other reviewers did, but they were certainly doing their job and that is all I really ask of anybody.
I imagine if you show up at night you need to be prepared for a totally different scene that is less focused on the food and more on finding something to soak up all that margarita by the yard or random neon colored alcohol beverage.  I may visit at night just to see what the spectacle looks (and also 24 hours, relatively quick is better than almost every other option out there)",1
trn_2853,"DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL. I should've known better. I should've researched Brown Mackie college and I should've saved myself the head ache and went somewhere else. This school is absolutely awful. The ""core"" classes are a joke. The teachers either don't know what they're teaching or just don't care. You can pass without even learning a think because every quiz and exam is open book. They don't teach you shit. They read off power points and when you get off topic there's no chance you'll get back on the subject you're supposed to be learning. Now as far as the actual program sick as surg tech, OT, criminal justice, nursing... Completely different story. I am only speaking  on the Nursing program. It blows. This schools nursing program is 1. You pay a lot more money, it's EXPENSIVE AS FUCK. 2. It's inly one class a month, which sounds cool. But if you're paying $50,000 for a ADN you should have more than 11 days of school. 3. THEY ARE NOT ACCREDITED. I repeat THEY ARE NOT ACCREDITED. Lastly, don't piss off these instructors. The only cool professors were obviously the ones I didn't have. Lab is awful, you sit there trying not to fall asleep because the teachers go on and on and on and onnnnnn. Also DONT act like yourself, She'll tell you that you need to act like an ""adult"" if she doesn't like the way you're doing basically anything. These people don't care. Are you sick? Do you have the flu, or something contagious? That's okay go to school anyways, because if you don't they'll automatically fail you. Oh and when you'll call EVERYONE on campus to ask if missing a day will fail you, everyone will say they don't know, they don't have an answer for you, they don't think so but they aren't sure... But it'll blow up in your face anyways because these people don't know what the fuck they're doing. Just don't even think about getting sick, just live in a bubble because they think you can completely control when you get sick or not and if you're in their nursing program you cannot ever get sick. Ever. Also don't tell them that your mother does anything for you, you need to be an adult and make your own decisions, they'll be very disappoints if you don't and ITS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. They will also low key insult you if you don't look like you're ""healthy"" (ex. Poor diet, not enough exercise) aka if you're of a bigger statue. Just don't go here, ever. Please find another school that doesn't completely fucking suck. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS SCHOOL IS THE FINANCIAL AID. My financial advisor was awesome. But seriously that's the ONLY thing that does fucking suck at this poor excuse for a school. They just want your money, they could care less about your education. #BYEBMC",-1

I visited a Speedway in Westlake, OH for the first time (usually go to Shell or BP), and told the cashier that I needed $40 dollars worth of unleaded.  Went back to my car, and the pump was not working!  I went back inside, and the cashier told me that it should be working.  I go outside again, and the pump is not working!  He then asks me if I was pumping unleaded.  I said, yes, I am trying to put premium unleaded in my car.  He then tells me, ""oh, well you said unleaded""!  To which I replied, ""Really?!  You have to specify the EXACT kind of unleaded that you want to switch the pump on?!"".  He says, ""yes"".  Now how STUPID is that!  Every single other gas station i've been to, in many states, don't require you to specify which EXACT gas you are putting in, unless it is Diesel!  You just ask for a certain amount of gas, pay the cash, then CHOOSE AT THE PUMP.  But the morons at Speedway have decided to break convention, and ask the customer to exactly specify which exact gas... unbelievably stupid!",-1
trn_2857,"[Good]
Flavours - What makes this place good is the flavour of the broth.  It's always robust and tasty no matter what choice.

Ingredients - Not too bad when it comes to portion size and the amount of stuff that comes with the ramen.  Whether it's tenderous rib or BBQ pork, I don't feel like they skimp.

Menu - Small, focused menu leads to better quality.

[Bad]
Prices - I used to come here a lot because it offered a tasty bowl at great value but it seems prices have gone up along with all the other ramen places.

Slow - Literally just a mom and pop shop.  The wife serves and the husband cooks in the back.  Although a small restaurant, sometimes the food comes out slowly, especially when ordering yaki soba.

[Worth it?]
On this latest visit, it didn't feel like old times and I didn't find myself enjoying it as much as before.  Maybe with the higher price I set a higher standard or maybe other places have stepped up their game since then.

In previous years it would be a no brainer value winner.  Now that prices have gone up, I'm not sure $15 for a bowl is considered value anymore.  Still, if you haven't been here before, it's worth at least a try.  If you have been here before, then you already know that you will at least have a decently enjoyable meal.",1

trn_2859,"When trying to think of things to say about Sal's that haven't been said already, it's very easy to avoid mentioning the pizza itself. So, i'll get that out of the way immediately: It's easily in the top 3 in Madison, if not #1. You only need to read the menu to know that you're going to get something good, as the concoctions and topping choices alone should tell you a lot about what you're going to get: Very fresh taste, and unique flavors. This alone obviously makes it worth a trip.

But like nearly every other restaurant in the world, Sal's is more than just one type of item, it's well, a restaurant. So how does it stack up there? I'd say decently, but not amazingly. When it comes to the space, it's definitely too small. Some would call it intimate, but i'd call it cramped. The only time there isn't a wait for a table is right when they open. While being a crowded place certainly helps the hype factor, it's a bit detracting from the experience. At the very least, they do allow take out, and you can order and eat at Johnson Public House, so that makes up for some of the space problems.

When it comes to their non-pizza offerings, I have mixed feelings. They're at the very least interesting, but not really for everyone. I've tried the burrata, and thought it was a good starter. I've also had the veggie tacos. Some people love these tacos it seems, but I was more ""eh"" on them. They definitely taste fresh, but they rely too much on the spice of the peppers to give it flavor. So to me, it turns out being kind of bland, and actually somewhat unpleasant. If you're into spice though, these may be for you!

So I think that Sal's do the pizza nearly perfectly, but they could tune up in a couple areas by tweaking some of the menu options. If they did that, then it would be a top-tier dining experience!",1

Being a pub, not a club, you think they would turn down the background music so that you are catch up with people.  Nope, they had it blaring in the background and it was like I was yelling at my friends the whole night.

Small, not crowded, 24/7 access even on holidays. only downside is there  are no showers, so just make sure you give yourself time to get home and shower if you need to be somewhere after your workout. ( would have gave 5 stars if had showers)Also which is nice is you can watch what you want on one of the t.v's, compared to other gyms where your forced to watch what they put on.  Also you have the option to pay month to month which is AWESOME since a contract with a gym is like  a marriage, so you def do not feel trapped with this place.

Love it, just wished I knew what the hell they were saying. The decor and ambiance isn't the most intimate, but you really don't come here for that. This is the breakdown of the sea carnage that went down at our table of 2. 

Toro - Not always available, we jumped at the opportunity to indulge in the belly of beast! Melts in your mouth delicious!!!

Shrimp Tempura - Tempura is always touchy for me. The batter is everything and a lot of times its too thick. Harumi's tempura was perfect! Almost as good as my favorite place in Maui (Sansei). 

Stuffed Jalapenos - You did what with that pepper? You stuffed it with crab and tempura'd that garnish from south of the border? Yeah, and it works. 

Ramen - Hey, you can't pass up an chance to have Ramen that isn't out of a bag! We really didn't expect the kick that this ramen had, but luckily for me it was so spicy that it was all mine to slurp and gulp!! No dry seasoning packets used in this bowl. Awesomeness.

From the outside it was a little scary since all of the windows are blacked out (LV sun) and you can't see anything inside.  I was afraid to go in thinking it was a massage palor.  But as soon as I opened the door, the place was humming with activity - a rather surprising sight.  What can I say about a place that offers not 2 but 3!!! different types of cuisine -- and all my favorites!!!  You have your Korean, then you get the Chinese Korean menu and finally Hawaiian!!! all in one single stop!  The place is run by a family and it appears everyone from the family works there - father, mother and 2 sons (they looked alike).  I'm pretty sure they were Koreans originally from Hawaii -- there's that island infused look they have.   

I had the Korean naeng mein and garbi ribs combo plus a spam musubi.  It wasn't the best naeng mein, garbi or the musubi I had.  What makes this place special is that it has a home made feel to everything.  The garbi, definitely was marinated ""island"" style.  I also noticed their Loco Moco and it looked darn good!

trn_2875,"Was planning to purchase a Groupon special (70 min massage for $49 plus 20% promo code = $39) but the guy on the phone said he couldn't do the additional promo code and if i didn't go through groupon he could offer a 70 min massage for $45. 

In the end, for $45 they only did a 50 min massage AND they still expected a tip! Tip is given for good service! The masseuse didn't do a good job either. She seemed new and inexperienced.",-1
trn_2876,"I was super stoked when this place opened up because not only was it new, there were some rave reviews. Unfortunately, I wasn't too stoked about the pho broth. The presentation is cute though, I love how they laid out their egg rolls. 

I haven't been back since for a reason. I may have gone on their off day, as they had just opened when I had visited.",0
trn_2877,"What to do when insomnia sets in?  Write yelp reviews lol.  So i went to Basil Box a few hours ago after securing coupons for a free drink and meal.  This is a Thai restaurant.  How it works is that you line up to order your food as if you are back in a high school cafeteria.  You are then asked to pick your carb first, so i chose pasta.  Next comes the veggies.  I went for corn and peppers since i was allowed to pick two.  Then protein.  My friends went for shrimps but i opted for steak instead.  The steak was more akin to dices of beef.  2nd last step is to select your sauce.  In this case, they encouraged me to be creative by mixing chilli lime sauce with peanut sauce.  Finally you choose toppings for your dish.  I told them to sprinkle a bit of everything on my pasta.
To be honest i was apprehensive about this quirky dish that i created what with 2 different sauces mixed together, but i have to say it wasn't bad.  The steak should really just be called beef.  It was a bit spicy and flavourful.  I liked the nuts and mixes that were thrown into the pasta.  The food was ok.  
I also ordered mango ginger ale soda and boy! That was a great refreshing summer drink!  My friends ordered Thai iced tea and all said it was too sweet.
And that was my friday night food experience.  That's all folks!",0
trn_2878,"We came here on a Saturday night with a group of 7. Since there was a lot of us they recommend us getting omakase experience which is getting the server a price point that each of us is willing to pay and they can provide different dishes within that price range. On average, people would do $50 - $60 each. 

One by one, we had several dishes come out. All of us enjoyed every dish and the notable ones are wagyu beef gyoza (so flavorful!), seared wagyu beef (perfect for large groups),  crispy yellowtail taquitos (fresh and full of flavor!), and the grilled fish/chicken kabobs (not dry at all).

Service was fantastic, they were very attentive and giving us new plates, cleaning up our table, and providing new silverware when necessary. It was a couple of our party's 30th birthday and they gave us shots on the house, how sweet is that?

I would definitely return while in Vegas!",1
trn_2879,I love this store because they have all the top brand names in clothing for the plus size individuals. Who says you can't have beautiful clothes and be a plus size person. The store is amazing. All the displays are matched perfectly and it's easy to get around in the store. The staff gets an A+ in my book for customer service. I'm a repeat customer and am usually always greeted by name.,1
trn_2880,"I've been a customer, along with my husband, to Anthony's Grill since I first moved into the Don Mills area about 7 years ago. And have loved almost every one of our visits.

This place has a wide variety of appetizers and entrees, with some vegetarian selections. It also has a few items that we've not been able to get anywhere else, such as the calf's liver and a grouper fish entree, two of my husband's favourites. My personal favourites are the turkey BLT, Pork Schnitzel, and souvlaki dinner. 

The staff really know us there, and we have taken friends there for lunch or dinner several times over the years. Even when we went there for a turkey dinner one Thanksgiving, when it was rather busy, the food was still perfectly cooked. 

We are usually able to get the seats we prefer, by the window, even when it's quite busy, which happens occasionally, mostly on weekends.

While it is a little on the pricier side, if you need a reasonably priced, but classy experience with a variety of food to serve different tastes, Anthony's is a place to eat at.",1
trn_2881,"I'm so glad to see this place is successful, so I don't have to feel bad about avoiding it. When they opened up, they were trying so hard. My husband and I had a coffee there and it was an awkward, weird experience. A poor costumed (French?) teenager had to serve us the coffee and bring us a bottle of water. It seemed forced and cringe-inducing. They have excellent products though, and I wish them the best.",-1
trn_2882,Disappointed on second visit. First visit had perfect coffee second visit a sloppy pour. Excellent coffee is about consistency I hope this location can keep the bar high.,-1
trn_2883,"I've eaten at In-N-Out Burger before when I was in Las Vegas (required me to drive from my Strip hotel) but this location is the first (and currently only) In-N-Out located on the Strip. It opened somewhat recently (less than 1 month ago). People are always comparing In-N-Out (West Coast) with Shake Shack (East Coast) and now that In-N-Out is located on the Strip, people can enjoy both while strolling on the Strip.

This In-N-Out is located in the Linq Promenade area.

When I went in, I was immediately greeted by people behind the cash register. I wasn't sure what I wanted yet so I didn't line up. After I quickly looked at the items advertised above the cash register and decided to get a double burger combo. The prices seemed higher than ""normal"" but I would assume that it is because it is on the Strip. I asked for the animal style fries (which isn't shown on the menu on the top of the cash register). I was handed a cup so went to the soft drink dispenser to get my drink. I opted for Dr. Pepper since they didn't have the soft drink that I normally prefer which is Coke Zero. After a few minutes, they called out my number and I went to get my tray.

Even though there wasn't much of a line-up to order, the sit-in area was almost completely filled. I managed to get a seat when someone left. Cellphone reception was somewhat spotty inside the restaurant (I'm with T-Mobile) but the restaurant did have free wireless so I was able to update my status of Facebook as well as include pictures of my meal on social media.

When I finished my meal, I went to refill my drink and asked where the washroom/toilette was in the place and one of the employees informed me that there wasn't one inside the restaurant and I had to either go inside the casino or go to the public washroom within the Linq Promenade. Not knowing where the public washroom is within the Linq Promenade was located, I opted to walk to the casino to use the washroom and wash my hands since my burger was messy (but delicious).

Them not having a washroom inside the restaurant and their prices being higher than ""normal"" are the reasons why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",1
trn_2884,"Fun place to meet friends. The food was delicious, and the service/bar staff were on point.  Always our go-to spot before any Steelers/Pirates game, or even to stop and get a drink and bite to eat before a concert at Stage AE.  Plenty of seating both at the bar and dinner tables.  The crowd always has energy and the staff shows everyone a good time.  Definitely the best spot for fun on the north shore.",1

trn_2887,"I reserved and rented a one-way covered trailer from U-Haul in Champaign-Urbana, IL on University Ave on May 15th. 

This reservation was made weeks in advance in anticipation of an out of state move that required extensive planning. (also, this weekend was graduation of a major state university located in town) I recieved a call from the location the day prior confirming my pick up time and rental. On the day of pick up - the computer system was ""down"". The employees inside ultimately told us they were not able to assign a one-way trailer without access and that they were unable to help me. No other locations nearby were open or had available trailers in any size. As advised, I contacted the general manager, Andre Hubbard, who was out of the area. 

Mr. Hubbard was rude, inconsiderate, and unhelpful. He made no effort to reach a resolution. During our call - he never asked for my name, the details of my reservation, or the reservation number I had available. He made degrading and insulting remarks in my ability to understand the situation. Even after I asked specifically, he did not offer to contact anyone else in the regional area for assistance.

With no help or direction from Andre, I contacted the number written on the vehicle in the parking lot: 1 800 - go - Uhaul. A woman in transportation, Tammy, was immediately able to assist me and provide me a trailer assignment. 

I spent more than 3 hours waiting and delayed during my rental pick up due to the poor management and operations of this establishment. Many other customers were affected on this same day. If it was not for my own perseverance, I would have not received a trailer or continued with my plans to move. 

The employees at the establishment were eager and willing to help. With some direction and resources provided from management, the location  would immensely improve. It is clearly that Uhaul as a company provides great opportunity for customer care and that Andre choose not to demonstrate it.


---- I contacted UHAUL Customer Service with no response or resolution",-1
trn_2888,"I give this restaurant 4 stars because I love the look of it and Sam is the most awesome waitress ever! She's so sweet and polite and is on the ball. Our drinks were constantly refilled and she made sure we had everything we need. Best waitress ever! The only reason I deducted one star is because I feel the menu is a little limited, but I know since it's new that it is still growing. Another perk of the GCU Hotel Canyon 49 Grill is that you can use your dining dollars if you're a GCU student like me. :)",1
trn_2889,This was a great quick stop for food. It is reasonably priced for Vegas but the line is usually pretty long. I had the egg and sausage sandwich with the honey mustard aoli and it was perfect. The egg was cooked medium so there was some yoke that broke but didn't overcome the sandwich.,1

We ordered the chicken eggrolls and Emperor's Chinese Soup.  And it was unbelievably delicious!!!!  It wasn't salty....all the chicken, pork and shrimp and wontons were cooked perfectly!!!!  I can't wait to go back and have this soup on a cold day!  It was better than most high end oriental restaurants.  So...whoever is cooking the oriental food on Oct. 9, 2014 at about 3pm....knows what they're doing in a kitchen!  And the eggrolls were awesome as usual!  And thanks to our server Richard....he made it an enjoyable experience from beginning to end!  :)  Thanks Richard :)",1

trn_2893,"Just a warning portion is HUGE like our American neighbours :)   I went to the soft opening and they have tons of staffs.  Seems running quite smoothly and the food taste great.  Of course the highlight is the chessecake and just FYI they are not made in Canada but delivered directly from the warehouse in the states where they have the best quality control.  I ordered the calamari, pizza style chicken parmesan and the godiva cheesecake.  The calamari is big, I would say that's probably the size of two appetizers in a normal restaurant.  The chicken parmesan for $20.50 is prob the best deal you can get.  The chicken is shaped like a pizza on the bottle and the angel hair pasta lays on top.  The cheesecake, you know how good it is I dun even need to explain.  Must try for comfort food lover and be prepare to line up as they dont take reservation.  Feel free to shop in yorkdale during your wait, there's always tons of great retailers to see.",1

trn_2896,"I have been to Mimi's several times and at many different locations around the valley. I enjoy going there for breakfast as I am not a huge fan of their lunch selections. I love their Mixed Berry Pain Perdu, which is stuffed french toast, their turkey sausage is very good as well and lets not forget their Sunrise Pomosa to wash it all down with! While I am a fan of their breakfast I will have to say that it didn't matter which Mimi's location I was at they definitely lack in service, our waiter/waitress was rarely around and if you needed refills on your drinks you had to flag down another employee just to have them ask your waiter/waitress for you. Overall its a place to go for breakfast when you are not in hurry!",0
trn_2897,"Was so excited to go, and to use a 2for1 coupon.  Service was ok, prices were ok.  What a surprise when our food came! What were supposed to be entrees were toddler-sized portions.  Their sauces tasted 'muddy', like they were reheated several times.  Lamb seekh kebab was very dry.  Very disappointing. Then came the bill - the 2for1 coupon was actually for only $10 (seriously?!?!). There are 69 entrees on their menu - only 2 of which were $10.  Come on!!  I love Indian food but this was beyond disappointing.  I give them only 1 star and that's only for the model they have of the Taj Mahal.  Dismal experience which won't be repeated.",-1

Eat ahead of time there is no real food...TRON high score is mine...at least for a brief moment...",1
trn_2901,"Such a great location for some brunch. My girls and I ordered different things so we can all try a little bit of everything. Everyone seemed to enjoy their peach Bellini, blood orange mimosa, Bloody Mary, and I loved my white sangria. Very refreshing. 

We ordered a salad, margarita pizza, crab lettuce wraps, frittata with bacon, eggs Benedict, grilled cheese, ricotta pancakes, and monkey bread. First and foremost, I have to rave about the monkey bread because it was the first item we shared. Omgggahhhhhhh *eyes rolling back*, it was just amazing. Theeee best monkey bread EVER! I don't think I'll ever make them at home again haha. It's perfection. That alone is enough to bring me back.

Everything else was good too. I was expecting more from the Ricotta pancakes the strawberry preserves was pretty over powering that the pancakes did not stand out. I especially enjoyed the frittata with bacon. 

Service was overall great. Friendly staff. Everyone greets you upon entry and exit. My friends kept raving about the hand scrub in the bathrooms too.",1

That I had learned to style and have been trying to grow out for about a year. Some how, Tatjana was able to completely fix it! She was able to fix my hair without taking off very much length. She gave me exactly what I wanted, plus more! She didn't cut an excessive amount, rather she just fixed the cut shape. She really listens to what you want and delivers!!! I wasn't even aware that anything other than cutting my hair short was an option in order to fix my previous cut, but Tatjana found the perfect way! She not only is amazing at her job, but she also has a great personality and is very helpful and honest. I am so happy to have found my hairdresser in Las Vegas!

Close to my house.
Not at a mall.
Comfy seats.

Things I don't love so much:

I need a booster seat for most of the seats.  Seriously.  Even when no one is in front of me, the back of the seat is in my view.

It's sometimes difficult to see a movie that is NOT 3D, D-BOX, or Star Class.  I was forced to see Pirates (which I was not happy about seeing to begin with) in either 3D or Star Class...both with an upcharge.

And the number one reason I can't give UltraStar the 4th star?

Specialty popcorns are available only in the 55-gallon drums.  Why?  They're not even made there, but scooped from a 110-gallon drum from underneath the counter.  So why can't they scoop it in a bag instead of the drum?  Am I complaining because of the cost?  No, at $7, it's only 50 cents more than their outrageous pricing of a smaller size anyway.  Is it because I can't eat the contents of the drum?  That's a stupid question.  The problem is I WILL eat the contents of the drum, which means I can't order it.  Fix that and I'll be a fan.",0

I love that they have French press coffee as well as a bar along with their dessert options. The employees were wonderful all around, especially considering the fact that they were working on Halloween night. They gave us plenty of free bacon fat salted caramel samples (YUM) and made sure we were enjoying everything. We stayed up until about ten minutes to closing and they made no rush to kick us out or let us know that it was almost time to go. Speaking of the closing time, I love being able to go somewhere like this (a place with a coffee shop feel) and be able to stay until midnight! That is pretty unheard of, but something I really enjoyed. The employees were wonderful, the options were plentiful, and it has an overall great atmosphere.",1
trn_2911,"DO NOT EAT HERE!! THEY SERVED RAW CHICKEN THEN DENIED IT ONCE THEY TOOK IT AWAY!!!!!!!!!! 

Nothing like sitting down for a nice lunch on my day off and getting 1/3 way into my chicken dish only to notice that the meat is raw!!! NOT WHITE. Pink to dark pink in color. So just had to run to the restroom as the thought of just eating raw chicken made me lose what I already ate of the lunch. I thought it was overcooked when I first bit into it cause of the consistency. Boy was I on the wrong end of the spectrum. SO disgusted right now. Stomach is flipping around. 

It's a medium sized pan grilled chicken fish. How the heck do u serve that raw?!?!?!

It's been 15 mins now since I notified my server. He's been very apologetic. Said the manager would be right out and he's still not here. I'm sitting here nauseated, unhappy and they're making wait now?!?!?! 

Waiter just told me he's testing the chicken before coming to see me?!?! Seriously?!?!?!

I cannot be more upset right now. The manager, Aaron, came out, immediately had an attitude asking me ""So what's you're problem with the food?"" He's now denying that the chicken was raw. He's saying it was completely white, lying to my face!! Even the server verified it was raw when he took it!!!!!! If it was clearly white like he claims, why the 20 min wait so they could test their cooking times and the chicken?????

This is how you run a business?!?! This is how you deal with making a mistake?!?! Tell me I'm lying so you can cover yourselves?!?! Cause I have so much to gain by a partially eaten meal and vomiting in the bathroom?!?! 

Do yourselves a favor and do not eat here!!

Update: The icing on the cake. Apparently when u post a bad review on yelp the employees or friends of the employees for this establishment take it upon themselves to send you nasty private messages via yelp using newly created fake accounts. 

While I appreciate the owner Mike returning my phone call and offering us a free dinner, until they get new in-store management we won't ever be back.",-1

I am glad those two factors alone led us to Freddy's. It is a fun restaurant with a southern-50's charm. Everyone is friendly and accommodating. I loved the single patty steak burger with extra pickles. Get it California style to ensure you get tomato and lettuce! 

Normally I don't care for thin-sliced fries, or shoe string fries, but these ones were great. They have seasoning to add to the fries as well as sauce.

On to Hob Nob... it's a really lovely remodel, if a little slick and glossy.  I thought the coffee was very good.  I haven't been able to eat there yet, but the menu looks great, if a little pricey.  Pastry selection seemed a little small too, especially as coffee shop= guilt free decadent eating in my mind, so I want some outrageous and fatty desserts to choose from.

Local artwork on the walls, with some pieces that I really loved.  The tables each have a different SUPER cool picture of Phoenix.  Very nice service, and I believe they said they'd be offering 2 hours of free wi-fi if you are a paying customer.  

I've been twice now, and I liked it ok... I just didn't LOVE it.  It took me forever to write this review, as I don't have anything bad to say about it at ALL, but for whatever reason, I just can't bring myself to rave about it.   It's not especially homey, somehow, even as nice as it looks.  I'll have no problem going back next time someone says ""hey let's go to Hob Nob's"", but it's just not my first pick.

trn_2919,"I was checking on Yelp to see what restaurants were in North Phoenix that I haven't yet tried and Da Valley Grill came up. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted. I noticed they have a chalk board menu and under the breakfast items was Saimin to my delight *^_^* . Unfortunately breakfast time had already passed so I'll have to come here again to try that out. From past Yelp pics of the menu, they do change their menu from time to time since I saw bento option that wasn't available when I came that day. Which I actually like since it means I can try new things they have to offer.   So from  all the savory choices on their menu they had that day, I opted  to order the Kalua Pork and their Spam Musubi. The pork was tender and super moist. I think it needed just a tad more seasoning, but overall I enjoyed it. The Spam Musubi was just as I expected it, no rant or rave.  I also had a bit of Chicken Katsu my friend ordered. That was actually pretty good with just the right amount of breading and lightly fried and to top it off it came as 2 generous cutlets. Couple notes, if you're trying to find the place for the very first time, you might miss it as I did. The restaurant is sort of in the industrial section of that area. Also they close at 4pm during the week and are closed on Sundays.",1
trn_2920,"Monty's Blue Plate Diner is my current breakfast based obsession in Madison. The atmosphere is delightful, food is well curated and prepared, and the prices are very affordable. Easily the most well rounded ""American roots"" style breakfast we've had around town so far.

We ended up at Monty's on a Saturday morning after the farmer's market because we didn't want to wait for a table at any of the downtown options. We walked in and immediately got a seat at the bar. If you're a Yelper make sure you check in to get a free bottomless coffee!

For a main course I ordered the sweet potato hash, which came with assorted fruit, a biscuit, and eggs cooked to your liking (scrambled with copious amounts of cheese please). The was cooked to perfection with just the right about of browning on it. The eggs were not wet or overcooked. The biscuit and fruit, well, you can't really mess that up. They were great too! The coffee was about what I expected from a diner. It wasn't Starbucks (don't you dare have that expectation, you Yelper-McSnooty face), but it got the job done.

Our service wasn't AMAZING, but it was acceptable. The diner was absolutely slammed at the time because it was brunch hour so I'll let it slide. I wasn't left waiting long enough that I was hangry, and my coffee was always topped off. As far as I'm concerned service gets a check-mark in satisfactory from me.

We enjoyed the meal so much that we returned Sunday morning for brunch with an out of town friend. The second meal I had almond milk French toast with cinnamon swirl bread. The toast was perfectly dipped and not soggy with the right level of crunch to it. Unfortunately, I was still quite hungry after this plate. The portion size seemed much smaller than that of the hash the day before.

I am looking forward to my return trips to Monty's for brunch, but we absolutely need to come back to try the pumpkin bourbon cocktail shake! Cheers!",1

They've got a dog bowl for Ozzy , wifi works , they pick up the old newspapers and clear the tables . No drive thru so when I'm starting a road trip with the family I do the Lake Mead / Rampart Starbucks. Very popular with local hot moms so dress nice guys!",1

trn_2924,I keep telling this lady she's hurting me and she keeps telling me that she has to do it. So I told her maybe be a little more gentle because my feet are sensitive. Then she tells me that my feet are really bad and that I need to let her do it. So I said no- I shouldn't be in pain while doing a pedicure. So she threw her tool and said I want someone else to do my nails. And she said there was no one else so she has to finish.  I've never been in pain doing a pedicure and if they work for tips they shouldn't push me to deal with the pain if it's uncomfortable. She is STILL not understanding what SENSITIVE means. The worse pedicure experience I've EVER had!!!!!!!,-1

I would definitely come again to explore more food options and play bowling.",0
trn_2926,"No. My friend had a free room here, so we booked it just to have somewhere to shower after leaving a day club and before heading home. The elevators were really sketchy. The parking garage was dark, dirty and sketchy. Our room smelled like rotten eggs. I think the source was our clogged sink which filled up with black water. I didn't even want to shower for fear that it was the water, not the sink that was producing the black mystery substance. Everything in the room is just outdated. Carpets in the hallway are dirty. You can't tell how long anything has been there or how clean it is. Looking at the photos people have posted here freaks me out even more. Everything just sort of gave me the heebie jeebies. Maybe it is a fine place to gamble, but I wouldn't pay to book a room here. They should just tear it down and start over.",-1
trn_2927,"My first time to the Pub. I had high expectations. The service and beer selection is great. The food, schnitzel to be exact was tasteless. I went to the Schnitzel Hub several days ago and got spoiled. Some one needs to tell the chef that you can just cook pork, you don't need to cook it till its dry as a bone. Nothing could save this schnitzel. Maybe they should just stick to beer.",-1

trn_2930,"No better than any other moving company. Claimed to be full service, I was told on the phone that they could dismount my TV and move it but when the movers got there they said they have never taken a down before which lead to the rocket scientist trying and breaking my 2500.00 that I have yet to here anything from the complaint I filed.

At other times, this place is generally pretty pleasant. The food ranges from decent to excellent, the service is acceptable, but the pricing seems quite a bit higher than it should be. Recommended, but with some hesitation.",0
trn_2932,"My first ever in-n-out burger here was amazing! The line was backed up around the store but it moved very fast. As I approached the cashier to put in my order, he made great suggestions as what to order (love the staff here, very friendly and helpful). I ordered the animal style fries, double cheese burger, and a chocolate milk shake. Their portions are huge and I got all that for less than $10! What a deal! I love in-n-out and I can't wait to go back to the mainland to get me some more!! :)",1
trn_2933,"Tucked away from the many restaurants along Yonge and Finch, this is for sure one of the better kbbq places for a very reasonable price. Can get quite busy and may need to line up, and they don't take reservation. 

Came here for table cooking after hearing that they do kbbq quite well, and I have to agree. Serving size was very generous - a portion for 2 was almost enough for 3 people. We got the pork belly table cooking which was seasoned very well. TIP: you have to ask for lettuce wrap, they don't serve it with the sauce / garlic as other kbbq places do. The table cooking also came 2 bowls of rice and a tofu stew, which was quite spicy but went well to down those carbs. There's also a tonnn of side dishes they serve, which are refillable! 

If that wasn't filling enough, I recommend getting their pork bone soup! Definitely better than the majority of the MANY other korean restaurants I've been to.",1

Booked online and then the day before our arrival called just to make sure all was good. They offered to look around town to find us a room. Thought that was the point of making reservations. I'm sure if we hadn't shown up they would have still charged the credit card used to make the reservation.",-1
trn_2936,"(I personally tend to ignore Yelp reviews that are excessively swayed by one abnormal instance, but in this case, I'm WARNING potential guests about our experience.)

I've stayed at the Venetian multiple times over the past several years, and generally, it's been a reliable experience. Rooms are spacious, amenities are comfortable, the pool is relaxing, and the casino is exactly what you'd expect from one of the nicer resorts.

*HOWEVER, during my most recent stay there, a few weeks ago, I was pretty shocked to realize that four iPads among my seven guests were stolen from our room one night.  Someone managed to get into our room during the few hours it was empty, dug through backpacks and luggage to steal four iPads (even leaving the empty iPad sleeves). 

We've met and been in touch with Venetian security, and although we've given them time and patience, they haven't been much help. Maybe they aren't taking us seriously (it is Vegas, after all), or maybe they truly are just that busy to attend to a loyal customer. Even if I give them the benefit of the doubt, I URGE guests to lock up their valuables while staying at the Venetian. 

Or, you could just save yourself the worry, and try some of Vegas' other options.



Feel free to message me if you want more input.",-1

trn_2938,"Last night we were served what I would have to call one of the most amazing, innovative, and delicious meals that I have ever experienced! The service was sublime! The food was unique and exciting! And the atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and enjoyable! We started with a monstrous platter of oyster shooters which my nephew declared as ""creamy and buttery"", LOBSTER & TRUFFLES
with basil shells, pasta cooked perfectly al dente with a hint of shaved truffle was to die for, a bowl of mussels in a broth that we were soaking up with a wonderfully crunchy grilled bread, and an andouille and blistered tomato flatbread perfect for those of us who needed something other than the shellfish! We then ordered a smorgasbord of delights including the GRILLED BANH MI SHRIMP, SALMON & TUNA POKE bowl that comes with sushi rice, pickled jalapeno, and greens. The fried CALAMARI with smoked aji aioli, pickled peaches, and herbs was perfectly cooked with a slightly sweet, slightly spicy sauce drizzled on the plate to drag through. The STUFFED QUAIL was stuffed with andouille bread pudding, shishito, foraged mushrooms which melted in your mouth. We doubled up on the SCALLOPS & LATKE as suggested by our very knowledgeable and extremely attentive waiter so that everyone in our party who wanted had their own portion. It was well worth it!  We enjoyed the 
HANGER STEAK served over creamed leeks, zucchini, and pickled red onion and the FRIED OYSTERS were a sweet surprise! Lightly breaded and golden brown, one bite full of flavor. The HARMONY RIDGE DUCK BREAST with smashed potatoes finished off our own selections, again perfectly cooked to a medium as asked, juicy and tender. 
As if that wasn't enough, our ever ready waiter suggested that we sample a newly created dish that he felt was often overlooked on a menu with so much to offer and a taste treat not to be missed! The GRILLED TUNA in a dashi broth, with eggplant, smoked tomatoes, fried parsnips. He was correct! It  was sushi grade tuna perfectly cooked and the dashi broth was full flavored and briny. The pop when you bit into the whole cherry tomatoes gave an acidity that balanced with the oils of the tuna and the crunch of the parsnips enhanced the texture of the dish. Hats off to the wonderful sous chef Kordecki, who we were told created this amazing combination! 
A mixed platter of yummy desserts and coffee sealed the deal that we will be coming back for many more adventurous and delicious meals here!",1
trn_2939,"Such a cool store to shop in or just visit. The large fish tank is wondrous and cool at any age but obviously kids love it! My kiddo also loves the wildlife dioramas. 

The store is massive with a vast array of items for the outdoor enthusiast. I wish I had more outdoor hobbies just so I had more of a reason to shop here. The store is clean, organized, and employees are friendly and helpful. It's really a Christmas Wonderland during the holidays, with free Santa photos and lots of great holiday merchandise. And it's Moon pie heaven, which I was absolutely obsessed with during pregnancy LOL. 

It's in the Silverton casino so exit by the casino floor to see the Silverton aquarium, which is breathtaking!",1

trn_2942,"5 Stars for the car stereo team, Louis and Terrance.  I've purchased a hard wired cell phone charger online and not from Best Buy I had a friend install it and all of a sudden my phone wasn't charging.  Took my car to this Best Buy (because my friend moved out of state) and Terrance greeted me. He suggested that I contact the manufacturer and get a replacement after describing the problem. That night,. I ordered replacement parts and made an appointment with Terrance. On the day of install, he clearly discussed with me how he intended replace the defective product. He walked around my car identifying scratches, so I cannot claim that he damaged anything.  Took him about an hour and everything works great. He didn't rush and he even put in a fuse which my friend didn't do originally.  Fast forward a few months later. I purchased a dash camera and I  wanted it hard wired into my electrical system as well.  Called and spoke with Louis who gave me a Saturday appointment. Louis arrived exactly on time. Louis also reviewed thoroughly how I want the installation to be done. He did a safety check as well on my car.  Took him as well as Terrance about an hour to complete the installation. The price for installation is better than anyone else in town will charge.  In addition, all work is warrantied for life-time at ANY Best Buy with a mobile install center.  Terrance and Louis even refused to take a tip!   Thank you Best Buy!",1

trn_2945,"Went to IHOP with the family for a late night dessert. When we got there, the waiter went to seat us but the table he was seating us at had a sleeping kid on the seat. He had to seat is in a location that was towards the back that was empty. We were given menus but the waiter didn't come back to take our order for at least 15 minutes. We thought he forgot about us. So I stood up so he could see me when he passed by. When we ordered, we asked for a sundae and we were informed that there was no ice cream. So we ordered something else from the menu. I felt something crawling by my foot. Looked down and there was a HUGE cockroach. My son squashed it with a napkin (see picture). The food came out within a reasonable amount of time but the waiter didn't come back to check on us. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes but he never came by so we went up to the front to see if we could get his attention and pay. There was a group of 6 people there waiting to be seated. They had been there 10 minutes and hadn't been seated. When the waiter finally came out, he asked how everything was. We told him about the cockroach and he said ""I'll tell my manager"". Definitely not the response I expected. This was a horrible experience all around. I wouldn't recommend this place. They don't seem to care about customer service at all.",-1

If you are used to Vietnamese food from cities like Atlanta, D.C., or anywhere on the west coast, you will probably think this place is just OK and overpriced (it is), BUT for the crappy Vietnamese restaurant options we have locally, this is leaps and bounds better than anything else you'll find... so that is worth something. My family is Vietnamese, and when we don't feel like cooking, this is where we will typically go for Vietnamese food, if that tells you anything. :) The service can be a bit slow sometimes; that would be my only real complaint.

trn_2963,"After reading the reviews here we decided to check out Bell' Italia last night. 

As others have mentioned, its a tiny, family run place, maybe eight or ten tables total. They had the Sinatra going on the sound system, and the NY-LA game on the TV's, but the sound was turned all the way down on the game, which was good. The Sinatra was more pleasant to listen to than baseball announcers. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza (most of it for home leftovers), lobster ravioli, and ziti with meatballs. My wife had the sangria, which we all tasted. 

The food was all good. The prices were a little high compared to Vincent's, which is where we usually get Italian, but very much in line with any of the big chains. The pizza had a fairly thin crust, and was very good. The pastas, according to my wife and niece, were good. The sangria was real nice also. I'm more of a scotch and beer person and never acquired a taste for wine or wine products, so this is high praise coming from me. 

What made this place stand out was the service. Very rarely do you find a place as friendly as this. They made a real effort to help us keep our two-year old happy, bringing out some dough with a tiny little rolling pin for him to play with. They also gave us some cheesy garlic bread on the house, which we all loved. We also got the usual complementary bread and oil, of course, which was also good. 

All in all this is a really nice little place. Highly, highly recommended over chains like Olive Garden. We'll probably continue to order our carry-out from Vincent's, but when we're in the mood to go out for Italian food, Bell' Italia will be high on our list.",1
trn_2964,"As anyone can tell from my reviews, most of my time in Vegas is spent around a buffet table.  We were staying at the Mirage and decided to go downstairs to the buffet for breakfast.  We got there around 9:30 and there was no line for a Monday morning.  The inside of Cravings felt a little stuffy as it seemed like it was in the middle of the casino floor.  The décor was definitely a no fuss but that did not matter so much to me since all I wanted to do was eat food.  There was an omelet station, which was provided ready made omelets.  The guy who was making them was fast and quick and it tasted really good.  However, I did not really enjoy anything else.  The potatoes and eggs did not taste fresh and felt that it was sitting out.  Instead of trying another food item, I just got another omelet and paired it with some fresh fruit.  

I also saw the dessert area, which was surprisingly pretty big.  I tried a cookie from there and it was pretty tasty.  Overall, I think that the buffet's food is 2 stars, but I upped one star for omelet and the dessert area.",0
trn_2965,"My first experience with Hungry Howie's was 20+ years ago and had been impressed. I was pleased when a store opened nearby. The taste and value paled when compared to childhood memories. The food was extremely greasy and smaller portions than recalled. While far from my debut experience, it was tasty and decent bang for your buck. I love the option of flavored crust being complimentary as sets it apart from other ""budget"" pizza options. We enjoyed the pepperoni pizza ""roll"" but was significantly smaller than I'd remembered. It's essentially a Strombolli. Options were steak, pepperoni or chicken. Being 2 for $6, I was reluctant to order steak or chicken that can be sold that cheap. I'm a bit finicky about meat quality, but the pepperoni seemed a safe bet. That said, was impressed by the flaky, perfectly browned crust. I love pizza sauce, so ordered it with extra sauce. While tasty, the roll had very little sauce or cheese. Luckily, they sell pre-portioned sides of their sauce, so that worked out fine. Next time, I'll splurge for extra cheese as would likely improve it greatly. This time, I ordered thin crust, usually a favorite. Unfortunatley, this thin crust lacked the texture/flavor of their original or that surrounding the sandwich. Eating without a fork a challenge. It did however taste decent. The bacon, beef and mushroom were sparse, but onion plentiful. I will likely order from Hungry Howies again, but not something I can't live without. The app wasn't terribly user friendly, but they got the entire order right, even with all my ""special"" requests. Something of a rarity these days.",0
trn_2966,Don't let the name fool you- the restaurant has way more than just bagels. When you walk in you're greeted by an extensive dessert display (it all looks so good). The food menu has even more choices. The service is great and the food is delicious. The prices are relatively cheap for the generous portion sizes. Every time I've visited it's been packed which is a testament to how great the food is. I definitely recommend this place.,1
trn_2967,Have been using this place for a year for all waxing needs. I typically don't schedule far enough in advance to get the same girl each time but all the girls I have had are great. Quick and efficient.,1
trn_2968,"Ive been eye balling this place for some time after seeing they offered a dining certificate on restaurant.com.. so the Mr and I wanting to eat on the cheap headed over there. Okay, to get into this place you have to turn into the plaza behind the restaurant on Southern.. if you park in the adjacent lot on Mill you might get towed so look out. 

We did find the entrance and was greeted warmly by our server. Service here is great.. very attentive and willing to please. The food is decent enough, basic cheap Mexican fare.. taco's, burro's etc.. we shared a cheese crispy which was more like cheese limp but tasted great, like home made.. the chunky salsa they served had a nice bite and worked well with the 'limp'. Also had the red chile burro as an app.. no one can do red chile like La Canasta.. however the meat was plentiful and cooked very well. 

The Mr had the Chicken enchilada's, very good, a nice creaminess to the sauce. I splurged and had a beef chimi.. was very good and not greasy at all. 

So the food here is good but not one of those places where you feel the need to return to try more things. Please note they are only open for dinner on Friday nights otherwise this is a lunch place. Live Mariachis on Friday night as well!",0
trn_2969,"If you are someone like myself that loves Las Vegas, but doesn't care much for gambling (strange I know), this may be the place for you. This hotel is not on the strip, but within walking distance of the strip or you can take the Monorail across the street. It is a breath of fresh air! Literally, it's a smoke free hotel and might I add quiet. No bells or whistles going off as you enter to retire for the evening. The staff is super friendly; every person I encountered was more than willing to assist. They also offer complimentary breakfast every morning. Very convenient if you are going to the Convention Center, about a block away. I would definitely go back!",1
trn_2970,"These design-your-own pizza places are popping up everywhere. Even with all the options available, 800 Degrees stands head and shoulders above any other place I've visited.

This location is really nice, with high ceilings and clean decor, but the most beautiful feature of the restaurant is all of the pizza toppings! A twenty-foot-long buffet of them, I think...perfect cubes of butternut squash, fresh mozzarella, bunches of thyme, sweet roasted garlic, slices of eggplant, a variety of different hot peppers, caramelized onions, artichoke hearts, rosemary oil, on and on. 

You can choose from the list of pre-designed pizzas on the wall, or customize your own. Plus, there non-pizza options as well--salads, and burrata with your choice of accompaniments (beets and balsamic, prosciutto and melon, etc.), meatballs, broccolini.

The pizzas are perfect, though, with crisp edges and soft middles. If you like spicy, request some of their chili pepper nonsense on the side. Spicy and incredibly flavorful, almost a buffalo sauce type of thing going on. Perfect for dipping bites of crust. I love the Tartufo, with truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula.

This is pizza to enjoy when you're on your game, not the stuff you get to soak up the excess amounts of alcohol sloshing around in your stomach.",1
trn_2971,"I enjoyed my donation, frankly. Yes, it took about two hours to get to the actual donating, but it was my first time. Every staff member I encountered had a great attitude and was friendly and polite. I wish I could remember all of their names, but the lady who pricked my finger (Robin) was hilarious and made the process fun and comfortable. 

The actual donating was conducted in a professional matter by friendly staff. I feel great!

I won't name the other plasma center that I've repeatedly tried to donate at, but this one is FAR better by comparison! The other place made me wait 5 hours only to tell me that they couldn't see me that day. Today they only made me wait one hour, but I wish they had been more upfront with me. They all acted like they were fast food workers. Both times, one of the ladies complained about how hungry she was the entire time I was there. Ugh. I'm so grateful that I gave CSL plasma a try and didn't give up on the idea all together! Thanks again!",1
trn_2972,Nice cozy rooms and the staff is very helpful and friendly. Right in the heart of downtown toronto so you are very close to anything you need or want to do.,1
trn_2973,The service here is absolutely awful. Waiting over a half hour for a rice bowl is unacceptable. The product is still the same and I've liked it for over 30 years but the service has about done me in for good.,-1
trn_2974,"Pros:
-Tuna Tataki is amazing, not sure if it's limited to 1 per table though.
-Rock shrimp is also amazing, it's lightly battered fried shrimp with a sweet and salty garlic sauce
-Other cooked dishes were also properly done, although the tempura were a bit too greasy and left me feeling a bit queasy afterwards
-Sashimi is fresh and they have Tuna sashimi for dinner
-Attentive staff, great service

Cons:
-This is the deal breaker for me: the rice they used for sushi was barely seasoned, it was bland and ruined the taste of every maki we tried. The ingredients they used for the sushi were great, all fresh fish and properly prepared eel/shrimp etc but without properly prepared and seasoned rice, it just tastes like seaweed, fish & soy sauce.
-Stay away from the Philadelphia roll. They make it by using a huge chunk of regular salmon + a thin sliver of smoked salmon + a chunk of cream cheese. The sliver of smoked salmon was literally half a CM wide. Anyone who has had proper Philly roll knows that there shouldn't be anything other than smoked salmon + cream cheese, they were obviously trying to cut corners since smoked salmon costs more than fresh.

Overall, a pretty disappointing experience considering all the positive reviews here. I've tried over 10 AYCE sushi places in Toronto and this ranks in the bottom 3. It really is a shame because if only they would take the time to prepare the sushi rice properly, then I'm sure this would be the best AYCE I've ever had since almost everything else was there. 

Personally, I think I know why the rice is so bland, not only does it save time and sushi vinegar, but when we dined there, I noticed that we were the only Asian customers in the restaurant. Everyone else was Caucasian. I'm not being racist here, but maybe Caucasians prefer sushi rice to be more bland? I also noticed that all the maki were rolled inside out (rice on the outside, seaweed inside) which was invented because Caucasians didn't like the look of seaweed on the outside. Most other sushi restaurants don't bother doing this because it takes more time to prepare the rolls, so I think Sushi D does this intentionally to cater to the Caucasian clientele which is perfectly fine because they seem to be doing quite well. Just not recommended for Asian taste buds maybe :)

Bottom line: Go here if you like cooked japanese food + fresh sashimi, stay away if you like sushi or maki or anything that contains sushi rice.",-1
trn_2975,"This clinic was amazing when I got pregnant and wanted to confirm that, and didn't have insurance. No charge to me they did ultrasounds and A pregnancy test. I am not very religious and nobody shoved religion down my throat. They have an amazing program where you can take parenting classes and gain credit towards a little store with baby supplies. They also made me aware of what state programs could assist me with the pregnancy. I think it's a great place to go if you are looking for some help.",1
trn_2976,"This is a great bookstore if you are looking for a gift or even for yourself.  They have everything from religious books, top sellers, music, art, CD's.  They have a great children's section as well.

Sign up for their members reward program.  They have two of them.  One is free and the other is $25 a year.  You earn points (5 and 10% respectivly) towards merchandise.  You also get their catalog and it includes a coupon.  

I also check out their clearance section.  They have two- one for adults and one for children.  

They are always offering deals there.  If you have not been in a while I would go.  I would avoid though right before Mother's Day and Christmas.  Those are the two busiest times.",1

They can get really busy during peak hours which makes it really chaotic but it's worth the wait. My go to esthetician is a guy who works (I forget his name but I believe he is the only male employee there). What makes him amazing is how detail oriented he is and how he takes his time to make sure that he does a great job with your nails. 

P.S. If you pay in cash, they will deduct the tax

trn_2981,"Hubby and I went to City Bar B Que and it was delicious. It is located in the Ballentyne area on Hwy 521 behind the Walgreens. I ordered shredded pork, potato salad, and baked beans. There is plenty of food so we decided to take home  a peach cobbler. We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering. You can leave your dirty dishes on the table to be bussed but I usually bus my own to leave more room for the next customers. We have previously eaten at 521 BBQ and Jim n Nicks and this City Bar B Q is better than they are.",1

There were minimal meat selections, turkey or prime rib -- with plenty of gristle included. Mashed potatoes were cold and seemed to be from a box. Most food had little flavor or were overly salty. The Asian area of the buffet lacked quality and flavor. The only desert that was good was the bread pudding and the fresh fruit. The other deserts had no flavor. The gelato was gross and melted before I returned to the table. Too expense for crap.",-1

trn_2992,"What a strange experience for me. I believe there must have been a full moon out when dining here for the first time. 

We arrived for a mid week dinner.  Our friends made a reservation but I think we would've been fine.  It's a very cute and quaint dining area. We were seated immediately and someone was right over to get our drink order.  Here is where it starts to get weird.  The gentlemen with the water pitcher leaned over the edge of the table to pour everybody's water glasses.  I thought it was strange to begin with but it continued even through our meal.  I think our husbands didn't appreciate the gentlemen's tie in their food while trying to refill water.  I hope he learns quickly to refill them from the sides of the longer tables.

Continuing on...  I had ordered a Caesar Salad to begin.  It was a very generous portion.  It could've been shared with the 4 of us at our table.  I didn't finish it because of the size but it was good.  For my entree I ordered the Carbonara Truffle Risotto.  As I began to eat my meal, the chef came around to our table.  He took one look at my risotto and was very displeased.  He took it back so he could remake it the correct way.  Strange? Yes and was probably the first time that has ever happened.  But I appreciated him wanting his food to be made and presented correctly.  It was indeed much better the second time around.  

It was definitely an experience I won't forget too soon.  I am willing to try it again with hopes of the kinks all worked out.",0

trn_2994,"Cien Agaves is a funky little joint located right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. They are known for their tacos and tequilas... 15 different tacos and 100 varieties of tequila to be exact. It's casual, open late, and their menu was calling our name when my husband and I arrived in Scottsdale one recent evening.

We started with the tasty chips served with two salsas (one a mild red and the other a sweet verde) and chose a large margarita to split. There were also 16 different margaritas on the menu, and we went with The Local. The concoction of Cruz Silver Tequila, fresh squeezed lime juice, and triple sec was a hit with both of us. This place was beginning to feel like a ""choose your own adventure book"" meal and I was feeling adventurous!   

Carrying on with our adventure, it was time to pick the entree. Being that they are known for their tacos, I went with... pasta! Just kidding. I got the tacos, silly. There are three options to choose from depending on how hungry you are. You can go with a two taco or three taco meal (served with rice and black or refried beans) or a ten taco platter. With any of the three, you can mix and match your taco selections. I picked the Tinga Taco (shredded chicken breast braised in chipotle sauce, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and mexican crema in crispy corn tortilla), Pollo Asado Taco (grilled chicken breast mixed with pico de gallo, topped with guacamole in a soft flour tortilla), and Tecate Fish Taco (beer battered ono, cabbage, mango salsa, and baja sauce in a soft flour tortilla). I can't even choose a favorite, as all three were equally delicious! My husband opted for a chicken chimichanga that was filled with shredded breast meat, rice, and cheddar then topped with even more cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. It was roughly the size of a brick. I kid you not. I believe I even saw a neighboring building built out of these monsters.

After my meal, I totally feel like I chose all the right paths in my adventure book. It was so much fun, I hope to go down a few different paths sometime in the future and see where they might lead.",1

trn_2996,"I've always been curious about this place and one day my friends and I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did because this is my new spot whenever I'm in the area!

My friends and I all got different kinds of curry and they were all delicious!

But my absolute favourite from our meal is one of the apps we got the side. It was #10, Tofu Tod. I'm a big deep fried tofu lover, that's why I ordered it in particular. However, as much as I loved tofu, I could not get enough of the taro balls! It may not be a favourite for some, but definitely a favourite for me! It also came with cucumber on the side which was a refreshing to have while eating the taro, tofu and curry.

Aside from the food, the servers were so friendly! We came pretty late and lost track of time and ended up staying past closing time. We felt so bad because we realized that they were actually waiting for us to leave so they can close up for the night. But as we paid for our bill and were leaving they didn't seem bothered by it at all. They seemed genuinely happy we had a great time at their restaurant.",1
trn_2997,"After a day of shopping at the local mall and with dinner still hours off, a friend and I popped into Grazie (based on a recommendation from a former Phoenix resident) for a snack.  Didn't hurt that my hotel was just up the street.  After a quick review of the menu, pizza seemed the best option and settled on the Capricciosa (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Artichokes, Olives, Mushrooms, Salame, Ham, Parmigiano Reggian).  The pie emerged from the wood fire oven piping hot, with a slightly burnt crust.  It lasted approximately 5 minutes before vanishing into our hungry bellies.  

Wine list is all-Italian and well priced, with many by the glass selections.  I opted for a nice Barbera, which was poured generously into a large glass.

I'd be a regular if living in the area.",1

trn_3000,"I was so excited to come here after having this place bookmarked for a month or so and driving by on a weekly. My boyfriend and I finally came in on a Sunday morning and it was packed! I was so sad because I was starving and anxious for some delicious food. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and we got to stare at all of the delicious-looking pastries in the mean time.

After being seated, we browsed through the menu (which looks like a newspaper) and it was pretty hard for us to make up our mind. My boyfriend decided to get the chicken-fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and a super egg onion bagel while I got the mushroom and cheese omelet with potatoes and a jalapeño cheese bagel. 

His chicken-fried steak was delicious, he said, and the bagel was SO good. I definitely should have ordered that bagel instead because I felt that the jalapeño-cheddar bagel was lacking in flavor. It was still good, especially with their amazing cream cheese on the side, just not super flavorful.

My mushroom and cheese omelet was pretty good, cheesy and mushroomy like you'd expect. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was literally the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration there. It was delicious. 

The service was quick and super friendly! After we ate, even though I was so full that I was bursting at the seams, we went to go get pastries. We splurged. We got raspberry, coconut lemon, blueberry, and apple cinnamon rugalach as well as a ""mini"" eclaire, chocolate dipped macaroon, chocolate dipped Florentine, and raspberry linzer tart. We devoured all of those within 2 days of going there. No regrets... Besides not buying the coconut cream cake and almond horseshoe but we're saving those for next time! :D coming back soon!!",1

trn_3002,"We would never ever booked TheHotel again. 

This Thanksgiving was my second time been there. The only reason I booked TheHotel again was because my father loved the decroation of the room.  (From my opinion, the decroation is more like a business hotel...)

When we entered the room, everything was perfect until I found a dark brown stain on the quilt. GROSS!Then I saw stain on the carpet, too. That was very obvious both stain were caused by same stuff which I don't know what that was. They were looks very disgusting! I called room service right away. They didn't apologize and used monotone to notified me that they would send someone to change it. They sounded not surprised at all. That's ok, I didn't want this ruin my vacation, so  we just left the room and tried to havesome fun.

I was the first one trying to take a shower; however, before I turned on the water, I saw HAIR on the drain!!!! GROSS GROSS GORSS GROSS !!! I was way too tired to do anything about it, so I didn't call the room services. If I called, I think the only thing they would do is probably using same monotone to tell me that they would send someone up and pick up the HAIR!?

trn_3005,"This place was amazing! Super phenomenal customer service, nice atmosphere, and good food!

First, I'll talk about the pizza. They were able to split the two we wanted into one pie! Yay! We got buffalo chicken and meat lovers. Both were delish and they were not timid with toppings. The buffalo chicken pizza had a great buffalo sauce on it. The meat lovers has pastrami on it! 

The wings were super crispy, but not overly greasy. They gave the medium sauce on the side, so that you could pour it yourself or use it as a dip. This is the 1st place I have been to that does that.

The garlic knots were good also. Lots of oil or butter at the bottom, but whatever makes it taste yummy, right?! Ha! I think these could have had more garlic on them, but we still ate them all. 

I haven't tried the other stuff, so I'll be back!

For an appetizer, we shared the family seafood platter which contained grilled calamari, scallops and fried calamari.  It was ok.  Nothing special other than a little olive oil marinade on top.  We also had the spinach appetizer which was way too runny and the chips were 'meh.  Overall, I left unimpressed.  The menu has been the same for years.

+ As a build-your-own-burger place, you can satisfy pretty much anyone you want to bring. Even your vegetarian, gluten-free, spice-loving friend will be able to make something that suits them. 
- This place can get really crowded (especially for the Tuesday night deal), and it's seat yourself, so come early or you might have some wait. There's upstairs seating too, and a bar!
- Service is kind of hit or miss. It seems like the staff is always rushing around, so don't expect much individual attention unless you flag them down. 
+ The burgers and toppings have always been on point for me! 
+ The $3 half-pound burger on Tuesday from 9PM-midnight is AMAZING. 
+/- I've split a milkshake from here with a friend once. Trust me, even as someone with a sweet tooth, I found it to be quite a lot of sugar. Make sure you've got room if you're getting a burger too, or split it many ways.

When I arrived back from a late night trip from California, I left a very expensive pair of headphone in the enclose center council of my rental car.

It was understatement to say, I was dead tired from that trip, and I crashed hard for few days to get back into the swing of things.  When I realize, my headphone were missing, I had to re-tracked my steps; then ran back down to Enterprise a few days later.  When I got there, this Henderson location was busy, and I just waited a few minutes.  When I got to the counter, the same dude who rented the car to me.

I can respect the fact that this bar is able to heard a ton of people in on Wednesday nights for ladies night! I guess they can give thanks to reputation for that! I mean who would want to see groups of pretty cowgirls, while getting the opportunity to have a ice cold beer for only 50 cents??! Wednesdays is usually always a fantastic time here!!

Ok... Lets move on back to the DJ.. When you announce, ""if you have a request let the DJ know."" Make sure you play the damn song! I don't know how many times I have tried to help the DJ put some flare into is performance, and then they never follow through.. His loss not mine. No offense but I have been to more country bars then Miley Cyrus's father, and I have seen more a** than a toilet seat.. I think I know by now what would make the speakers go, ""BOOM BOOM!"" 

FireBall lovers... On a good note.. Fireball shots are only $3 on Wednesdays night! More the reason to visit this place for Ladies night! 

I didn't want it to come to this topic... But Fellas... If you're going to have a wet T-Shirt contest.. Make sure the ladies you select or shall I say sign up, are present able! I understand the demographic area is horrible but, please have some sort of criteria without sacrificing legalities of discrimination! Besides.. The Wet T-Shirst contest is getting old! Perhaps you should invest into a stripper pole, that retracts in the middle of the dance floor and have pole contest... Take my word for it you would have a niche on all these other country bars that are stealing not only your lighting but, also your thunder! Just food for thought really! Hint hint...

Other than that.. Keep up the good work! Really appreciate the friendly staff!

A note to CVS on Val Vista and Williams Field: If you want client retention and customer satisfaction, at least pretend to be nice to your customers and offer suggestions or help. Pharmacy Manager: Do NOT cuss out loud and talk about another customers information to a pharmacy technician, period. It's ignorant and will land you with a lawsuit and another career-hopefully not in customer service.",-1

trn_3048,"Description of the job: 
Keystone installed carbon fiber / epoxy foundation wall reinforcement straps on the walls of two adjacent properties. For one property they also demolished a poor condition finished wall. Prior to this work, two evaluation technicians visited the properties to provide observation and planning info. Throughout the process Keystone was available and helpful when responding to questions and changes in my intent and availability dates for the installation.

Summary of their work: 
It went very well. A multi person team arrived promptly on the day of the installation. The guys were friendly, clean, and professional. The amount of time taken for the work and their cleanup/ footprint was very impressive. The foreman was responsive to calls before installation day and questions on the day of.

Overall I was very pleased with all of the team members that I interacted with. They were very available over the phone and in person on occasion. I would suggest a few things upfront, 1. if you are looking for a structural engineering evaluation of the home, I'd suggest going that route before contacting Keystone. 2. I wouldn't skew their first impression by setting the context of work you think  needs done.. let them come, make observation and then determine a path for the work.

I'd recommend this company to friends and family.",1

trn_3052,"Alright, we all know that I am a huge fan of the Real Canadian Superstore - and not just because it's really Canadian.

Pros:
1. Humongous!

2. They have a good sized Joe Fresh smack in the middle (meaning you can sneak clothing into your grocery budget without anyone really noticing - score!)

3. They have the housewares section - which I love - you can find everything you need and things you didn't even know you needed!

4. Apparently they have the low-price guarantee or some nonsense.  There were so many signs telling me to ""TRUST OUR PRICES"" that I did, indeed, trust their prices.

5.  They have a Beer Store & some sort of wine store on site.

Cons:

1. It's just too big, I spent about 10 minutes wandering around looking for eggs.  For pete's sakes, EGGS!  I actually left without buying any because I couldn't find them and was getting angry text messages from the mister who was waiting in the car.

2. The organic section was hidden.  I wandered up and down the store for a good 15 minutes looking for this.  I almost had a meltdown trying to buy my organic soy milk.

3. Too. Many. People.  Arrgghhhhhh!  And they move so freakin' slow.  Why? Why? WHY?  It totally gave me the rage.

4. We followed the signs to leave the store, and got lost in a neighborhood called Flemington Park.  We actually had to whip out the GPS to get the hell out of here.  It was like being in a Kasbah.  People were laughing at us, I could tell.

Anyways, if I need some ""real Canadian""ness I suppose I'll come back here because it's so close to our place - but I may need to put myself into a sensory deprivation tank afterwards.",0
trn_3053,"This is easily the worst In-N-Out anywhere in the country. Forget about the average service and complete lack of hospitality (which you get in spades in most other In-N-Outs), what does this location in is pricing. You will easily pay 30%-40% above standard In-N-Out prices for the same food. I get that the location is in a tourist mall on the Vegas Strip, but when you go to the Starbucks in the same location you pay standard national pricing. If a megalith like Starbucks can do it, why can't a Christian company like In-N-Out do the same?",-1

I adopted a severely neglected 8-year-old toy poodle about a month ago. I made the huge mistake of changing her food too quickly which led to gastric distress and both the dog & me paying for it. She got the ""runs"" and I had to clean it up for over a week. 

I actually stopped in to make a grooming appt. My vet's staff recommended Barking Dogs for grooming. I was warmly greeted by Kathy and the other staff. I must have looked really stressed because she asked me about my dog. The flood gates opened and Kathy took the time to visit with me about nutrition and what I needed to do to get Annie's gastrointestinal issues settled. She recommended pumpkin, an herbal supplement to mix in, raw goat's milk and food by Fromm. Within 12 hours Annie's issues were resolved! I was so relieved. Barking Dogs and Kathy are my hero! 

Today, I took Annie in for her first grooming. I could not be more pleased! Stephanie did a great job! Very caring and Annie looks fabulous. 

It's obvious that Kathy & her staff are caring pet lovers. Do yourself and your pet a favor and patronize Barking Dogs. If you do, you'll be super happy and so will your pet.

The food! I went with the mornin Monte, which turned out only to be the BEST breakfast sandwich I have ever had!! Turkey, havarty, bacon and egg whites nestled between French toast, layers upon layers of deliciousness. That would have been the perfect sandwich in itself.

I blame it on those establishments - one time my best friend started making out with his future girlfriend which iced me out his life, and another time I got so sick I thought it was time to get someone to read me my last rites. But hey, you know what they say, the twentieth time is the charm!

Silver is next level chill. You remember those gum commercials where a guy had a blast of cool hair hit him in what seemed like a Cold War missile silo? It's that level cool. The staff is hands on, but not. The people are respectful and friendly, but know when you want to just have time with your crew. Like, you go here with a few of your closest individuals, start that hookah, and you feel like a sheikh. 

I had given up on hookah to be honest. I had embarrassed myself by not knowing what the mouthpiece was for and got laughed at. We all gotta start somewhere guys. But this place, I feel like if I had gone on one of those aforementioned embarrassing moments, especially the one with my best friend, we could have salvaged our relationship.

I ordered mama's biscuits with fried chicken. It was pretty good but much smaller than I had expected. I also split an order of deviled eggs with my dining buddy. It was more than enough for me, others may want to add additional item.

My chicken seemed to be slightly overcooked, and the advertised katsu sauce was not the type to which I am accustomed.  That being said. It was still tasty.  The fries were excellent, well cooked and seasoned.

So, why 4* when my sandwich was just good, not great?  Well, several things.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The decor was very cool.  Heck, having Ultraman on the ceiling is virtually worth 1* by itself.  They have WiFi.  And, I'll definitely go back again.  We'll see if the rating changes at that point.",1

When i first went there, even though I loved the rocks and fossils, I found that its curb appeal was a lot more rugged.  It makes sense, because their business isn't only rocks, it is all the equipment to work with them, such as tumblers and other ""rock type"" equipment.

As years have passed, when I walk in there, it seems that their displays are getting more on par with other local competitors.  It is turning into not only an awesome supplier (it always has been), but it is also a very beautiful space.

So if I am so full of compliments, why 4 stars instead of 5?

Where I docked a star was on the jewelry making supplies.  Their jewelry for purchase is outstanding, but their supplies for making jewelry is quite dated.  I understand that is not their core business, so no judgement from me.  I will keep going!

I would say that nearly all of books I've finished have come from the Cleveland Public Library (CPL).  Not only is its catalog extremely vast, but if for some reason they don't have what you're looking for, they will find it.  Best of all, I can request books online and get an email telling me when my books are ready for pick up, and a reminder telling me they're due in two days.  One of my favorite ways to spend a lunch hour in the spring, summer and fall is with a book (from the CPL) in the reading garden, with my fellow Clevelanders around me.  Definitely one of the best spots in downtown.",1

While I understand that's very convenient for a busy elementary school teacher, I just don't get what she sees in it beyond that. It's a convenient location, although the parking lot is inadequate at peak hours due to the dead-end drive thru. The interior is very neat with all the wood trim. The employees were very nice and helpful. But that's about it for the Pros. If the food were better, I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. It's not horrible food, but The Perfect Pear is far superior. it's just basic food, dressed up in a really nice setting. I got their signature dish - Croque Monsier.  First time to a restaurant, I always try to get a dish it's famous for. I really didn't see what the big deal was. It's basically a Monte-Cristo-type warm sandwich, no different than Chompies. My big complaint is when restaurants make these ''elite' sandwiches and the insides (meat, cheese, etc) are a big lump in the middle and the rest of the sandwich is plain bread because they couldn't take the time to actually spread out the ingredients so you'd get a good bite every time. The second big issue is since it's warm/heated, as it sits on the plate, the bottom can get soggy. Mine must have been sitting for a while because the bottom of the bread was mushy. Yuck. So their 'signature dish' was fairly tasteless, I had to spread the insides around with my finger, and it was soggy on the bottom. Triple Yuck. The pasta salad side was really good but the meal was already on the downside by that time. Or course I have a very small sample size of one visit and one dish, but it WAS a signature dish. Since my wife loves it, I'm sure I'll be going back, so I'll try the crepes next time and hopefully have better luck.",-1

I would have liked a little more heat from the Sriracha mayonnaise and a softer texture for the brioche bun, but those technicalities were overshadowed by the overall flavor of the sandwich. 

In terms of environment, this location is small, with limited seating. There was also a pretty long line when we arrived at about 8:30 in the morning. Service is typical counter service.

Although the food is great, it's also very overpriced for the portion you get. $12 for a breakfast sandwich the size of my fist? While the price would prevent me from visiting often, I think every now and then, when I'm feeling rich, I'd like to stop by for a delicious egg creation.",1

Was greeted with a hello and a beautiful smile by a bar tender named Emily.  WOW!!  Total stunner!!  Asked me what I would like and told here I was craving a margarita.  She worked her magic and had one in front of me in no time.  And it was pretty good too.  After one sip I knew there would be a second.  

Emily asked me if I wanted to see a menu so I said ""sure"".  After looking at the menu for a few minutes I thought everything sounded pretty good.  Emily helped explain the menu.  When I asked for a suggestion, she said the mahi tacos and enchiladas were winners.  So I took her advice and found she was right on the money.  Enchiladas were really good and mahi mahi has always been one of my favorites.  Thanks for the tip Emily.

This was my first time going to the Cheesecake Factory for Sunday brunch. They serve brunch until 2pm and I was excited to give it a try. 
We had a large party of 9 people so it's always hit or miss for good service. Our waiter was very personable and friendly. He was knowledgeable about the menu. I appreciated that there was a nice amount of brunch options, but not too many so as to overwhelm you. 
My husband and I both ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was cooked perfectly and had a perfect dusting of powder sugar. The chicken prepared with it was about 5 or so chicken tenders which were arranged beautifully on the plate. HOWEVER, the chicken had no seasoning on it at all. So we requested hot sauce and we were brought Tabasco sauce relatively quickly. Then, I requested a glass of water, and I never received it. This is when our service took a turn for the worse as the restaurant got more busy. My husband even asked for a refill on his coffee, and the cup was full of coffee grounds. He nicely requested another and it returned the exact same way. I'm not sure if they were out of coffee filters or what! 
So the food was okay per usual. But the service started off awesome and ended poorly as we waited quite a while for our checks. That being said, the young man seemed to be trying his best, but his section was way too large for just one server. 
For the location and atmosphere that this restaurant tries to create, they have got to do better with staffing and service in order to have repeat customers.",0
trn_3092,"The place was so hospitable for a group from soccer. We had a group on 13 adults and 7 kids come in for lunch. Outstanding BBQ and service! So much so we went back that night and had dinner! We told the other team parents this is a spot from now on- we need to come back to again and again. Wings are to die for! Many flavors to choose from and the beer is quite tasty too! My husband and I both had the brisket sandwich and a bowl of yummy onion soup. My dinner choice was homemade mac n cheese, coleslaw and cornbread that I could have eaten a dozen muffins. Another parent had the BBQ mixed platter and could barley finish it! Everyone raved about the onion rings as well. Too many good things to choose from on the menu. We will eat here every time we're in town with our soccer team. Not a single complaint from either meal in our group!",1
trn_3093,"Wado has been amazing for us. The environment is very friendly and welcoming, not intimidating. My 5-year-old son very much loves these classes and is getting individual attention from the instructor every day. She helps him learn new self-defense techniques each class and he has so much fun. She works with him at his skill level, and allows each child to advance at their own pace. The teacher is incredibly good with kids. My son earns new belt stripes every time he remembers a new karate rule or term which he is excited about. He sleeps better at night because he gets such a good workout in. I have tried other karate/MMA classes in town for him, and we had very poor experiences. I am so relieved that we found a place who we can trust and enjoy. Wado is genuinely committed to customer satisfaction and have been delightful to work with. We will keep our son enrolled for as long as he wants!",1

I did order a pork bun as I wanted to try the sweet and salty that the waiter discussed but my order got messed up and was happy to try the beef.

Although I live in Houston about 240 miles from Mesquite - my car has been sitting out somewhere in Mesquite for over one week - attempts to communicate with these folks ""IMPOSSIBLE"" - too late now  but my eyes bulged when my 45 year old son showed me the BBB rating of ""F"" with 230+ recent complaints - some folks on another internet forum accuses them of sabatoge and unauthorized possession of motor vehicles - pleasure driving - damaging - vandalism - even theft.

trn_3099,"Best chicken this side of the Mississippi. I Grew up with KFC and churches chicken. Then along came Popeye's chicken over here  with a Cajun spice. Was mighty good for a while. However, they were all over cooked and to salty, too greasy.Then I seen a post about this new outfit called Bush's Cicken coming to Gilbert. I thought it was another run of the mill, deep fried greasy chicken outfit. Needless to say, Bush's chicken does it right each and every day. Cooked to perfection, not too salty, not too greasy and super tender.
 Anyone out there that eats KFC often or any other fried chicken fast food joint.
 Please give Bushs a try and you will not be disappointed. They even have baked chicken for those who don't want the high cholesterol fried option. And believe me the baked option is Good as Gold.",1

trn_3101,"first off, this is not a very healthy place to eat. now that that has been said, the workers here are just so great! they all greeted me and every customer in front of me. they were thorough in explaining the menu to me which i appreciated on my first visit. the food was quite delicious as well, altho definitely not healthy and quite heavy actually. i felt a major food coma after what i thought would be a somewhat healthy meal. i ordered my enchiladas without cheese and sauce on the side but their mashed potatoes had a lot of butter in them. also, the ambience of the place was quite comfortable for a fast food joint. it had a nice open view of the street and parking lot and brought in a lot of natural sunlight which i really liked. the only issued i had with the place was there was a girl worker there who shouted at everyone. maybe she was hard of hearing, but it really got on my nerves spending 30 minutes there trying to enjoy my meal when she was talking so uncontrollably loud. the manager was behind her at one point and never said a thing. the workers must have gotten used to her loud mouth. overall, i would come back here again.",1
trn_3102,"I'll admit it, I did not want to like this place because it took Palate away. But we went for Saturday dinner and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be super cheesy (really... with a name like Local Breeze?! Really?!) Thank goodness there was no Jimmy Buffett playing or we would've gotten the heck outta dodge. The music was good, but the atmosphere was missing something. Oh, and people. It was missing people. The place was practically empty! On a Saturday night. Uh oh. Too bad, cause the patio is really nice and they offer s'more makings over their fire pit (what... $7 is a bargain for that...right?) There is also a bean bag toss game (thank goodness for free) with a bar right next to it ($5 Kiltlifters... hmm...) 

This place has potential, but needs to work out the kinks. Why the bathroom is dirty when the restaurant is empty is beyond me. Seriously guys, are you too busy to clean that up? 

The food: The pork chops were a miss compared to everything else ordered. The tilapia (lemon) was yummy and the broccoli was perfection. The lavosh was solid to start. The fish tacos were good. The clear winner of the night was the Fire Island sandwich. It was freaking good and I will be back for it. Hopefully there will be other people there as well.",0
trn_3103,"Setting:  This quick eatery is located near our home in the Happy Valley shopping center.  Out of all the eateries in this area, my wife and I rank this place above the rest.

Ambiance:  Space is very limited although there is seating outside.  Typical fast food ambiance for take out or sit down.  However, it is not the ambiance that matters here, but the food is delicious!

Food/Menu:  My wife ordered the chicken kebab meal that comes with a drink and fries ($8.50) while I ordered the ultimate steak shawarma (sandwhich only $6.95, and you can also choose chicken).  We added 2 garlic sauces that cost $0.50 each.  Depending on how many people are there, the food does not take very long to come out.

Chicken Kebab - the chicken is seasoned well with great flavor, while the veggies and added garlic sauce in the pita bread compliment the meat.  The french fries are thick and are not too soft or too crunchy.

Ultimate Shawarma - the bread seems buttered with the right amount of crunch when you bite into it.  The steak, with the onions, tomato, and provolone combined make for a definite party in your mouth.  Tasty and savory sandwich.  This is a definite after party or late night treat!

Service:  They are family owned and do an excellent job of service.  No complaints!

Overall:  The prices were listed above due to the fact that you are getting quality sit down Greek food at a reasonable price.  I have not tried the whole menu yet, as I have not gotten sick of the shawarma.  Overall, this is better than average Greek food with a good price.  Out of all the eateries here, we will definitely be seeing you again Greek Pita!",1
trn_3104,"As someone who's half-Spanish, lived in Spain with a mom who cooked this type of cuisine on a regular basis most of my life let's just say my expectations were pretty high for a place with this type of hype.

First off, the place is very pretty! Ideal for a fancy meal or a special moment. It's a very busy setting with not a whole lot of room between you and other tables. To say they have optimized seating would be a fair statement. Atmosphere is great and for people who love trendy, this is the place to be. Looking for Romance, this isn't it! Looking for family setting, definitely not it! This is a place to be seen, a place to have an adventure!

We ordered the following plates and here are my impressions :

Charcuteria Plate : This plate consists of Iberian ham, chorizo, salami, olives, etc. It's a small tapas portion with EXACTLY 4 slice of everything. Priced at $22, I found the value in this plate low. I love these type of plates so I was looking forward to it... and.... and it was just fine, nothing really wowed me. Who would have known I needed more than 2 tiny slices of chorizo to have enough to have a tangible impression? (2/5)

Octopus & Sweet Potatoes : Very good, tapas style but good enough for 2 people. (4/5)

Patatas Bravas : Good but not that great, portion is somewhat small so sharing it for 2 was a stretch. It's potatoes people, give us more. (3/5)

Paella for 2 ($50) : Our main course. I won't lie, it's was pretty damned good and the quality of the sea food was top tier. Rice was cooked to perfection. Excellent dish but what's up with the $50 price-tag? Greedy!! (3/5)

Churros : To even consider the portion tapas style would be a joke. You get 2 tiny churros ($2 each) with a tiny bowl of chocolate to dip it in. Churros was crispy on the outside, inside was under-cooked. This was prepped sloppily. (1/5)

Service was very good, a little impersonal but did their job quite well. I'm always a little off when more than 2 waiters are passing by and attending my table. Not sure who to talk to and during this particular meal no less than 4 wait staff stopped by our table.

All in all, the food was well below my expectations and I'm still looking for an ideal Spanish resto in Montreal. Tapeo did not provide what I was looking for and with the price-tag being what it was, I felt it had low value.",0

I think this is a set up for tourist because i have went into the regular mall and some of the prices are the same. How can it be the same if one is a discount store. I think they need more variety in food at this outlet both food courts have similar foods you would think with 2 food courts there would be more options to pick from. The stores are always busy, but the nice thing is they keep the shelves stocked. I like this location better than the north location because it's indoors so on hot days you only have to go outside for a few stores but the majority it indoors.",0

(Is there an F.U. icon of a hand with a finger up by any chance?  Because I'd gladly give them 5 of those.)  HOURS of waiting as one of the FIRST people in line followed by HOURS of more waiting AFTER the club had already opened due to letting people in who were further down the line.

Upon entering, there was no greeter and when the greeter finally came, she was not really a bubbly or cheery person. After being brought to our table, it took forever for the server to come. 

Everything from here wasn't too bad, we order an appetizer to start - the baked goat cheese. Wasn't that great... Anyways, onto the entrées - my girlfriend ordered a pasta and for myself, a burger. The pasta was average, nothing special. Burgers like the one I ordered can be compared to ones like at moxies or pickle barrel because they're just a burger with a fancy name cooked well done and with a side, except this one tasted terrible. I don't know who thought some sliced smoked ham would taste good in a burger - terrible combination.

The only thing that was a little more than decent was the server refilled my drink quickly.

trn_3142,"I am not a Cirque fan. Truth be told I grew up in Canada and have seen many Cirque productions and they frankly scare me. The crazy clown/ juggling, Miming, high flying trapeze , acrobatic contortionist acts never appealed to me. Not one bit. But yet I found myself in love with LOVE.

LOVE is a gorgeous interpretation of the songs of the Beatles. The production captures the spirit of the Beatles. It's visually stunning, and it envelops you, encircles you. It becomes overwhelming at points with the amount of action happening all around. You really have to sit back and take in the beauty of it all. Don't blink -you'll want to see it all. The sound and staging were spectacular. 

There isn't really a story so much as there are themes. It revolves around Beatles era references: the Cold War, beatles-mania,the 50's, the 60s, their crazy acid induced trips into Sgt Pepper territory and their foray into India are all referenced in a dazzling way. 

I particularly loved how they interpreted Black Bird, the yellow Submarine was amazing and surprising and of course, beautiful (especially viewed from the top).

Cleaniness: unlike other Chinese bakeries that reuse the trays and tongs, they do clean it before reusing

Cost: range from about $ 2.90-5$ for buns- I didn't check the pastries

Taste:  bought the Earl grey twist, matcha red bean bun and it tasted great.

Value and would I come back:  probably not - the price seems a bit inflated.  For a one time experience for breakfast or snack, it's not a bad idea.",0

I had different thermostats installed (WiFi enabled) when the house was built, but they were installed by a 3rd party.  Sierra tech checked out the heater and it was fine.  He was hesitant to work on the thermostat since his company didn't install them, but I opened it up and he checked the wiring.  It was wired incorrectly.  Tech corrected the wiring and all's good.

My first visit was...well...ok. Nothing amazing to say the least but did bring a smile 'cause it was THE Heart Attack Grill. 

Burger - was actually pretty good. I got the double-bypass cheese burger which I killed in 10mins. Should have gotten the triple. It came nicely put together and I added tomato, pickles, red onions, and mustard

Fries - ....eh. sounds amazing fried in lard, but was under par for me. was kinda limp, wasn't crispy and i think the few batches that were in the tray were over cooked. loved the fry bar concept though.

Experience - wasn't as expected, granted that we went for lunch on a Tues, the waitresses weren't exactly ""hot"" (like on TV...LOL) they were very friendly and attentive tho. I would think the best times would be more the weekends. if you want that experience and ""eye-candy""

if you love burgers...like experiencing themed places. definitely check this place out at least once. i hope to return one day... on a weekend.

I had the philly cheese steak and my mom had the shrimp Po boy.  The philly had lots of onions and peppers and a queso cheese which gave moisture to the whole sandwich and made it great.  The fries were fresh and soooo good.  Usually fries are just a mediocre afterthought but these were medium sized, spicy, and crisp. Great service.  I would like to go back for more of a night time bar visit.  They had a whole menu of cool shots to order.",1

My only complaint is once the waitress told me the dishes incorrectly which led to someone with dietary restrictions eating something they shouldn't have 

Definitely get the pork soup dumplings!",1
trn_3155,"As an MMA fighter, I absolutely love request a test.  I've used them twice already and they're awesome.  Very convenient.  They know exactly what blood work you need per state, they will automatically fax over your results.  You can create an account and your results are online for download anytime.  You can pay over the phone and go to a LabCorp or something like that, super easy.


Highly recommended!",1
trn_3156,"This is, by far, the worst excuse for a medical facility that I have encountered. They repeatedly treated me with condescension, lost my appointments multiple times (I even paid for childcare to come in one weekend that they assured me I would be seen, only to be told I wasn't on the calendar), failed to get me in their patient portal despite multiple requests, refused follow up testing on key health concerns that were totally covered by my insurance and tried to guilt me into giving my infant daughter an immunization I had sincere reservations about. In addition, their bedside manner is atrocious. I saw three different caregivers (trying to give this center the benefit of the doubt) and all were impersonal, hurried, and had no concern for my children or myself. I encourage anyone to avoid this place at all costs. They only want to check the box to get your copay and force you into using their onsite lab.",-1
trn_3157,"Wow. 

Really good food. Really good. 

The sausage calzone I saw at the next table looked amazing. Next time. 

My pasta - 3 -4 times now - always al dente', always delicious. Good meatball too and the whole dinner portion gets a really nice Italian salad. 

The IL Purista is a sandwich, but calling it a sandwich, like Subway, is just silly.  It is amazing!  Get this:  Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Tomato, Roasted Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Balsamic Vinegar. Sheesh. 

Every bite is amazing. One bite you get the peppers, next the mozzarella and basil...all on a base of prosciutto...oh my God is this good. The whole sandwich, as opposed to the 1/2, is $10. 1/2 now, 1/2 for dinner. Sooooooo good!

I don't give many 5 stars, Del Falco's gets 5+ from me!",1

We just had dinner at Chimney Fresh and it was delicious!. Each dish was made to order. We had the Kerala porota, king fish fry, beef ulliyarthiya (beef dry fry), mutton biryani, chicken dosa - crispy, samiya paysam and 2 Madras coffee. 

The fish fry was crisp, with a hint of spice and just fresh and delish. i had read reviews on the porota and have had porota in many restaurants but nothing compares to the flavor here..reminded me of home! Chicken and dosa, not a flavor I expected to go together...the spicy chicken with a hint of sweetness pared so well with the crispy dosa. The mutton biryani, paysam and coffee were all authentic and flavorful. 

Overall, the dishes and the vibe here was warm and friendly. The owner, George and Jobi were inviting and pleasant and passionate about the business. George came out to check on us and the meal...he explained that all their spices are made in house including their clarified butter...crazy right in the most awesome way! A night that was a let's just check this place out turned into an amazing foodie delight! Looking forward to going back with more of my fam and friends",1

I am a former server, and let me tell you, he was amazing. He was genuinely nice and caring and was always on top of things. Just seemed like really great guy and he made my fiancés birthday a great one. He even brought out two deserts at the end! I judge a lot of places based on the service, and the service was definitely 5 star! Thanks, Brayden!",1
trn_3162,"Just been here for lunch. We ordered a sashimi lunch box, chicken cutlet soup udon, soon tofu and an avocado roll. Bento box was ok, rice a bit hard. The soup udon was ok but would have preferred the cutlet on the side and not getting soggy in the soup. The avocado roll was ok. The best dish was the soon tofu, surprisingly. It was beef and seafood. Had some beef, 2 shrimp, 1 mussel, diced squid and baby scallops. Broth was tasty and spicy. Great on a cold day like today.  Tofu could have been silkier.
Service was ok, not a smile until we had paid the bill and she saw a $5 tip. 
Parking here is really bad because of all the medical offices they have here, that use the same car park.  I would say it's ok for a bite to eat, if you're in the area but not so great that I'd come back especially to eat.",0

trn_3164,"I don't like her at all.  She's real confrontational and does not care if something is bothering you whatsoever.  If you tell her something that's bothering you, she'll blink at you once, say one sentence then move on.  

The appointment lasts for all of 5 minutes.  She takes your blood pressure with a wrist cuff that she makes you place near your heart so it will register.  She then weighs you on a scale she bought from Walmart.  She writes a few things down in her notes, gives a RX w/only 2 refills, then sends you on your way.  She doesn't even bother to make an appointment in advance three months later so you can get your meds refilled on time.  

She does things the old fashioned way, as in paper 'scripts that you have to physically take to the pharmacist, old school pencil appointment books, etc--absolutely nothing is done electronically as with most medical offices.  Having to call in a RX refill is quite the fiasco since you have to leave her the pharmacy's phone # and location (evidently she can't or won't look it up on Google if the wrong # is accidentally given), your bday, what medication you need, the dosage amount, etc.  Doesn't she have record of that?!  The answer is yes, but she can't be bothered to look it up.  She is a bit difficult to get in touch with.

She also charges MD prices when she's just a nurse practitioner.",-1

The dumplings are made in house... Delicious!!!!",1
trn_3167,"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!",1
trn_3168,"I've been a member on this gym for over 2  years..I've always looked forward on going and I even referred some of my friends & family to check out this place. The place is intimate unlike LVAC or LA Fitness with so many members that you have to wait until someone has finished with the machines. Before, the staff are always very helpful and they ALWAYS keeps the gym clean. They always make sure the machine are always working, even if they go down it get gets fixed within a week or so. But now for several months now the gym has gone downhill with the quality over all!  Why? Multiple machines are out of service! Why bother putting a sign that the machine is going to get fixed on a certain date when it never happens! Keep in mind the gym is a small facility so there a very limited amount of machine that's available. Allowing your facility to have multiple machines that's not working is simply unacceptable. I really don't mind paying a little more before because the previous team was on it but now I really see the difference, most of them are too busy on their phone or on the computer.  The place is always dirty now, trash all over the place and the dirty towels are all over the place. A lot of times there are no clean towels available when before this was never the case.  The mirror are not being cleaned, keep in mind I'm not talking about afterhours, I'm taking about during the day! If this continues I will end up switching across the street! This should be an easy fix, hire someone that wants to work not someone that looks miserable behind the desk! I just want a clean gym and machine that works!

Aside from the food taking 30 minutes to come out, three of the five meals came out wrong and it took another 15 minutes to get the right order. By the time the rest of us got our food, everyone else was done eating. On top of that, our waters were empty before our food even showed up and when we tried to get the attention of another server (Kirsten). She made direct eye contact with us and walked right passed us. We finally went up to speak to a manager and his exact words were ""what do you want?"". All in all, worse service I have ever experienced. The manager did take off one of the meals and discounted our checks, but it didn't make up for our poor service.",-1
trn_3171,"A random craving for schnitzel brought a friend and I to Little Bavaria. Located in a plaza at Eglinton and Markham, it wasn't what I expected when I entered; it was completely decorated like a German pub. So festive! White linens and flags everywhere! 

We seated and scoured the menu. There's meat with more meat and a side of meat. Even though the menu has a lot of meat, there ARE vegetarian options. Sweet! I went with the Jäger Schnitzel($18.95). It has a red wine sauce with mushrooms and onions. My friend went with the Bavarian Plate($22.95). It comes with schnitzel, kassler and krainerwurst. Both came with soup or salad and 2 sides. SO MUCH FOOD. The schnitzel was ok, a little fatty though. The Bavarian Plate was good! I had a taste and it was pretty good.

Know what else is good about German restaurants? German Beer! I got myself a pint of Erdinger and enjoyed my meal! They also have a selection of German wines and spirits. A nice change from regular restaurants. 

The service was good. It wasn't busy and one server was working. There was a large party there, but it didn't affect the speed of our food or service. The food was cooked fresh to order.",0

Who examined the basics like fluids, belts, and tires without being asked and without charging more for it. Who gave you an estimate and then came in under it. Who made you feel like their pricing was thoughtful and reasonable. Who made you believe that you weren't being gouged. Who explained line items and highlighted the important things on the bill before you paid for the repairs. Who wasn't condescending to women as if we know nothing about cars.

If you are a fan of eggs benedict I would recommend this dish.  My husband had the Tocula pizza.  Which was very savory.  The menu indicated the pizza was spicy but the spice was more derived from the chorizo and a little kick of jalapeño.  Not as spicy as expected and very good.  On top of the delicious meal we recieved a frequent visitor card which gave us 10% off, which we can use on our future visits.  I'm not sure if everyone gets one of those cards or how it works.  Definitely try Scramble if you want Breakfast that is above ordinary.  We can't wait to go there again!",1
trn_3178,"Came here for some take out today because it's always on the top of my best matches when I do a quick search for a lunchtime place, and of course because of the amazing reviews.   I generally like, but do not love Hawaiian and Korean restaurants I have tried, and after eating my Combo Plate with Brown rice, I can say the same for Island Style.

One thing I must say is that getting take out probably diminishes some of the experience and I can easily see it being bumped up to 4 stars with some boiled peanuts and some extra banchan than what was provided with takeout (kimchi only, which was delicious).   Service was top notch for my takeout.   It was packed inside and I was probably a little early and Russell and.... Gina(?) were extremely friendly and did their best to get me my food quickly.   Russell even generously gave me a bottle of water while I was standing there waiting, which was much, much appreciated after the short walk from my car through the flames of hell that was this afternoon's sunshine to the entrance.   He also asked if I wanted hot sauce and I was provided a small container of Sriracha, which is never a bad thing

Opening my takeout container back at the office, I was impressed at the sheer amount of food.   A healthy portion of BBQ Chicken, Ribs, and Meat Jun awaited me.   I liked all three, but didn't love any single one of them at the same time.  

My overall impression was it was a very satisfying meal, but I think for my next visit I'd like to actually sit and eat, take in some of the boiled peanuts and banchan, and maybe try a dish that doesnt translate well to takeout like the Stone Pot Bibimbap (even though I have no idea what the hell it is)",0

trn_3185,"I was craving for a hotdog and my BF was craving for a shawarma, so we thought we'd try this place out, as it seems to be the perfect choice at the moment due to good reviews, and it's a family run business.

When we came in there were quite a few people ahead of us, and when it was our turn to order, the cashier JUST LEFT THE CASH and started preparing food. So we had to wait for a few minutes before one of their staff saw us and took our orders. They are CLEARLY understaffed.

I got the hotdog for $4 and my BF got a chicken shawarma.

I saw them put the hotdog in the microwave and then later placed on the grill get have ""grill marks"". The chicken shawarma is huge and my BF can't finish it. Can't go wrong with their shawarma, as it's always good quality and you get a very good portion all the time.

Whenever we come here, there is always such a long wait for food to be prepared, and I don't like it that most of the time, there is no one attending the cash. After I ate, I wanted to get another drink and I had to wait a few minutes for someone to notice me waiting at the cashier station, while the other staff just sat down and ate their own lunches, talk to their guests, and make food.

I have always been disappointed at their slow service, and they pay little attention to the cash.

If you want to get quick service, I suggest calling ahead, as you can't just walk in and out from this place, you will be here a while due to slow service. I will come back, but with much lower expectations on service.",-1

trn_3200,"I've been living in the valley for 3 years now and I love everything about this place, except the Chinese food!  I have been nothing but disappointed up to this point.  Everyone claims to have NYC Chinese and none of it is even close.  I just happen to be in chandler and happen to stop by this place.  It was a toss up between the safe bet (the bbq spot next door) and this joint.  After carful thought I decided to give this place a try.  

Everything about the inside reminded me of home but I need to try the food to be sure.  I ordered the basics; shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  To my surprise, the food resembled NYC Chinese food!  The orange chicken looked normal, not like sweet and sour chicken balls.  The sauce had orange peals and red chili peppers.  Could this be?  Is this the real deal? I've learned to inspect and taste the food before I leave.  I'm happy to say that after one small bite I was blown away.  I took one bite and was back in Brooklyn at the So Good Chinese Carry out.  This is hands down the best Chinese food in town, so good that I drive 40 miles to chandler once a week to get a taste of NYC.  

If your from the east coast and love NY style Chinese food, this is the place to get it.  NO WHERE  in the Valley can come close to this place, I want them to open more locations around the valley!",1

Doctor-to-be, (D2B) and Marketing Babe, my 2 best friends and I met up for dinner prior to the Yelp Elite event at Cafe Monroe.  D2B picked the restaurant tonight, and he did me proud!

Earth is located steps away from Rosedale subway station.  The decor is lounge-y chic, and the seating was extremely comfortable.  We got a table right by the window which is always nice.  Earth is a restaurant that runs on the philosophy of ""slow food.""  No it doesn't mean you'll be waiting hours for  your food.  The slow food movement was founded by Carlo Petrini in 1986 to counteract fast food.  The premise is to encourage the cultivation and use of local produce.  Everything on the menu (save for seafood, since we are not near a port of any kind) comes from local producers within a 100-mile radius.  

I sipped on a Lychee Martini while waiting for my fashionably late BFFs to arrive.  The server, Antony (such a sweetheart) did warn me that they can make my favourite martini, but that unfortunately they don't have any lychees for garnish.  I was a  little disappointed, but the martini was so good that it was a moot point.

My BFFs finally arrived and a Cider 'Tini and Sweet Thyme were ordered.  The Sweet Thyme is a drink made from vodka, ice wine, thyme, simple syrup and crystallized thyme.  

The ""bread basket"" that we were brought was quite a surprise as it was a Buttermilk Thyme Biscuit.  It was very flaky on the outside, and dense, and soft on the inside.  Yummy!

Marketing Babe ordered the soup of the day, which was a Cauliflower Soup topped with Chili Oil to start.  It was a perfect companion to the Buttermilk Thyme Biscuit.  

For mains, we ordered the ""Finest Plate"" which today, was a quail served on herb-roasted potatoes and a bed of red peppers, raisins, and pine nuts with scallops.  The quail was perfectly seared with a nice browning of the skin while the meat was extremely tender and moist.  

I ordered the Rabbit Loin, and I am still having dreams about it at work.  It was wrapped in bacon, served atop a bed of soft polenta, with a butternut squash ragu.  It was absolutely and utterly delicious.  The smokey flavour of the bacon was just amazing and no additional salt was needed to season the rabbit as the salts of the bacon served to infuse it with intense flavour.  The polenta was extremely creamy and savoury and sure beats the hell out of a boring mashed potato.

The most disappointing dish of the night was the Veal which consisted of braised cheeks, sweetbreads, and a blue mash.  While it was extremely moist and tender, it lacked in flavour and was very bland.  The same can be said of the mashed potatoes that accompanied it. 

We also got a plate of Yukon Gold Fries for the table.  Their fries are fried in duck fat. Need I say more?  I think not.

Our server Antony was extremely attentive and explained the specials down to the very minute details.  

All in all a great dining experience.  The food is delicious, and prepared in their wood oven and the atmosphere is relaxing.  It is great for a group of friends or for date night.  I will definitely be back!",1
trn_3204,This is our go-to place for special occasions.  The lump crab meat appetizer will melt in your mouth.  Don't go if you are in a hurry.  This is a dining experience.  The staff are engaging and professional.  I have never had anything that I didn't think was outstanding.  If you go on a weekend there will be music in the bar area.  Always top notch.,1
trn_3205,"Pretty good place, but not exceptional either. At least I can report that the service was fine with me, which apparently has not been the case for other reviewers.

They get credit for having literally dozens of options for drinks. That said, I can only review based on the one I had. I was intrigued at seeing a drink with oatmeal in it, especially since I'm a texture guy. The description was poor though, but it was explained that it was essentially a chocolate milkshake with blended oatmeal.

I did end up enjoying the oatmeal aspect of the shake, but I was surprised that it had a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top that wasn't blended it. It was literally half the cup and the ice cream itself was fairly poor quality which really brought it down.

A bit of a mixed experience. I'd would try it again, but I'm not rushing back either.",-1
trn_3206,"We stayed at the Linq hotel and of course this is where it's located at. We love watching Guy on food network and thought how cool he has a restaurant here and we should check it out sometime. There always seem to have a long line and wait so we decided to come back and try again. The second night we were there the wait was about 30-45 minutes. We didn't wait too long and were seated right away. We were sat up against the walls were all 2-seater tables were, squished next to bigger tables that seat 4. We asked if we could sit at the empty table to our left to have more room and was told no that it's for parties of 4. Well right after that they sat a couple like us at that so called table for 4 only. *eye roll* It took our server awhile to show up and when she did she expected us to basically order our drinks, appetizer, food, and probably ask for our bill too all at once. What is the rush? It wasn't even that busy at 9pm Sunday night.

We placed our ordered and it took awhile to come out. We finished our drinks and then our food showed up at the same time our neighboring table did(who were seated way after we did). All they could say was ""sorry it took long"". Okay so trash can nachos seemed cooled, they dumped it out of a bucket. The ribs had about 3 big slabs and definitely shareable. Nachos tasted okay, meat was cooked nicely but it lacked flavor. Ribs were horrible!!!! Overpriced and not good at all. It looked like they just poured bottles of BBQ sauce over it and served to us cold. We mentioned it and again just a ""sorry"". Well we ended dinner quickly and ended up sick and having to go to the bathroom after that experience. We had to find something else to eat later on that night because we were still hungry. It was a waste of time and money. It didn't live up to Guy's standards but then again everyone whose ""out there and known for"" usually has a restaurant and is packed because they're known and not all will be great. Don't bother stopping in.",-1
trn_3207,"If you are craving for a dried up, slightly burnt beef patty then come here! I came here to order take out on sunday 12:45pm, no burgers were coming out their kitchen for the first 20mins.  They need to butcher the cow, grind the meat and cook it? Finally got our order 45mins later, which btw it was the 3rd order (4th burger) coming out from the kitchen! The owner came over to us letting us know our orders are ready with no apologies for the long wait...which btw it turned out it was the take out bags sitting on the counter for the pass 5 mins.  Why didn't they just shout out the order number? When clearly the cashier at the counter was just standing there....ummm...looking pretty?

I order the Firefighter burger...like i mention the patty was overcooked!!! It was served with a crusted THIN slick portobello mushroom stuffed with BARELY any cheese.  For a $13.99+tax burger i had a slightly higher expectation than this! Never coming back!!",-1
trn_3208,"This place is fast and delicious! 

Thank goodness because my grandparents and I just got done with a dreaded 2 hour dr appointment and was starving!

I order the chicken and Waffles and it was delicious! It came with 3 huge pieces of fried chicken with 4 pieces of waffles topped with what looked and tasted like strawberry butter. I should've took a picture but a picture was the last thing on my mind since it looked so yummy and I was starving lol.

My grandparents ordered the fried chicken sandwich and that too was huge and delicious!

If you get to choose your waiter, John was pleasant/funny and very attentive. He told us that our food might take longer than expected.

Highly recommend trying this place!",1
trn_3209,"Definitely worth trying. There is nothing exceptional about this place, but I don't have any cons. 

The prices were what you'd expect for something on the strip. The portion size is worth what you pay, though. 

The atmosphere is typical Las Vegas. A lot of neon lighting and mirrors. Very ""glamorous"" motif as you would expect for Vegas. 

The waitress was very friendly and attentive.

Overall, it was a good experience! I enjoyed my night out!",1
trn_3210,"I had really high expectations for this restaurant. The food was fresh but not wow

We ate:
- complimentary Bruschetta:(4/5) hit the spot, but difficult to eat
- Green salad: (3/5) generic arugula salad
- Pizza with anchovies: (5/5) SO GOOOOODDDDDD and cheesy
- Olive oil pasta: (4/5) fresh and simple
- Sea bass:(3/5) expensive and mediocre

While the decor is homey and very Milan-like,  the experience was not very special or unique.",0
trn_3211,"I chanced upon this ice-cream & sorbet shop when I was doing my maiden round at Jean Talon Market. I could sense that adrenaline rush in me when it comes to candied stuff and asking myself if I should get a scoop at 9am seems unwarranted. 

Desserts in any form always make my day, I am not a real sweet toothed but when u are away from home for an extended period of time and missed some of that comforting food, u just need something to get yourself connected and feel good. And ice cream is the easiest and cheapest means to get me excited and happy and especially when that the ice creams are laced with maple syrup - 2 maple flavored ones are waving at me from afar!

Obviously there wasn't any crowd on a Friday morning when I patronized. I asked for a sample on the 2 maple ice cream and when I couldn't decide which one to get, the lady offer a mix of both even for a petite cup (the mini in the cup range). 

Smooth, creamy and intense, the Caramel & Maple ice cream swept me off my feet. Instantly, I revealed a broad smile! I know this is a notch sweeter than the ones I had at Maple Delights, but the latter don't partner up caramel with maple in their store. This one at Havres-aux-Glaces has a robust burnt sugar taste with a harmonious maple scent, clean and without a trace of off-flavor. Lovely. The she mixed it up with my second choice; Maple and pecans. Equally smooth and creamy, this is less nectarous than the caramel variant but it has a modest pecan bites in them, adding extra depth, quite nutty but Maple Delights is more generous in their walnut helping. 

The service is prompt although the lady at the counter didn't win the ""most friendlier"" badge from me. But the gooey taste in that single scoop makes up for that. I couldn't care much as long as it put a smile on me! $2.35 for a petite cup? Definitely worth any moment!!",1

This is my fourth time here and I never regret it.",1

Yes - you can go anytime during that month!! Much better than those darn birthday clubs that you can only utilize on your actual birth date. The hostess is amazing - she is super friendly and so funny. When we went this past time the service was a little slow - it took a waitress about 7-8 minutes to come take our drink order after we sat down... But other than that it was fantastic. The hostess immediately came over and apologized for the wait so that made up for it. The food is delicious, and in my opinion they have the best sauces out of all the hibachi places I have been to in Northeast Ohio! Love them and would highly recommend them - ask to join the birthday club when you go! :)",1

I have a shrimp allergy and from that point didn't want to eat any of the other dishes we ordered because how the hell do i know if there's shrimp

I do feel that the Growlers are not competitively priced in their retail.  If they were closer to other micro's growler prices I would definitely change my review to 4 stars.

EDIT - Changing my vote to 4 stars because they do have amazing beer and their owner loves to fight for the rights of Ontario beer fans.",1
trn_3219,Very poor experience. Waited an hour for food that never came. They never put in our appetizer. People around us who came in after us got served and left.

I was renting an economy car and there weren't any available, but while he was drawing up my paperwork, an SUV which was ready, had just pulled in. KALEB was nice enough to allow me to rent the SUV at the price of the economy car since there were none other available. 

I got a great deal on the length of my rental!

Needless to say, I left totally satisfied with my transaction with this business.",1

In the past when I heard the word ""documentary"" I used to think...ZZZZZZZZ, ho hum. Not anymore! My favourite from the 2010/2011 season was ""Wasteland"". This is about the largest landfill ever, on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, and the people (wonderful characters all) who eke out a living there. A must see!

trn_3228,"The rooms are nice, but that's the only positive thing I have to say about this hotel.

The front desk agent messed up the room they put us in. We paid for an upgrade on the spot and they didn't give us the upgrade. When we asked them to change our room they took FOREVER to send us a key (they quoted 20 minutes, and it took about 45-50). We had to call three times to ask what was up. Then when we got to our upgrade it still wasn't a view of the strip unless you literally stood next to the window. 

They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING and they don't even have a coffee maker, a bag for laundry, or any of the things that even Motel 6 gives you. There was no price sheet anywhere for the minibar. I might have used some of it had I known the cost.

When we tried to talk to a manager on the phone they didn't let us, so we decided to go down and talk to one ourselves. They compensated us by giving us a free late checkout..that's just insulting. AND the cherry on top was that they ""accidentally"" overcharged us!!! So now I'm in the process of getting $138 refunded to me. Absolutely miserable.",-1
trn_3229,"EDIT:
Paul reached out to, and all issues were addressed !! Thanks, Paul !

This review is for the Henderson location. I could have sworn I submitted a review when it happened, but it somehow disappeared. Weird. Anyways, I heard the Vegas location is much better. /shrug

I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.

The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.

Now somebody rear ended me, and guess what, the insurance company wants to send me there. There's not a snowball's chance in hell I ever have them touch any of my cars again.",1
trn_3230,"This experience was amazing. The food was great, the white sangria is very refreshing and the service was beyond good. Ask for Randy, he will take care of you. He knows the menu very well.  Guacamole was fabulous and I don't even like avocados!!  Kale salad - great!  Cauliflower - great!  Chicken chicharrones - great!  But my favorite was their corn mac and cheese. I can't remember what it's called but it's essentially mac and cheese with corn instead of pasta. So yummy!  I will definitely return to try the octopus and the Meyer lemon chicken.

After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes. The most we actually saw our server was when she hovered over us as we put the tip into the handheld credit card terminal.

trn_3237,"We were recommended this place because of their inside garden and a very nice setting. I can honestly say that the food didn't disappoint, but it wasn't anything to write home about either. Good, Tasty, satisfying - yes. Anything unusual or unique - not so much. Pricewise, they were decent too, so no regrets.

Their most prized perk, however, is the inside garden. When we got there, there was a ton of people in line waiting to get there. They don't take reservations for dinner, so you can't really avoid this, if you want to visit that garden. It looked very nice and intimate with live music (I think they have that few times a week), but it also felt somewhat hot and stuffy there, despite the size and trees in the area. 

We opted out for outside patio facing the busy pedestrian square, and didn't regret it - you can enjoy nice weather while being covered from elements and do a lot of people watching. 

All and all - I would recommend them for good decently priced food in a nice setting and perfect location. However, there are a lot of more interesting and unusual places around.",1

When we sat down at our table it took 10 mins for the waitress to come over for our drink order then another 10 for the girl to come and bring us some chips and salsa.  She brought us a basket of chip crumbs.   Once the waitress came back with our drink order I asked if we could bring us some chips so we could try the salsa.  She brought us more crumbs.  Disappointing!   You need to have chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant!!!  Ok now comes the food, there isn't much to select on the menu so I tried the cheese enchiladas.  You really can't mess that up!   Well they bring me something that looks like a corn tortilla topped with salsa.  It was so gross and the beans on the plate looked like they scraped a baby's diaper!    The only thing I could eat was the rice and that was not cooked all they way!

But then I found a photo on Pinterest of a bride with an incredibly thin black veil in the sheerest, most delicate tulle I've ever seen, and I adored it. I miraculously tracked it down as having been made by Cleo & Clementine, so I reached out to them and asked them about the possibility of making one for me. I actually assumed it would be way more expensive than it was, but the price (~$300 for cathedral length) was within my range. They worked with me via email to create my custom order, and it finally arrived tonight! 

My dress is also being custom made, so I don't have it yet, and therefore don't have any way of knowing how the veil with look paired with my dress. I imagine, though, that it will be perfect.

On the day of my birthday at around 4:20 pm, I called to tell them to tell them that I was about 16 minutes away. BEFORE I can even say why I am calling, I am rudely interrupted by a male voice that states, ""We close in 30 minutes."" I begin to try to talk again & he says ""30 minutes. Closed. Okay?"" AND HANGS UP THE PHONE!!!!!!! The cake was decent & not nearly as pretty as I thought it'd be. They ALSO put my name in quotation marks on my cake as if it was a nickname or something?!?! (Happy Birthday ""MacKenzie"") Helloooo??? MacKenzie is my NAME. Why are their quotation marks around it?",-1
trn_3259,"Let me tell you, I am fond of their calimari!  

If I am absorbing the spiritual energies and might of the slain beast I am devouring, the noble squid is a wise choice indeed.  The lemon wedges on the side were good as I can rest assured that I have eluded scurvy for at least the time being due to their high vitamin C content.  Did someone say cocktail sauce???  Oh hell yeah!!!

My inner animal spirit is primarily Architeuthis dux (giant squid) or, sometimes, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni (colossal squid) but now it might be the particular binomial nomenclature of the Albo's calimari squid.

I like to drink Sprite with it!  =D",1

Our server also suggested the sea bass or the yellowtail tacos, we'll go for those next time. For dessert we had the chocolate banana cake and it did not disappoint. The $14 vodka and soda felt like the disappointment of the evening. Better off to drink tap water!  With tip we were at $100 for 2 people.",1

trn_3263,"LAst January my Daughter got married at the Castle.  When we got there at the specified time for our rehearsal the only person who was there was the owner as there was a bridal show going on in Phoenix that weekend.  The wedding planner who was supposed to be helping us wasn't there and we had to wait almost an hours for the ""Owner"" to get to us...she was showing the venue to prospective clients.   She completely rushed thru the process verbally in approximately ten to fifteen minutes and  there was not a run thru at all.  When I questioned things she rudely informed me that she had ""done this hundreds of times and don't worry!""  The next day when we got there to set up she was, again, giving a tour while leaving us waiting and not knowing what was going on. She didn't know ANYTHING!  She thought the wedding was going to be outdoors when it was planned to be indoors so she had to scrammble to push the tables apart.  The whole affair felt thrown together and she was not helpful at all!  My daughter got a lot of promises with very little delivery.   The guests made the event and the joy of the occasion overshadowed the debacle that was Ashley Manor!  Go somewhere else would be my suggestion...you can get pretty pictures lots of places!",-1

trn_3270,"I've been at this festival for the last 3 hours and honestly I would have left within the first 10 minutes if it weren't for the promise of a live Blues Traveler concert at 4:15 pm.  I really miss my $35.

I'll break this down into 3 categories: beer, burgers, and music.

BEER - someone please tell the people serving the beer how to pour it properly!  Every sample I had was 80% head.  And don't expect anything you haven't seen before.  If you've ever been to Total Wine, you've seen all these beers before.

BURGERS - the one tiny burger I had was delicious (Brazwells!), and I didn't mind the size.  After all...isn't the whole point to sample and rate the different burgers to determine the best burger in Charlotte?  They even gave out chits at the entrance for this specific purpose.  Too bad they sold so many tickets that getting more than 1 burger was nearly impossible.  We waited in line for over 30 minutes for the one burger and waited 45 minutes in line for a second before giving up.  There were probably 75 people still in front of us at that point.  We also talked to several other festival goers with the same experience.  I guess we'll need to grab dinner after this.

MUSIC - Blues Traveler sounds pretty good, so at least that's something.  It's a big improvement from the repetitive noise they had on repeat for the last 45 minutes.  Yes, the band was 45 minutes late.  We almost left from sheer frustration.  There was no excuse about technical difficulties or a band member feeling ill.  Just late, no apologies.

In short, this festival is not worth it unless your favorite hobbies include starving, waiting, and feeling disappointed.  I have no plans to attend next year.",-1
trn_3271,"Ok more like 3.5. I went there because it was No 1 on Yelp , just another American restaurant. Name is misleading - I was expecting more of meat products like the preserved meat etc - something like publican in Chicago. This is not a meat and cheese place but restaurant, writing this to let others know.",1
trn_3272,"Decided to check this place out after reading about it on BlogTO. It's an alright burrito place. Personally I prefer Burrito Boyz for a few reasons. I had the Chicken Mango burrito and my fiance had the Shrimp burrito. I liked the combination of the fresh sweet mango slices with the nicely cooked chicken, fresh cilantro, mushy beans and rice, and the slight kick from the hot sauce. However,  it was poorly wrapped and it could have been pressed a bit longer. By the time I got through a third of the burrito, it got soggy and almost was falling apart. The shrimp burrito was also poorly wrapped. Better pressed however the shrimp was completely unseasoned. Perhaps eating it altogether would be a good combination but I've had much better flavours,  consistency and wrapping at Burrito Boyz and Bar Burrito. 

We also had the fries supreme. Fries cooked fresh and all ingredients (tomatoes, onions) crisp and fresh. Didn't really like the processed cheese on top. Reminded me of a Taco Bell fries supreme.  

An alright burrito place but I won't be making the drive out over other burrito places. Nice customer service and clean looking place.",0
trn_3273,"Good food. Average service. Based on other reviews my expectations were very high.... My wife and I had an 8pm reservation and were seated promptly. We sat for over 5 minutes before anyone offered us a drink, although the busser did come around filling waters. No cocktail list.  I just ordered my usual, a Manhattan. The duck pate was pretty solid, and we had the duck confit and the steak for dinner. Steak was perfect, but I was pretty disappointed in the duck portion size... 1 leg! What was odd was that our server kept trying to push wine on us for dinner. Being a French place, I get it, but when I say no thanks you don't need to ask 3 more times. Let me enjoy my liquor! We don't normally order dessert but it was a special occasion... I had the mousse and she had the parfait. Both were good.  Atmosphere was more ""place to bring my parents"" than ""place to bring my wife."" Overall, the steak and the pate were excellent while the rest was satisfactory. That all adds up to 4 stars!",1

They charged us for 3 dishes, but brought out only 2 bowls after waiting for 15 minutes, completely forgot mine. After another 10-minute wait, my dish eventually came out but it was only 80% cooked, tasted gooey like eating glue sticks. At this time, my husband said his green curry was between raw and medium, like chewing hard plastics in mouth. He took it out to have it re-cooked, they made a new one for him. However, I tried some Mac & Cheese for my daughter, it was ""glue sticks"" as well. She did not want to eat it any more after taking five bites. It took us a long time to get our food, and they all taste like junks, totally wasted our time and money.",-1

Unbelievably inexpensive and pretty tasty! What more could you ask for if you're up playing poker online?! The fish tacos were delicious, ended up getting a combo.

As for the customer service. I will give this place two thumbs up. Our party started out a little rocky due to our room accidently being double booked. However, the general manager, made everything great. I was little disappointed at first but let me just say they made everything right! I didn't have to throw a fit or even ask for much. Once the mistake was realized the team was on it to take care of us.

We will definitely be going back for some awesome jump time.

I don't come that often, and it is a pleasant surprise each time how good the food and desserts are because the exterior is so unassuming. Favorite so far is the Smothered Chicken, the Meatloaf is good too. The brownie desert is a must-have for three reasons: 1) It tastes good, 2) the temperatures are perfect and 3) the presentation is fun. What does that mean ""temperatures""? The brownie is comfortingly warm, the ice cream is ice cold and the raspberry sauce is cool. I've been to other places where the whole dessert is cold, probably because the whole thing is stored in the fridge - which makes the brownie cold, chewy, and sad. No sad food here! Food and dessert at Armadillo Grill and is a happy experience :)",1

trn_3284,"Came here the other day. I would first like to compliment the employee named guierlmo. This is referring to the Asian manager for the evening shift. The employee was great the manager was not. I promptly arrived at the drive through at 11:45 realized I forgot my wallet. Told the employee I had just forgotten it. He said that's fine run home and get it I'll have your food waiting. I said oh wow thank you so much I know you close at 12:00 but I appreciate it he said don't worry it'll be waiting. I come back at 12:08 the employee is at the window very nice young man, excellent customer service must be newer. Tells his boss that I'm here, this is where the problem starts. His boss proceeds to tell me loudly and disrespectfully again and again how the registers are closed out and how he can't allow me to do the transaction. He doesn't even take time to listen to what I have to say, I wasn't arguing with him. After about 3 minutes of him getting louder and louder with me repeating the same thing. Thinking that I am arguing with him, it finally clicks. The entire time I was saying I completely understand, that's not your fault it's my fault I should have had my card with me.. all I ask is that you inform your employees of this.

I was so sick and I ended up staying at SVH for 3 days until I could get transferred to AGH where my doctors are on staff. While I was there, the nurses and doctors were great.

trn_3288,"I came here expecting great, authentic Taiwanese noodles from recommendations from friends and Yelp reviews that raved about this place. Unfortunately, the noodle soups didn't quite live up to my standards. 

Let's start with the good stuff:
- Bubble teas taste great (I had jasmine green milk tea w/grass jelly)
- Jellyfish appetizer was nicely pickled and fresh
- Soup dumplings are pretty tasty too. Good thin dough, good flavor
- Beef in scallion pancake was really savory. Thumbs up
- Noodles itself had a good texture. Doughy, slightly chewy, just the way I like my hand-tossed noodles
- Good, friendly service

Now the part for me that broke the deal was that the actual taste of the noodle dishes was completely bland.

- Ox tail soup - Soup was pretty much tasteless to me...
- Zha Jiang mien - flavor was lacking in the sauce. Tasted to me like they just took a scoop of the Chinese bean sauce and mixed it in. (They did give a good portion of toppings and cucumbers, though)

They also refused to accommodate a take-out order for me where the noodles are packed separately and uncooked. This was 30 minutes before the restaurant closed so the kitchen should still be open ....

For a noodle restaurant, I expected more from the noodle staples. Sorry!

I would come back here for the milk teas and appetizers, though.",0

trn_3292,"I am a regular Hertz customer, so to try another rental car company is a rare occurrence. However, for my most recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ I went with Payless.  Why?  Because Hertz wanted $180 for a 1 day rental and Payless gave me a rate of $29!  Seriously!

My expectations were very low as I've rented from Payless before and wasn't too impressed.  I booked my reservation online via Expedia.  I took the airport shuttle from baggage claim to the car rental center which is a couple of miles away from the airport.

It was easy to find Payless, they're located at the middle-left side of the rental center sharing a space with Fox Rent a Car.  When I arrived, there was 1 person in line at Payless and 20 people in line at Fox....I think the people at Fox were jealous of how quickly we were able to get assistance...ha!

The check-in process was pretty fast, but it was a little frustrating having to give all of my information again....I guess their reservation system is not interfaced with Expedia because they didn't have any of my personal info and had to manually input it.

After a short wait, I was given my contract and told to take the escalator down to the 1st floor where the Payless cars were located.  When I got to the 1st floor I went to the car rental desk which had 5 employees and 1 customer at the counter.  1 employee was helping the customer while the other 4 employees had a conversation that was too important to breakup and come help me.  After a ""are you going to f_cking help me?"" look from me to one of them they broke it up and came over to assist.

They gave me the keys to my car, a Honda Civic, and I went on my way.  The car was really nice and drove well.  It had a lot of power and room despite being a compact car.  Easily the best compact rental car I've driven.

Overall Value - I definitely got my money's worth here.

Will I return?  If they beat Hertz's rates by a wide margin like this trip, yes.....otherwise I'll stick with Hertz and their Gold Club customer service.",0

I agree with other reviewers. It is definitely one of the smallest Starbucks I have seen. The best option is to drive-thru. During mornings and evenings, the line starts forming outside the shop and there is hardly any place to sit inside.

I don't know if all Mcdonald's are like that but the ones own by the owner of the ones in the area are so cheap, when did I have to pay extra just because I wanted 3 packs of ketchup for a meal of 6 bucks? that's why I told all my friends at work and an email to all my coworkers about 200 and they don't go there anymore.",-1

trn_3296,"It was absolutely slammed when I went on a Sunday and we were seated fairly quick.  The decor is something out of Starlight Express with crazy neon across the entire restaurant.  The menu is overwhelming, not because it had too many choices, but because just by the wording on the menu you can tell you are about to be served an IMMENSE amount of food.  I have no doubt that if I had had a heavy night of drinking I would have probably appreciated this place a lot more, even though I found it quite good.  The enormous cup of coffee set in front of my partner was setting the bar for what was to come.  The service was a bit quick and abrupt, my partner actually made a comment about trying to find something a little less filling and I think the waitress said something like, ""Well this is all we got"" or something to that nature, but it was more along the lines of funny than it was rude.  I had the Eggs Benedict and he had the Ham and Eggs, note that every item on the menu comes with at LEAST 3 eggs.  Our food did take quite a while, but as I said, it was Sunday Brunch time and the place was packed with a line out the door.  When our food arrived it was hysterical.  My Benedict was enormous, 3 eggs spread across 2 english muffins, and the rest of my plate was covered in a thick delicious layer of hash browns,  Eggs were fluffy and light.  My partner, wow, if I could paint you a picture of how much food was on his plate...  Ok this slice of grilled ham was so large that the plate was literally layered with food instead of spaced across the plate.  The under layer, hashbrowns, above that a huge slice of ham even with the bone, and then the 3 eggs on top.  It was quite entertaining watching him attempt to eat what he could so he didn't feel like he was wasting food.  I will note that our waitress took a drink off our bill for the wait even though we never said a word and we were quite happy to enjoy each others company, so they are certainly not the kind of place that sees being busy as an excuse for not exceeding customer service.

I go here for my Brazilian, so obviously it has some redeeming qualities because I keep going back.  BUT I've had so many frustrations EVERY SINGLE TIME I go here, I'd be hard pressed to actually recommend it to someone else.

First - I go to Erika and she's great.  Professional, funny, quick.  No pain.  Easy.

The front of house staff is terrible.  They ignore you. They never offer me a drink, I always have to ask, and then it's usually like I'm realllllly bothering them.  They've never been on time for my appointment, so leave cushion room for yourself if you're headed somewhere.  They never apologize for running late or even seem to acknowledge it.  I've arrived early before (my own fault) and it was soooo hot, so I came inside to wait, and they were empty, but they treated me like a total bother for having come early - like, ""Ummm you're early?!""  which I guess is an annoyance, since they were planning on being late anyway....

trn_3314,"The old guy who works graveyard is a super rude prick. Went to make a purchase in the morning before work as I usually do.

trn_3318,We went a couple of weeks ago to have drinks. I really enjoyed it. The bartender Brendan was great he made some awesome specialty drinks and he took care of us even though he was a little busy we did not feel neglected. I would love the experience of staying in one of the rooms. I love the convenience of being able to step out of my car and go right to he lounge area. It was cozy and perfect for a little getaway,1
trn_3319,"Great theater and staff. Fandango wouldnt help me out when I had a blowout and couldn't make my movie on time. Got there to see Star Wars with my son and its 45 minutes into the movie and the employee said don't worry we will get you into the next one which was sweet. Seating is so comfortable that I will not go to another theater with regular seats, the recliners are awesome! No complaints!",1

trn_3321,"The Grape..a friendly, cozy place to bring your friends or a date, if those things still happen anymore. 

The interior ambiance is sleek if you can appreciate abstract and interesting art (which I do), with live bands or a pianist you will enjoy a decent play-list while you wine and dine. 

Food at the Grape is delicious! It's a bit on the pricey side and it sort of has that tapas feel as far as portion sizes go, but definitely worth it if you're looking to treat yourself to something different one evening. 

As far as service goes, the Manager/Hostess is ALWAYS super friendly and to me, that means a LOT. A friendly person to greet you upon entering the restaurant sets the tone for the rest of the evening. 

I'm pretty sure our server that evening was a member of the Jersey Shore cast, but with that aside, and moving past the cheesy banter as he hit on my lady friends, all in all it was a great evening. 

Thanks GRAPE for being friendly, having excellent food, being in a fab location, and making me want to join you again some time! 

(Not 5 stars only due to price)",1
trn_3322,"I was surprised at how slow this place was on a Friday night before a concert. I liked the pierogi, my pulled pork sandwich, and the brownie sundae I shared with Darren, though. The service was good, and the place was clean. I think their fries are frozen, but oh well.",1
trn_3323,"this place is a disaster. sat at the bar a few nights ago and was not impressed. the bartenders are terrible, no personality and down right rude. they even charged me for someone else's drinks then argued with me when i complained about my bill. this place wont last long especially with all the competition in Town Square.",-1

trn_3329,"The BF and I haven't been here in a long while but for some reason I really had a hankering for some BBQ and rice.

 Scratch that- I'm Asian and I want that all the time, but was able to convince the BF. 

The meat was on today. There was sirloin slices that were quite tender. Tongue is always pretty good. I appreciate that they always have the thin sliced radish which I use for wrapping meat and lightens up the taste. 

It's not something I can do often but I enjoy it when I do splurge on a meatfest. 

Just a note, the prices have changed a few weeks after I ate here. Dinner/weekends is now $18.99, not $16.99. Lunch price stayed the same at $12.99",1

trn_3331,Worst cleaning service I've ever experienced. These guys are all hustlers who try and fast talk you into spending a ridiculous amount of money for a standard interior/exterior cleaning. On top of that they said it would take no longer than 40 minutes and I ended up waiting for well over an hour and a half. Do not bring your vehicle to this location for any reason.,-1
trn_3332,"A friend took me here for lunch. It's located on Bell Road, a busy north Phoenix thoroughfare in a car dealer ghetto just off of I-17. I could smell the place before we got into the parking lot.  I knew those would be good. 

I got a chopped brisket sandwich and a cup of potato salad. Friend ordered pulled pork and grilled broccoli which I coveted, even though there was nothing wrong with the obviously homemade potato salad, I'm going for the veggies next time. I had no regrets about the brisket which was smokey and tender. A variety of sauces stood at a continent track which I sampled sparingly to avoid covering the smokey goodness of the brisket. 

We were having family over that evening and had planned for pizza. Making a command decision, I  bought a pound of pork and a half pound of brisket. At home I laid the meat out on a plate to warm in the microwave. The brisket had a nice red smoke ring, with tarty scorched ends. The pork was tender, pleasantly stringy, and succulent, even after being refrigerated and microwaved

Naked Barbecue is one of the best two barbecue jointed I've sampled in Phoenix. Of you're looking for authentic slow-smoked barbecue, I suggest you Go Naked.",1

trn_3334,"We were in search of the famous kouign amman ( pronounced ""queen yah manh "") and hurrah, we found it in this fun neighborhood with too many lovely restaurants to sample on our short trip to Montreal. I've tasted my fair share of these pastries from Bretagne and these are right up there although I've never seen them served in pie-like wedges. No matter- the taste is there. My son got a chocolate tarte and it was so rich he couldn't finish the small portion. The staff are very kind and even let my daughter use their restroom although it was not for customers. And they let us watch as they rolled out the dough and laminated it with butter for their many pastry delicacies- croissants etc. This is a must visit!",1
trn_3335,"When we 1st walked in thru the patio area, we were looking for a host stand. We peeked around the bar, saw a host stand and were seated immediately. This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!

Update! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great. All 5 of us really loved everything. This place is highly recommended.",1

First impressions are everything, including making the phone call for the first appointment. The receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful and I was able to book for the following day. Location is great, it's conveniently placed by the freeway. They have a cat entrance and a dog entrance. Staff upon checking in was friendly, I love seeing consistency within a company. Wait time was brief waiting for the vet. Dr. Scott is AMAZING as well as the vet assistant that was with her! She loves what she does and didn't mind answering all of my questions since this is all new to me. Pricing is reasonable for vaccinations since this is the only service I have gone in for.

The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable. It wasn't over crowded, and just felt like a good place to get a cut. As I finished my haircut the front desk lady was super nice and friendly.

trn_3343,"Candy's Kitchen is a perfect destination for a good, hearty and home-cooked breakfast. Candy and staff welcome you as one of their own and really take pride and enjoyment from having you stop in and in what they are serving you. It was pretty busy this Sunday morning but we quickly found a spot to sit and Candy greeted us right away.  

I had the ""Meaty"" omelette, packed with bacon, sausage and cheese along with a side of home fries and a nicely sized pancake, which I opted for alongside the meal. I don't recall what my breakfast mates had because I was too busy indulging myself in that delicious omelette. And, I forgot to mention, the coffee is just outstanding.  

Candy's Kitchen is simply laid out, nicely decorated in country-ish decor that's not that traditional tacky duck-themed thing.  A good, comfortable spot to spend a morning enjoying some fine breakfast. Not pretentious, just a great family-run spot you can feel right at home in.  It's now part of our regular stops.  Get yourself down to Candy's Kitchen and treat yourself.  You won't be disappointed.",1
trn_3344,"I absolutely love zupas and am a regular here but I have been bothered for the past week with how they treat their trainees. Last week on October 5th, my boyfriend and I came in around 6-7 pm and while we were eating, we saw an Asian woman being trained. There happened to be a bunch of other workers on the floor as well, who seemed to be higher up and were all talking to each other. The woman training was wiping the table next to my boyfriend and I when another woman who was higher up, came up to her and told her she was wiping the tables wrong. She gave her a long lecture about her expectations of how wiping the table should be done because they wanted it to be in a specific way (straight lines, not circles). When the woman was done with her lecture, another man replaced her and began to YELL at the trainee. She already received a lecture about wiping the tables and now she was being given another one right after which was extremely uncalled for? He was saying things along the lines of ""oh is this too hard for you? You really can't do this? It's just wiping a table. If you can't do this and it's too difficult you can leave"". Even if an employee is not meeting an expectation or does something incorrect, it is completely uncalled for to yell at them in the middle of the restaurant with customers surrounding. I understand disciplining your employees and I know it's common for managers and owners to yell occasionally but you really can't take them to the back/office or wait until after store hours at a more appropriate time? This woman was a trainee who was obviously still learning and my boyfriend and I were disgusted to see her being treated with such disrespect in front of all of their customers. It was embarrassing and degrading. Anyone who works in customer service should know not to yell at your employees surrounded by all of your customers and it just made us lose our appetite and want to leave. I debated putting up this review for the fear that it could get this woman in trouble but there is no reason why it should since I have never met or spoken to her. I am only someone who observed this restaurant treating their employees less than they deserve. And for the record, I honestly don't care if my table is wiped with a straight line or circles as long as my table is clean. And sometimes you can't get that nasty grime out with just a straight line across.",-1

trn_3346,"Beau and I did a limo tour our first day in Vegas. It was Friday night and we were sipping on champagne and by 'sipping' i mean we were drinking it straight out of the bottle. Joseph, our driver, took us all over the strip and then down town. We were having such a great time getting to know our surroundings and chatting it up with our driver. He asked us if we wanted to see something really cool. We said ""Yes"". He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices... But like any horror film, against our better judgement, we follow the leader through the back door of the puppymill PEPPERMILL...  we walk in through the back, enter this room filled with fake trees, bright pink couches and pillows and a smoking atmosphere... no, literally... you can smoke in here. There's a beautiful fire pit lounge with blue flames. The waitresses there are dressed in long black gowns and smiling faces. The cocktails are priced well-- the company was established 72 years ago... totally cool feel. It's like you're in an old movie with mobsters relaxing and sipping on gin... except most people are tourists in there. Beau and i didn't order any food, though I've heard it's perfect for late night snacks. Our drinks were great but the atmosphere was awesome. So perfect for the feel of the restaurant. You never would have guessed that the interior would have contrasted to greatly from the exterior. Super cool place. And then we thanked our driver that we got out alive... ;-)",1
trn_3347,"Nandos! A name worth shouting... And Shout I will!

I remember finding this place by coincidence about 3 years ago and after having an amazing lunch I forgot where it was! So, I was getting my car cleaned oat the car wash on Val Vista and Baseline and as I drove around the back I saw the sign... NANDO'S...  and it all came back... I Found IT!!!!

Honestly, I couldn't wait to tell the wife so I picked up the phone and said ""Honey, get in the car and meet me for lunch"" and she did just that.

We split the Fajitas. They are amazing. The meat *chicken and beef) were so tender (I hate tough) and the flavors and freshness of the food filled this ol' mans belly to the brim. I was in fatso heaven!

Heres the bottom line, I have tried numbers items now after my rediscovery and can tell you that the food is great and the portions are gargantuan. If you fill up pretty fast, split a plate. If you eat a big meal, order separately.

The only thing I was not a fan of was the Guacamole and the Chili Relleno. The Guacamole, well... Its the old whipped Guac' recipe But.... it's edible. The Relleno is too full of cheese. Would you like some Chili Relleno with your mound of hot gooey cheese? No Thank You...

Other than those two items, I think you will be really happy with the rest of the menu. Chicken appears to be all white meat too. I'm always a fan of white chicken meat.

Bon' Appetite! Did I just use French in a Mexican restaurant review? Ay Carumba!

We go to this restaurant every week!,1

We were pleasantly surprised to find Loquat fruit near the banana pudding food bar. It is our favorite Asian fruit.  The food was hot.  My guy said the Beef that you carve yourself was good.  I really like the Egg Fu Yung sauce and I put in on the Vegetables and rice.  Unfortunately there were not any Wontons in the soup so I put Pot Stickers in the soup and it was almost the same.

We didn't see the Hostess who dresses strange there and hopefully she doesn't work there anymore.  The Waitstaff doesn't speak much English and hopefully they will hire people who speak some English.",0

Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, as she gives her change. Noticing the line is getting longer you take your time laugh some more. With no one being helped nor being rung up. We are all still standing in line? Then after something is said both of you start to ring up again. With the manager still laughing. So sorry. I have been in retail for a long time totally unacceptable. I left my basket and the 300.00 worth of stuff I was going to buy there. The only good thing is the security officer, she welcomes you as you come in.",-1
trn_3359,"They have staff problems.  I was in there last week and there was a young woman with a polo shirt on that I'm assuming was management of some sort?  Berating employees in front of customers is just not a good thing.  She made me uncomfortable the way she spoke to the kids that were working there.  There was too much drama going on and (i) the customers shouldn't have to listen to that, and (ii) the ""manager"" should be more professional.  No one deserves to be talked to that way and if she doesn't know that, she shouldn't be ""management"".

The food was good, however.  The total experience, not so much.",-1

He went out of his way to explain everything in terms we could understand. We felt he was on our side thru the process. We both are enjoying our new cars.

My trips are fewer now that I live out in East Hell (Queen Creek), but when I lived in Chandler @ Dobson & Warner, I visited much more often. I still love the feel of this place - the dark wood, the high round tables. I feel like I am back in Dublin.

I used to get the bangers & mash every time I visited, but the past few times my most recent time I went with fish & chips - one of my favorites. I didn't see the bangers on the menu this time, so it may have been changed. The full Irish Breakfast is exactly like I had back at the Tyrrellspass Castle Restaurant on my way to Galway, Ireland.

trn_3365,"What a beautiful day spent at this charming zoo! It was our first time there and we loved it :)

It's not big but enough to be entertained for a good hour or so. Our first stop was to see a lion, in the beginning he was lying down lazy and suddenly he got up and that's when the show began, he starting roaring hard and everybody was looking at each other in amaze, excited but kind of scared at the same time.....ummmm ""it's that door really secured""? Jajaja, it was quite an experience let me tell you. Beautiful animals, you really can see they are well taken care of, from exotic multicolor little frogs to big white polar bears. I love the reptile room because it is very educational for children and also for some adults, like me, who have forgotten a few facts about reptiles ;)  they have little boxes showing the brain skeleton of different animals, very nice. There is also an area where people can pet and feed goats, it was so sweet to see how they stood up tall to be fed :) There is plenty of seating throughout the zoo in case you need a break and have an ice cream cone from their restaurant called Glacier. What it really impressed us the most was how close the interaction with the animals is, they are only a few feet away from you, most of them we could see through glass but they are right there watching you very relaxed :) I think this is what makes this zoo unique, the whole family gets a more personal experience with the animals if you can say it like that. We left with a warm feeling and eager to see their future improvements :)",1

Las Vegas Custom cakes is by far the BEST in its class! Their professionalism, Product Quality, artistic Skill, and Customer Service definitely can't be beat! Joe and the rest of their team were Amazing! Some may say custom cakes are pricey and they are but like anything else you get what you pay for! Everyone was in Awe when they seen her cake and said how amazing and delicious it was. BTW it was a two tier Strawberry cake with Strawberry Mousse Filling. In the end all I can say is I was more than satisfied and the cake was definitely worth the price and most of all the look on my friends face was PRICELESS!

The chorizo bowl consisted. of veggies with beef in ketchup, chili oil and cumin. It was sooo salty. Service was terrible. I ordered fish tacos, first entree that I said and the cashier didn't hear it. We waited for it, asked the cashier how long it was going to take and she had an attitude and said we never ordered it. The man that ordered after us chimed in and said he heard us. I asked how long it would take to make fish tacos and she said 15 mins... We left. She had no remorse at all about not getting our order correct. Just move on when you see this place... you're better off going to the food court and getting fast food.",-1
trn_3377,"Great service, they do a good job of explaining things to you and not overselling. I like that they provided me choices and recommendations for parts and services based on my current needs. I will be taking my vehicle back when it's needed.",1
trn_3378,"It's a casual and convenient eat if you're staying at the hotel. We were pretty hungry when we came in. I ordered fish tacos n my hubs got the steak nachos, asked for a side of sliced jalapenos n they brought us fresh ones, not the pickled stuff... it still made the nachos more interesting. Food wasn't spectacular but it's good n filling. Terri was very kind, offered to put our drinks in to-go cups so we could take to the room.

They've a nice bar and plenty of tables. I like the layout n the lighting, very chill.",1
trn_3379,Called in before I headed out to ask when was last call.  First the girl had no idea and asked the other staff and after discussing she said 10:30pm. We made it before 10:30pm after a 30 minute commute and the waitress said the chef had already left. They were not apologetic at all and just said well there's no chef to make the food for you. Was definitely a disappointment since it use to be my late night sushi spot.,-1

I was made fun of for coming here, but I do have to say it was fairly decent for what it is. Back in the States where I live is a huge Arabic population, obvi the food here is fresher and what not but I do have to say Basha wasn't all that bad. I had their falafel which was pretty good, a shawarma, also delish and shared a plate of grape leaves which also were pretty good. Now, I think *my* grape leaves are the best, but these were also pretty good as well. I hate restaurants who take the oil soaked ones and pass them off as food, Basha, does not.",1

The crunchy fish taco had one of the best flour tortillas I've had - very thin and crunchy, not soft and chewy like many flour tortillas (which can be great as well.) The interior was really cute and fun, and the agua frescos wasn't overly sweetened. The music was a bit loud for lunchtime, but at least the song selection was good!",1

We decided to come here mainly because it was close to us and we didn't feel like walking to far.  The menu also seemed promising and it was!  Our server was so nice and even talked to us for a bit about the restaurant. Wish I remembered his name!  From what he said the owner was the guy who owns smash burger so it pretty neat to try the new spin on things since we've had the burgers before.  We went for the 2 fries (regular and sweet potatoes), wings, and potstickers. Everything was pretty good and definitely hit the spot! I'd say sit in the patio the atmosphere is great and you get a nice view of the strip.",1
trn_3389,"I love this place. I have been coming for over a year and had a few trials with techs but I have my main person now...no offense but not telling their name as they are so busy already. 

I also love the new updates to the salon can't wait till side two is done. Lots of chairs, comfortable environment, always accommodating, lots of gel colors. 

I haven't found my pedicure tech yet but I always like Rose.

Pay with cash they charge a .45 cent fee otherwise. 

Always good designs. Very accommodating.

Also get the stamp card, u get 20$ off after 10 visits. They won't tell u about it or remind u to stamp it but still..20$ is 20$.",1

Sadly we couldn't pick and choose our date, so we made it in here on a Tuesday, which isn't the best showcase for this place, I think.  It was pretty empty, and only a pianist was playing, but he did a lot of classical pieces, which I do love as a Symphony subscriber, but not really in the mood for, as we were here to listen to some jazz.  He was actually pretty good.  We would definitely return for a visit on a more popular night.",1

trn_3393,"I love spending the evening here with good friends and good beer. It is lively but laid back and the food is delicious.
Get the Matilda. It's sooo good. The first time I went to Alchemy, I got the salmon and immediately experienced order regret after I tasted the Matilda. The side veggies and salads are always really good as well. The bison burger is similarly on point.
It's a good time, as long as you're willing to get a drink an wait at the bar if its a weekend night.",1

trn_3395,"This place has undergone some changes and it's seriously awesome now. It's got some great beers on tap. There's a menu of standard bar food you can order from - think fried foods and pizza. On this last visit, they were pumping R&B 90s music, which was awesome. They have Big Buck World, darts, and shuffleboard. It's not too dark inside. The decor is themed and fun to look at. It's not empty, but also not crowded, on weeknights. All in all, I am now a total fan. This is the perfect neighborhood bar.",1

trn_3397,"It is very frustrating to get my order in.  I see it get incorrect and try to fix it but the employees do not hear you.  

To make things worse, my order was switched with the lady in front of me. I gave up because I was hungry but let the girls at the register know.

For the record. I ordered a burrito enchilada style with fire Chicken and green sauce. 

What I got was burrito enchilada style with shredded chicken and red sauce. 

I was very disappointed and frustrated. 

Also your assembly line was so chaotic and loud it was hard to get your employees attention. 

The lady making tortillas taking orders did not communicate my party's order correct either. That is where the problem ultimately began. 

I was so excited to have my work friends try Cafe Rio however I am now embarrassed as they all had a bad experience here.",-1

trn_3403,"Rows and rows of games - mostly pinball and a few old cabinet games. Many are their original price of a quarter or two, the modern ones a bit more. My husband and I spent at least three hours here and had more fun (and a better return) on our money than any of the casinos downtown. I highly recommend taking a break from the Strip and coming out to the Hall of Fame to play. Proceeds are even donated to charity so you aren't just lining some fat cat's pockets.",1
trn_3404,"N9NE is the perfect blend of chic modern club setting and backwoods campfire warmth. And by that I mean they have this fun s'mores dessert where they bring out the graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, and fire to your table. Good stuff.

As for the meal, it was a solid filet mignon for an average price. They offered a special filet that had lots of toppings on it that sounded good at the time, but it increased the price substantially so I just forgot about it. The sides we ordered to share were the truffle fries and the lobster mac and cheese. The server told us before that the sides are easily shareable, and that was not a lie. We couldn't finish them. We did find the overall prices to be on the higher end.

Overall, the experience was fun, the servers were attentive (poor guy was on top of my refills because I kept shooting waters the whole meal), and the meal was good-not-great. That being said, it's off the Strip inside the Palms and there are plenty of other places to check out. If it hadn't been for my girlfriend seeking the s'mores dessert, we likely would have just passed over it.

But the thing that won my heart..... Java city coffee.  Oh how I miss thee from my days in Sacramento.  It's like this place blended the favorite places from my past. NYC and SMF.

And yes it's busy on weekends because it the only thing to do in San Tan Valley, Queen Creek and Gilbert, other than going to the mall so don't be to impatient because it's worth it! Go before 5 on a week day if you want to just try it out without paying the most per hour.

trn_3410,"""You ready B?"" - I turn my head and expect to see Jay-Z break into a rap song but instead it's Jerry Jesin shooting the shit with St. Andrew Poultry's chef, Bernadette Calpito who trained under the likes of Massimo Capra and Roger Mooking. She might just be my newest chef crush as she's just a ball of energy and has some serious swagger.

The rebranded butcher shop re-opened last month and is a family business that Jessin took over from his aging parents who ran the joint for some 60+ years.  He's expanded the offerings to include frozen prepared foods and a hot food counter that opens daily at noon.  There is also a small but growing selection of in-house baked goods which consist of scones, banana bread and cookies.

Jesin, is a dentist by trade but had always grown up raising chickens with his parents.  Being the second youngest in a family of six, he tells me that it was always a fight to the finish line at the dinner table lest you want to end up eating the leftover spoils but as a grown-up he's quite the food lover and apparently has very picky taste buds.

The team spent three months in a ""test kitchen"" coming up with the current menu offerings at St. Andrew Poultry which include recipes inspired by Calpito's grandma and mom (the pineapple cabbage ""slaw"" on her wonton beef cheek tacos and fried chicken respectively).

""You'd never expect a filipino to make good shwarma, right?"" quips chef B, but the lamb version here is filled to the brim with a medley of eggplant, onions, and tomatoes topped with French fries, which are bathed in vanilla and bourbon up in this joint.  Calpito tried a variety of different shwarmas from Israeli to Lebanese and the finished product is sort of a ""greatest hits"" compilation, drawing on components from each of the iterations she taste-tested.  For $25 you can also buy a DIY-shwarma, mounted on a spit that you just throw upright into the oven.

Perhaps the biggest draw here is the Supper Club, wherein $20 will get you a lifetime membership and 20% off between the hours of 5-6:30PM on stickered items.  Jesin wanted people to be able to eat during regular dinner hours without having to wait for end-of-the-day markdowns.

Familiar brands such as Neal Brothers and Raincoat Crisps can also be found around the store and you can even grab something for the dog... they have a small section of pet food which was Calpito's idea, being a dog owner herself.  While the meat counter is mostly chicken-heavy, the team expects to roll out a more complete roster of other proteins in the months to come.  Catering is also available and it's not just limited to the items that are on the existing menu.  If there's something you want, chef B will happily deliver.

We're surprised purchases don't come with a pack of dental floss, after all, we all gotta look presentable back at the office ;)

St. Andrew Poultry is open daily from 10am - 7pm.

Pro tip - They have their own parking, though it is soon to turn into a paid parking lot.  Jesin tells me customers get 30 minutes free.  Definitely a plus for convenience.",0
trn_3411,"Okay. Wait for a Saturday night wasn't terrible: 30 mins. Beer is great, and tons of options. My favorite thing we ordered was the Pierogi flat bread, so good. We got the corn dogs and the pretzel as well, which were good just..not as tasty as the flat bread. My friends got the sausage flat bread and loved it and also really enjoyed their tacos and calamari. I think my least favorite thing about the place is how small the portions were for the prices. Everything is supposed to be shareable which...I don't like to share so... haha.",0
trn_3412,"As part of our trip to Vegas we always want to try some of the celebrity Chef restaurants. We heard great things about Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and bar so we gave it try. 
The place was packed and we had about 20 minute wait. We were able to walk around the shops at the Linq promenade to burn some time. When we returned there was a table ready for us. The server greeted us and offered to bring ice water right away. He recommended the bacon Mac n cheese burger as it was the best selling entree. My wife ordered the burger and I got the Motley-Que pulled pork sandwich. The food came out pretty quickly and we were in shock at how big the portions were (see pics). The burger was juicy and Mac n cheese was just right. The Motley-Que was an impressive sandwich  and you will definitely get your hands messy with this beast of a sandwich. The pull pork was tender and I liked the fact they gave me some of the bark of the pork which is the most flavorful part. We were only able to eat about half the burger and sandwich and got it to go. 
Price wise it's not the cheapest bar food but the large portions justified the $21.50 price point per order. The server and bussers were excellent and refilled our waters periodically. 
Overall great experience and nice atmosphere here. The employees were all dressed in cowboy and cowgirl outfits. Will definitely come back to try something else in the menu.",1
trn_3413,"The decor is more of a fast casual however food was surprisingly good. I had the Huevos and Chorizo and it was very tasty. I tried my friends red velvet waffles was also especially good. Yummy! You order in the front and they take the food to the table.

I went in with a book and laptop in the afternoon and ended up staying for 3 hours...yeah im a nerd. Their espressois amazing, nice and strong with a dark roast, i am guessing italian or even darker. They are working on training all of their workers on doing the cool designs on the lattes, but i could care less about that and more about quality. They are the only AZ bar to serve nutella mochas...omg amazing! Why hasn't anyone else thought of this?

This is a very small location, in an odd part of town. I am sure their lease is dirt cheap, but that allows them to provide amazing quality dishes at a good price! They have free wifi set up, so come in the morning or afternoons and hang out!

I tweeted asking my friends if they wanted to go, and 32shea responded, 'come try us out, we have good drinks, great food and our staff is really cute!"" AND the staff is CUTE!

I plan on testing our thier dinner and night life laterz!",1
trn_3419,"I was excited to see that a new ramen place had open so close to where i lived. At the same time, I wasn't expecting much from the little ramen joint that were run by non-Japanese owners. I was quite skeptical but I decided to give it a try given the good reviews.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their ramen. My boyfriend and I order the spicy ramen level 2 and the curry katsu (fried pork cutlet) ramen. The ramen was thick and al dente and the bone broth was very flavourful. Their soft-boiled egg was perfect, it was well marinaded and the yolk was orange and gooey. The spicy ramen at level 2 had a good kick without overpowering everything. (However, i can take quite a bit of heat). What I loved about it, were the little dried shrimps that gave it another dimension of texture and flavour. The curry ramen came with a sizeable portion of pork cutlet, which was accompanied by its own katsu sauce. However, the curry broth was rich enough to accompany the pork as it is. 

I am very satisfied with Koi Sakana and definitely will be coming back to try the other dishes. Definitely excited that I don't have to travel all the way to downtown for a good bowl of ramen :)",1

trn_3425,"So I feel that it's safe to say I give up on Rosatis pizza at Dobson & the 202( Riverview). On two different occasions I've called & we've waited up to 2 hours for our pizza. Another time, the food came cold. For that, I received a $25.00 credit ( which I actually forgot that we had). I decided to give it another shot(after several months) & that pizza, surprisingly, was delivered ok. However, this time, after 45 minutes, this is what was delivered to our door! What the hell is this?! Either they don't know how to place the pizza in a box properly or Mario Andretti was the delivery driver! I called, understandably upset, & was assured by the Manager, Chris, that I would get a new complete order within 30 minutes or less. An hour later, the pizza finally arrives( only the pizza, not the complete order)greasy & the cheese looks like it was placed on the crust. I called the manager again only to be held on hold for 10 minutes to which I was told it was very busy & to call back in an hour or two. I have officially given up on this place! It's shit & the pizza has become shit!

What's even funnier, I was told by the delivery driver who delivered the redo pizza that ""this has NEVER happened before"", meanwhile a post from 22 days ago shows a pizza that showed up in worst condition that ours did! This place is a joke!",-1

In all there was nothing bad about it, just felt a bit ambivalent about the space and experience.  I did like the chaser shot of pickle juice.",0

trn_3434,"Sadly I will never come here again. The food is just as great but the service has become unbearable. If you've read my last review, you'll see that I mentioned the lady who serves and how she lacks  in the good sense department and customer service. I chalk this up to culture differences. So I usually just laugh it off in my head.

Today I brought my mom and sister here and the lady throws our straws. When she gathered our dirty plates she slammed them atop one another. I found it useless to tell her thank you as she continually scowls and can never bring herself to say ""you're welcome"" I hate to bring up the fact that she was very welcoming to the Caucasian patrons. Hell she's even nice to my boyfriend, apparently he has the right shade of brown. Lol I can imagine if she knew he was Latin. No more extra Naam babe, you've been outed. 

So it is what it looks like. I'm nice and respectful so I have no choice but to go to the obvious. She's another foreigner that has these twisted preconceived  notions in regards to minority's. Yeah, you may think I'm nuttier than squirrel sh^t but I'm not someone who thinks every inconvenience has anything to do with color. This lady though is mad! So while the food is good, I will not spend my time or money eating at my second favorite Indian restaurant. In the wise words of my sister, it should be mandatory for citizens and foreigners to take some type of cultural sensitivity training before opening any business. I did think of a joke though, she must be the bizarre in New India Bazaar. Hey I didn't say my joke would be funny.",-1

trn_3437,"We ate our last meal in Charlotte for our Christmas vacation here.  The place was decorated really festively for the holidays.  The ambiance was warm, welcoming, and vibrant.  It was really busy during lunch time, and the tables were turning over rapidly.  Despite crowd, we were greeted immediately after walking through the door and seated pretty quickly.

Hubby and brother split the spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were nice enough to cut the 2 rolls into 4 pieces for the table, but my mom and I decided to wait for our dishes.  Our server didn't even need to write down our orders.  Hubby and I started with the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.  The ratio of milk to coffee was a little too much.  I guess I could have not mixed the entire thing together.

I had the vermicelli noodles with the shrimp on sugar cane and imperial rolls (fried pork rolls) which was delicious.  The portion was just right and I devoured the entire thing.  Mom had a different noodle dish which had all the sauce already mixed, which was a little surprising.  It was almost more an Americanized version of beef and broccoli.  Looking around, it was definitely a place that catered to non-Asian customers..it had to be being in the heart of Charlotte!  Both Hubby and brother had different versions of the beef pho.  The broth was flavorful.  The meal was a nice, healthier way to end our week long holiday vacation.",0

trn_3444,"We stopped in to have a drink on their patio overlooking DTS fountain area. It's a nice place to have a drink and enjoy the nice weather. The margaritas were $11.75 each. They were served in a small rocks glass. They were good though. I could tell they were made with fresh lime juice and not sour mix.

We were there during happy hour, so we ordered some apps from the happy hour menu.

$7 Ahi Poke - served with tortilla chips and covered in a sweet sauce. It was very good.

$5 Buffalo Cauliflower - this was excellent. Surprisingly very good. They fry cauliflower like chicken wings and serve it with hot sauce and ranch.

$4 White Bean Hummus - they serve it with grilled pita. I have had better hummus, but it was good. I really enjoyed the grilled pita.

$4 Quinoa Salad - it was very good. It reminded me of quinoa tabouli without the parsley.

The service was great and I really like how the dining area is set up with the patio and the bars. I will definitely be back for dinner. Their menu looks like a winner to me. If the apps are a preview of what lies ahead, then I think I will enjoy it.

I'll be back!",1

Seth gives me the motivation and encouragement I need to stay focused on the plan he created for me. I've been coming for over two years now to maintain and I still love it!

Nothing feels better than other people noticing the results you put in at the gym - and as a 165 pound man it didn't take long for the compliments to start flowing (and disappear as soon as I moved to Kansas City and stopped working out consistently). 

Qualities I want in a trainer - Easy going, tracks progress, and always motivates you to try/do more. Ty checks them all off, and is an all around cool guy to know (plus doesn't have a barbed wire tattoo or act like most of the meat heads you see in and around 'the dale').

The pricing was comparable to other estimates received but we chose Dukes because everything they said they would do, was in writing, while other companies estimates were vague and left me with a lot of questions!

trn_3451,"I asked around for recommendations for someone to do my hair for my wedding, and someone recommended Jillian at Salon Bohemia to me.  Out of all the stylists and hair dresses I consulted with, Jillian was the only one who wanted to get on the phone with me and talk to me about the details. Not only did she ask the basic questions like date, times, and number of bridesmaids - but she also asked about hair types and lengths. She was so organized!  I knew right away that she would be the one I wanted to trust on my big day. 

Out of all the decisions I made as a bride, Jillian and Alexis at Salon Bohemia were the best. 

Between the trial and the wedding we had multiple appointments to get my hair where we needed it to be for the big day and to get clip in extensions. During these multiple appointments, I got lost, I was late, I had to reschedule - I was a mess - and I got nothing but positivity, love and support! Jillian was a true friend to me, and the day of the wedding proved it to me!

Jillian and Alexis arrived exactly on time, and they finished early. Everyone's hair was perfect. And Jillian went way above and beyond for me. I bought lip liner and lipstick for the day of, and it wasn't a good combination. I kid you not, Jillian whipped out the perfect lip liner and let me borrow it for the day.

My mom showed up with her hair still in pins from her own hair dresser, and Jillian took them out and worked her magic for free.

One of my bridesmaids didn't show up until 1:30 - when I was supposed to be taking first glance photos with my future husband - and I kid you not Jillian did the PERFECT up-do in 10 minutes to make up for lost time (obviously no fault of her own)

With a late bridesmaid, late parents, some miscommunications right before we left for the wedding and photos - it was a MESS, and I was panicked. Jillian calmed me down completely and got me back to a good space. 

As a side note - it's been over two weeks since Jillian did my nails and they are still perfect! I usually am in a lot of pain when I get fake nails and I had none!!! 

If you chose Salon Bohemia - for your wedding day, or day-to-day look, you won't for one moment regret it!",1

trn_3454,"My overall favorite bar in Madison.  If anyone lives in Madison they know that downtown is a majority of college aged kids and the west side is where the 25-35 range are.  The problem with the west side is that it is very hit or miss as far as crowd.  The nice part of the Blue Velvet is that it does attract college aged kids, but also has a good mix of a bit older and makes for a very enjoyable atmosphere.  The bartenders and staff are all very pleasant and the drinks are all strong.  Never had an issue as far as service goes.  They have a lot of drinks exclusive to their venue as well.  You can get a vodka/soda anywhere, but they take the time to figure out new custom drinks that are always fun to try.  I would definitely recommend this place highly.",1

trn_3468,"3.5 stars.  Each day this truck serves up three or four savoury Nawlins inspired dishes, such as beans and rice, and po'boys. I had the blackened catfish po'boy, and must say off the bat that the service was very fast. The seasoning was good, and the fish moist, but equally notable was the excellent bun, which was if you imagine it a cross between a scone and French bread, dusted with flour. The sandwich also had coleslaw, but no pickles or tomatoes as one might expect on a po'boy. A few chips on the side would have been a nice touch.

The bread density and sizeable fish portion made this a very filling lunch for $11, but I persevered and had the voodoo cookie too: oatmeal, choc chips and nuts drizzled with a balsamic reduction. Pretty tasty and inventive, but probably not something I'll go search out again. Overall, this is solid food, and a few condiment/accompaniment adjustments as mentioned above would make it a solid four star truck.",0
trn_3469,"After all the positive reviews on the burgers here, I decided to give this place one more try.  I am still not warming up to it - although the nite we were there they were experiencing HVAC problems so I was warm for a while - sat us next to window that generated even more heat.  Don't know how they are going to sit patrons next to those windows where summer comes.  The entire floor plan is just weird. 

Now for the food - ordered burgers but not without drama - waiter had his little portable order taker which took him twice as long as the conventional way of just writing it down.  Even took all of the condiments we wanted for burgers and patiently put them in.  The wait seemed long for the amount of people in the restaurant at the time but we passed the time by drinking wine - mind you room temperature red wine which was now the actual room temperature of 75 degrees - the wine is stored in the back of the restaurant but from where we sat, the wine was exposed to sunlight at least in the mid-afternoon which raises the temp - again just annoying little things all nite.  Burgers came and waiter plopped down one plate of ""condiments"" for burgers and said the chef said that was enough for 3 people - say what?  Why did you ask and take down our specific requests for the condiments if you were just going to bring a generic plate to the table.  Onions and tomatoes cut so thin you could not even taste them on burger.  Between the three of us we ordered, medium rare, medium and medium well burgers and two of us opted for summer salads rather than fries.  All three plates were dropped at table all with fries.  So after getting waiter's attention we got our salads.  We assumed that the burgers were placed before based on our cooking preference but after placing individual condiments on the burgers and taking the first bite, we realized none of us received what we ordered.  So, maybe it is just me but this place does not live up to a $11 burger, not does it deliver in the service dept. either.",0

trn_3475,"My goodness. This was by far the best BBQ I've eaten a) at an airport and b) in quite some time (Denver, take note). My husband ordered a plate as I cruised the other restaurant choices but after seeing his brisket, I was sold.

I opted for the 1/2lb meat plate. Started with the cheesy potatoes, which are a bowl of deliciousness. Definitely a little on the spicy side but perfectly cooked potatoes and the sauce is amazing. Meat wise, I went for the chicken (as they were out of turkey) and the brisket. Now I'm not a fatty brisket fan and after seeing my husband's pieces, asked the 'chef' to make mine lean. In my mind this was easily done by removing the fat cap, but the 'chef' carving didn't think so. Consequently about a third of the weight of my 'meat' was left to the side of my plate. But, it was perfectly smoked with a thick red ring around the meat, and beyond tender. The chicken was also the best I've had. Super juicy and I would happily order a full plate of that in the future. My husband also had the hot links and was thoroughly impressed.

I would definitely recommend stopping here for a meal as it's delicious and decently 'airport' priced ($10 for what I got). Lo-Lo's next door sells Kool-Aid and so you're set!!",1

trn_3482,"Was here this morning and needed a new part for the toilet. I believe it's called a flush valve. I took the one off my toilet to match up with a new one at the store. 

I got to this location, and looked for a sign that said plumbing. I didn't see one, so I asked an associate. He directed me to the opposite corner to which we were standing. 

I got down the plumbing aisle and couldn't see the part I required. The original part that I had was 11 years old. I guess they've made improvements to it since. 

I pushed the help button, and an announcement was made over their P.A. system. I waited for about 5 min. someone finally showed up. The employee working just came and shut off the call button and started to walk away.
I said to him I need, he didn't let me finish my sentence and he rudely walked away saying he'd be back.

I waited another good 10 minutes or so and decided I was going to go to Home Depot instead. 
On my way out the door I ran into the employee that originally shut off the call button. I asked him if he could help me now.

He said yes, and that he was helping another customer at the time. 
We walked back to the plumbing aisle, with yet another customer that had stopped him on the way back from the front. 
We got to the plumbing aisle and the other customer was helped with their inquiry first.

I was then finally helped with the part I needed for my toilet.

I wouldn't say the customer service I received today was very good.
No apologies were offered. It was like the employee was bitter because he was the only person in plumbing.

I would have handled it differently forsure.",-1
trn_3483,"I've been going to the No. 1 Boba Tea in the Chinatown mall for years because my mom prefers fresh avocado over powder like most of the other boba places in town. Glad they opened one up closer to my home. 

This isn't my favorite place for boba, but I come here often because my mom always wants to go to this location. They use fresh fruits, so some of their drinks aren't readily available if the fruit they have on hand isn't ripe. Unfortunate, but a better choice in order for them to serve their best. 

Their Thai tea is pretty sweet here. The one I order the most here is the matcha milk tea with lychee jelly. Their boba's made pretty well, slightly sweet and quite squishy. Nothing too special about this place, pretty average. Every time I've been here, there are samples on the left side by the register.

One time, their register was down and was cash only for awhile. I wasn't able to get my stars towards the 3 drinks I ordered because of this. I asked if they were able to add it afterwards, to which they said yes. But I came back and saw that it wasn't added at all. 

The staff here is pretty nice (depending on who is at the register). It's a 50/50 chance every time I walk in. 

Overall, I only go here when my mom makes me. Not a place I gravitate towards to when I want boba.",1

trn_3488,"This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the US. I really wasn't expecting the opulence of the interior, so my senses were a little overwhelmed. I got there about 10 minutes before they opened, so as I sat in the car waiting I got to watch the throng of staff as they filtered in. I've never seen that large a number of staff at a restaurant in my entire life. 

As many have said, the menu is way too extensive and the pages of advertising are off-putting. I was greeted almost immediately by a lead waiter and a young man that he was training. Both were very attentive. They both did something I personally find a little annoying, which was to say something like ""excellent choice"" upon my selection of items. My self-esteem is fine, I really don't need my ego massaged. 

I ordered the lunch pepperoni pizza with side salad, and both were good. I followed that with the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, and it would be worth the 52-mile round trip just to have that again. 

The cost for the lunch, including a 20% tip, was $27. As a retired teacher, I find that very pricey, but it was still a good experience. I'd definitely reserve this for only special occasions due to the price.",1

trn_3492,"I got a Livingsocial voucher for the spa at Copperwynd that included a massage and facial, plus use of the facility for the day. I highly recommend it! I arrived early to use the gym, showered and relaxed before my treatments, then had lunch and lounged by the pool for a couple hours. Great experience overall: staff was very friendly and accommodating, the entire resort was spotless, and the food was great! Not to mention the views, breathtaking.",1
trn_3493,"Friends and I were looking for a quick bite before walking around the strip so we stopped into Chicken Latino. We entered thinking it was more of an order at the counter and go situation rather than a seated service, but that ended up not being an issue as the service was fast, friendly, and efficient. 

A friend and I had the Peruvian Chicken, while other had the quesadilla's. Our food was good, but nothing mind blowing. The chicken was flavorful and tender, and the sides were fine. I tried mine with a little bit of their green salsa, which was good, but way hotter than I was ready for. 

Overall I liked Chicken Latino, I just don't know that I would make a trip out of my way for it.",0
trn_3494,"During the tail-end of our trip to AZ this past weekend, my vegetarian husband and I found Green and loved it so much we ate there 3 times in 2 days. It would have been 4 had it not been closed one morning. 

As a meat-eater with a soy allergy, there are many reasons not to eat here, but I gave all of that up to enjoy as many entrees as possible. 

Where do I begin...we tried the buffalo wings which had the right taste and texture as meat ones, and the ranch dressing was perfect, the CRAB PUFFS which were mind-blowing, the bbq sandwich, the curry pasta, the argentine sandwich (delicious bread and chimichurri sauce), the fish tacos (which were good but not nearly as amazing as the other entrees), and the kung pao chicken. And oh yes, two cupcakes and the betterfinger soy ice cream. 

I am so depressed there isn't one in Austin, but I would say Green is reason enough to go back to AZ.",1
trn_3495,Best Blimpie in the country all thanks to Kal!!! Haven't been here in over 5 years and he still remembers me!,1
trn_3496,Only giving it 3 stars because for one their prices are a little more expensive then most . The toppings are minimal and the flavor for the PB is beyond over powering . The peanut butter is all you can taste the acai is non existent. I think so far fruits and roots is the best place in Vegas I've tried this far .,0
trn_3497,"Awesome, good food here. Don't say this often about Applebee's. Had the bourbon chicken and shrimp and it was to die for. Just delicious. Our waiter Shanel was excellent. She took very good care of me and I couldn't complain at all. 

I will definitely come back here again.....

A++ in my book",1

trn_3499,"Our A/C system was about 17 years old, noisy and didn't cool like it should so we decided to have it replaced before the summer heat! We received a few estimates and Robert's estimate was the most thorough, complete with pictures of ducting, etc... up in our attic. The pricing was comparable to other estimates received but we chose Dukes because everything they said they would do, was in writing, while other companies estimates were vague and left me with a lot of questions! The installation crew were great! Freddie, Manny, Luis and Danny were polite, thorough and quiet as I worked from home the day of installation. It's been two months since the install, the temps are heating up outside but our home is nice and cool on the inside. Highly recommend!",1
trn_3500,"The hot dog was delicious, I had 22 toppings.  The service was terrible, my wife's hotdog came missing a couple of ingredients.  The order was remade incorrectly - we all finished before they said she needed to reorder. She will finish at least 30 minutes after the rest of us- boo!

Update - they comped the meal to make up for the poor experience, glad they took positive action to address this - thanks!",1
trn_3501,"This is a decent buffet. About $25 for weekday lunch and it includes house wine and beer.  There was s shrimp and ceviche and guacamole and prime rib and sushi.

The food is ok, service was fine, and the restaurant is clean. The meat was overcooked and the selection is limited.  Compared to the Paris' buffet, same price not Inc beer/wine, this pales in comparison.  

But I was able to have a low carb meal there: shrimp, chicken, turkey, smoked salmon, steamed veggies, and salad.  A bit more than I would pay - I wish they would offer a no booze choice as I hate beer and don't drink cheap wine.",0
trn_3502,"I have been a Barro's consumer since 1990 in high school and have visited and become loyal to many locations throughout the valley since then.  I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this location, its management and staff.  I have ordered from here 4-5 times since they have opened.  Every time I request verbally over the phone for parmesan cheese and red peppers and guess what never arrives or I have to ask for again at in store pickup, yep cheese and peppers.  I understand that this is a small complaint as the food is always good but it is the small stuff that even when confronted to a manager they shrug off and say we will add to your account and blame the staff, this is not acceptable.  Again I can raddle off about 7 locations off the top of my head I eat or have eaten at for years and this is the only location that I can guarantee 100% before we order and request verbally we will never receive. There comes a point that where I either go back to make sure I go to a location I can get on the way home or drive back to or cut my ties in general.  I prefer none of the above and hope this location reads this, learns from it, and moves forward to make sure this does not continue to happen.",-1

trn_3508,"I love dim sum, Chinese food and pretty much all Asian food. 

In the heart of Scarborough you'll find this restaurant in a plaza. From 9am - 3/4pm majority of the dishes are $2.30-$2.50 and anytime after that it's $2.75 if I remember correctly. 

Not only that... it's open 24/7!!! Crazy, I know. Late night cravings for Dim Sum can now be answered. 

However, not many of the waiters or waitress' speak much English so if you have a friend who can speak Chinese or can get by with minimal Cantonese or Mandarin, you're set! 

How the service works:
- People come around in carts to each table with different dishes. Although, sometimes they don't come directly to you, so you will either have to call them over or get up and check their carts yourself. 

Other than that you get your dosage of Chinese food at a responsible price!",0

Good thing it came with mushy French fries to give my over worked jaw a rest.  Why 2 stars?  First, hop drop and roll on draft!  Very good.  Secondly, good music.

trn_3512,"I purchased a used safe on Craigslist.  Not just any safe mind you.  Oh no, I HAD to have the super high security 4000 lb bank safe ... especially at the dirt cheap price it was listed.

Let me say that again - FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.  Two tons.  About the same as a Toyota Highlander.  5 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and about 35 inches deep.

I spent several days calling around to places to get it moved.  No one wanted to touch this thing.  Then I called The Safe Keeper.

Don (the owner) agreed to do it for $800.  More than I wanted to spend, because I'm a cheapskate.  I finally agreed since no one else would take the job.

I'M GLAD I DID!!

Don and 3 of his guys picked it up from a warehouse near the strip, moved it to my home in Centennial.  They used two pallet jacks, an assortment of wood blocks and chocks, and floor coverings.  Four turns and one 36 inch wide doorway later, they had it placed EXACTLY where I wanted it.  No scuffed walls.  No indentations in the linoleum.  No damage to persons or property whatsoever.  

Not a lot impresses me.  (See my other reviews.)  But these guys did.  Folks, the whole crew were professional safe movers who worked seamlessly together.

FIVE STARS.  ALL THE WAY.  CALL THEM WHEN YOU NEED A SAFE MOVED.",1
trn_3513,"Prices, food, staff all deserve 5 stars. Group dinner for 18 all were happy with their meal.",1
trn_3514,"Part One - Like other posters here, I had two contracts with Consignments on Center for which I had not been paid.  So a few months ago I went to the store to ask the wife/owner for an update.  I wasn't upset, I was just curious as to what was going on.  She said she had recently gotten back to work after not having been there for 1 1/2 to 2 months (I can't remember the exact time frame) because of medical problems. She described the medical problems in detail and I'm embarrassed to say that I remember almost none of the specifics of her description. (This isn't like me not to remember.)  I do recall that her medical condition involved something that caused one side or most of one side of her body to be paralyzed and that she was in the hospital for part of the time. (I see that another Yelp poster has also mentioned these same medical problems.)  I had no reason to doubt her, felt terrible for her, expressed my sympathies that this had happened, wished her luck in catching up with all of her paperwork, then looked around the store and bought a pair of shoes (!)

Part Two - Two weeks ago I got a voice message on my home phone from the husband/owner, saying they had been forced out of their lease back on June 27th with only three days notice and that the existing restaurant next door was expanding into their space.  He said the restaurant owner would not allow them to post any forwarding information or a contact phone number on the door.    He said they have my merchandise that I currently had there for consignment.  The husband said they could continue holding it for me (as they were looking for a new retail location) or I could come and pick it up (although he didn't say from where.)  He said he would call me again.  My last name ends with ""B"" so if he was going through their metal box of index cards and calling customers in alphabetical order, perhaps that's why I got this phone call.

These are daunting circumstances for the owners to overcome.  I wish them all the best in getting their business up and running. I will check back to Yelp every once in a while to see if anyone is able to share new facts/updates about what is happening.",1
trn_3515,"I checked it out during the soft launch. The atmosphere is beautiful. The service was great. There were a few minor mistakes due to it being so new (one friend got the wrong burger and another ordered a beer from the menu which was apparently not in stock), but the servers handled it great. The food was very meh and over-priced. I had a quinoa skillet which was served with tomato sauce so overpowering you couldn't taste anything else. The beer menu was huge and wonderful but very hard to read. The beers were also a bit expensive. I kind of understand the markup due to them being imported and more specialized, but I feel Brasserie V has a similarly cool beer menu for a better price and much better and reasonably priced food. Not sure I'll be back.",0
trn_3516,"I'm always one to give a place the benefit of the doubt, so after one horrible visit to Pickle Bills, I reluctantly agreed to go back when a friend decided to have a birthday dinner there. Never again. The food is awful.The drinks are awful. The service is awful. Oh and did I mention the food is awful? I don't get how anyone could want to come here. Sure, the atmosphere is kinda funky (and kinda dirty), and i'ts great being on the lake, but c'mon-nothing tasted fresh, from the seafood to the sides. I had a taste of pretty much everything our party ordered and this was true of everything. Soggy salads, watery, tasteless chowder, old tasting seafood. I am a huge seafood lover and there is no reason to sell frozen products in a restaurant that is supposed to be known for their seafood. 
For the life of me, I just don't get it.",-1
trn_3517,"**update I'll say I've noticed some great improvements at this stand! Thank you! Lol**


I was pretty excited this stand opened up in my neighborhood. I'm a regular at the Scottsdale McDowell location but this one is on the way to most of my adventures. But today we broke up. It's been open almost a year and I figured the kinks would be worked out but no. Every single time, every drink is always wrong. I've tried all my favorites and I've traded them in for something else or had them ""fix"" it. I started drinking DB 4 years ago because of the friendly-ness and consistency with their drinks. EVERY time this stand makes the wrong drink they respond some stands make it different. Odd since I've been to grey hawk, Scottsdale, Glendale/51 and 7th st location the exact same drink and it tastes just fine. They even tried to tell me my favorite stand doesn't have a frozen rebel machine and that's why. No they do and it's better. Just saying it takes 1,000 years to move 3 cars thru the drive thru and your drink is wrong 100% of the time. Drive the extra 3 miles to Scottsdale and McDowell.",1
trn_3518,"3 stars overall...

Service. Food. Pricing.

Some of the food is quite delicious...such as the shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings are delish...

Others were an a-ok. Didn't like the pork stomach tips cuz they were a bit weird...the seating area is comfortable and a/c is turned on just right...

It's portraiting itself to be a posh restaurant but hard to say about how successful they are in that... 

No pressure to leave , watching game while being here. Which is nice. 

I gotta say Chinese dim sum places need to make more effort for better food. 

 Good for groups and private rooms also availible.",0
trn_3519,"My husband and I came here because it had amazing reviews (and quite honestly, we had a coupon). We were promptly seated in a lounge area and ordered the chicken and waffle and watermelon plate with a side of fries. The chicken was crispy and moist, but watch out for all the little bones! The waffle was also pretty good too. I love chicken and waffles, but thought this place didn't stand out from any other places I've been to across the nation. The hint of mint in the watermelon was nice and refreshing though!

The food came out quickly and the staff checked up on us frequently (though water refills were scarce).

Our favorite part of our lunch was the water glasses. We ended up finding them online and restocking our kitchen at home with them because we liked them so much.",0
trn_3520,"Came here with a big group of friends after we left Pkwy tavern since they were charging a fee to get in if you didn't reservations due to the rousey fight.  

Service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive since there was like 14 of us.  The drink were really good, I recommend the pear necessities. The food however wasn't really up to par for what they were charging.  The pizza was greasy and pretty bland even for ordering 3 different types of pizzas. French fries were good, the hot wing like cauliflower was okay. 

The decor and theme was interesting. Totally forgot about the solar systems we used to do for class. Overall, place is very hipster but it made for a good back up plan but closed too early for being a Friday night.  We ended up hopping over to dave and busters.",0
trn_3521,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I took my car in THREE days ago, when I called they said they would be able to get my car in right away, and so I took it in the early afternoon, they told me they would look at my car and call me when they knew what was wrong. Later on that day they said I was gonna have to leave it over night and they would call me the next day. Never called. I ended up calling 5 times , yes 5 times and they never returned my calls or told me what was wrong. The lady I spoke to even PROMISED me she would call before the end of the day. Lol. Nope. Cant keep their word for nothing. On the 3rd day they were finally able to tell me they could replace my thermostat but couldn't guarantee that would fix the problem,... which it probably would. Lol & they wanted to charge me over $200 just for that. That's way overpriced and a easy repair. Keep in mind I have a subie which are great cars. Anyways I was fed up, because I know for that it's anywhere from $90-130 I told them forget it. Went and got my car, it took them over 25 minutes to give me my car back and then they really tried to charge me a fee for the diagnosis, hahaha. You said your time wasn't free but me not having a car for 3 days wasn't free either. What a joke!! Never will I be back here or recommend my friends here.",-1
trn_3522,"Was excited to give this place a try but was disappointed. I tried the elk bleu burger it was very dry, chewy, and tasteless I wasn't able to eat it. I never had elk before some maybe I didn't know what to expect but I thought it would at least have more flavor than it did. I did really enjoy the fries especially with the ginger ketchup and the onion rings were crispy and good. Basically the sides outperformed the main dish. If I Try this place again I will definitely be choosing a different burger.",-1
trn_3523,I was recently introduced to Diego Pops and I'm now craving it everyday. The happy hour here is incredible!

Everything is a must here and I'm excited to come back more.,1

trn_3525,"I'm going to make this short, because honestly this place isn't even worth the time I'm taking to write this review. Husband and I waited outside for 15 - 20 minutes and then seated in front. Awkward bench seating at two wobbly tables pushed together. Server was very friendly and coffee was great....that's about where our enjoyable experience ends. Waited quite a while for such a small place. Got the wild blueberry pancakes that had no flavor and were tough, over-mixed, and overcooked. Husband ordered the typical, nothing fancy breakfast - brown on the outside and way to soft on the inside scrambled eggs, way over peppered and tough sausage (they make it there, which would be great if they actually tasted good), home fries burnt and inedible. He couldn't stomach any of it and sent it back with another server and I ate one of the four pancakes. It was bad enough that the food was your typical over-hyped yupster garbage, but what really pissed me off was that our previously friendly server didn't even come to see us when the other server brought the food back and obviously informed her of our dissatisfaction. I still left her a tip because I'm not an asshole, but she did nothing to earn it. Needless to say, we won't be back and we'll make sure to tell our friends.",-1
trn_3526,The coconut milk mango pudding...the best! Shrimps rolls and dim sum is good. Nothing too special aside from the hours!,1
trn_3527,"I like the Island Cafe because for one, the food is fresh. They have a smoker so they smoke their own meats and salmon. This is the best spot to eat in the entire island. It's cute, cozy and the food is good BUT, the staff needs to look a little bit more presentable and clean. We've been there several times and it's always the same. The other day there was a waitress that looked a little too dirty for my liking. She had bug bits all over that were bloody (SO gross),and her clothes looked dirty. If it wasn't for the staff looking a little too raggedy, I'd give this place 4 stars! Please please have the staff clean up a little bit. It's a big turn off for such a nice place.",0
trn_3528,I go to Water Mart for my ice cream and the Frys next door for my water. The owner George is one of the coolest and nicest guys you will meet.

trn_3529,"I have eaten here twice and each time the sushi (chefs choice) platter was excellent.  As with anything on the LAs Vegas strip, it was pricey but delicious.  Be prepared for a walk as Sushi Samba is in the back of the Palazzo but it's worth the walk.",1

If you guys are craving McDonalds go to another one a few blocks away, you'll be glad you did.",-1
trn_3531,"No longer called Koi, has changed name to Sumo (and their weekend happy hour is no more.)

My wife and I sought out Koi because we remembered it being very good and the specials were also great.

Well, the specials are gone, but the food is still good. The reason Koi gets three stars today though is due to the horrible smells inside the building, like someone had started a fire in a deep fryer. It also doesn't help that the venue itself is downright tiny.

The high prices aren't helping it too much either, and I don't appreciate the lack of clear information updates on any of their internet listings (Still labeled as Koi everywhere I can tell.)

So, really, Sumo Sushi isn't bad. The service is good, but with a big city like Phoenix where competition is stiff and good sushi is all over the place, there really isn't anything about it setting it apart or driving me to return anytime soon.",0

Sweet people and good fresh food and coffee. My fav local brew.",1
trn_3533,"I just think this place is okay.   First of all don't tell me it is a 15 minute wait and make us wait 45 minutes.  I should of just walked away after 30.  The food is just like any other burger place.   

Our friend hand a hankering for their burger.   Once he was finished he wasn't impressed this time around.  I had the chicken sandwich with fries, again just like any other sandwich.   Friends ordered the baby back ribs and they weren't impressed.   My husband did enjoy the wings.  I waited 15 minutes a a refill so service sucked.

trn_3536,"Great food and a great atmosphere. We were visiting Vegas from the Phoenix-area and were looking for a place that was a little different. And we found it!

The filet was good.  Portions may be a little small for some. If you are hungry, you may want to invest in some appetizers or sides. Or, better yet, get some dessert. We paired the triple layer chocolate cake with a scoop of the sea salt caramel ice cream, per a recommendation from our waitress. It was an excellent choice.

The restaurant is a little distance from the Strip, which is good or bad depending on what you are looking for. We did run into A LOT of traffic trying to get back to the strip. Luckily we planned lots of time before our show. 

I definitely recommend Honey Salt for something a little different in Vegas.",1
trn_3537,"Winner winner chicken dinner! This place is great! 

Food: We ordered the fine fried chicken with the honey hot sauce, butter lettuce with grill mango salad and peach cobbler. The fried chicken was the best. Crispy, juicy and tasty as hell. The salad was okay but the smoke pecans and grilled mango was good. The peach cobbler, one word: HUGE!! (Also takes 25 min to prepare so order ahead. )

Service: Our server was fantastic! Quick and friendly. You can make a reservation on Open Table right before you go and skip the line. You can also pay for your meal through the Open Table app too!!",1

It's got every kind of electronics. But it's also got things like Play-Doh and every item ever sold on TV late at night. Every item ever. Ever. And that is easily my favorite aisle. I can totally justify why I need each and every one of those items. The staff are nice. The checkout process is relatively smooth and easy. Whatever it is you need, Fry's probably has it.

The menu is very confusing and it's hard to distinguish what you're getting. Does it come with fries, or salad or tabbouleh? It's all guess work.

I live out of town and come to Vegas every month. This is the second time I've come here and if it wasn't for the fact that I'm middle eastern and enjoy the food I do t think I'd come back.

It's a small restaurant in the strip mall on the northwest corner of Stephanie and Horizon Ridge. Most likely the owner, Raymi, will be present to greet you and provide service for your meal. Always friendly, and eager to provide suggestions, he'll help you find something to your liking. The menu is filled with traditional Peruvian takes on proteins of chicken, beef, and seafood also using ingredients like yucca, plantains, yams, and the aji chili to compliment those proteins.

Lunch specials are $8.95 and come with a cup of soup. You'll get some corn nuts with an aji sauce to snack on when you first sit down. Be careful, there's no subtlety with that aji chili, it'll hit you right away. I've had the arroz con pollo and the aji de gallina on my most recent visits for lunch. The former dish had a nicely cooked, flavorful chicken thigh, but a  ton of rice (get this dish if you're looking to carbo load). The aji de gallina consisted of chicken breast with a spicy cream sauce and steamed rice, definitely my favorite of the two. Other dishes I've had in the past that I've been pleased with were the ceviche de pescado and the lomo saltado.

Prices are slightly elevated and service has been consistent. With Latin and Asian influences, Mi Peru can be a nice change of pace from your regular dining rotation and may be worth a visit to discover something new.",1
trn_3551,"I cannot recommend Paul Kerzner at Above & Beyond Acupuncture highly enough!!! I pursued acupuncture therapy and have benefited greatly in physical healing as well as spiritual and emotional growth. Paul is deeply intuitive and is able to address a spectrum of ailments, pain, blockages.... on both the physical and non-physical level. Pursuing healing with Paul is a decision that one will benefit highly from.",1

Food was pretty good, but the speed of service and attentiveness was just terrible. They weren't even THAT busy. It's not like there was a Tribe or Cavs or Browns game that night, just the Night Nation Run race. If it were up to me, I would have walked out. If it's a choice between this location and the one at 1301 East 9th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, go to the one on East 9th, which is nicer, anyway.",-1

I tried on a couple of 40J bras in different styles that she kept giving me over the curtain. When I finally found one that felt right on my chest she came in and looked at the fit, confirming that it was correct. I'm really happy with the new bra overall and the service that I received. It's really nice to not feel like a bowling ball is sitting on your chest all the time.",1
trn_3560,"Place is still ok...the lights were turned up this time and I saw the restaurant in its full glory. It's clean, but a little dusty here and there. Service was fast and friendly and I forgot they served Pepsi...and none of these 8oz glasses of pepsi, either. We're talking, plastic cup, chug a lug cuz you're thirsty kind of big - I was looking the glass and was thinking, ""Is this a 40 oz diet pepsi goodness?!""

The food was so-so. It hit the mexican food craving since Rosa's was closed on a Sunday. Damn you, Rosa's!

This is still an ok place for me to eat, but I won't deliberately go there unless all other mexican food options are exhausted -- and I will choose Rosita's over Serrano's any day.

ps
Did I mention they have big glasses of Pepsi?!
Oh yea, the no windows thing still freaks me out.  :D",0
trn_3561,"I decided to check this place out because I heard it was pretty kid friendly and had decent food. My friend was pretty upset the weekend before when she dragged out her two kids on a Sunday for some eats and was turned away at 6:30 for closing but I thought I'd give them a shot anyway. 

My husband and kid and I rolled in there to this really laid back atmosphere place that would never give you the impression that it was kid friendly if it wasn't for the other strollers in the restaurant and row of high chairs. 

The menus are cute and packed inside record sleeves and has such things like a Mac and Cheese boutique, yam fries, brie bake, hot pot, phud thai and calamari strips.

I had the yam fries and the mac and cheese with brie cheese with spicy beef and mushrooms.

The sweet potato fries (served with one of about 9 sauces - I had the piri piri) were hands down the best I've had in the city so far. 

The portions were great and tasty. I'll definitely be back there many times and bring back my friend's kids too to check out their kids menu.

trn_3565,"My dad came down to the area to visit, and while my wife and mom went shopping we decided to check out the ""grand opening"" of The Range at Lake Norman. Now I've been to shooting ranges before, and they have been rather lame. They were all outdoors where everyone had to shoot and check targets together, you had the sun baking down and blinding you and there were a bunch of crazy old guys shooting off huge guns just to feel cool. Needless to say I had some pre-conceived opinions of how I was going to enjoy my time at The Range, but luckily this place blows any range I've been to away.

It's an indoor, air conditioned range where everyone has their own little lane with barriers on both sides. Since it's indoors and the targets are automated (think of the targets you see in cop movies and shows) you go at your own pace and don't have to worry about keeping time with everyone else. 

One of the most important things to note about The Range is the staff. They were not only friendly but super helpful, and this is extremely important for anyone who is not familiar with handling firearms or with how a range works. My dad and I are both well-versed in firearm protocols, but since it was our first time there we were still made to watch the mandatory safety video. Anyone who doesn't feel comfortable after that is encouraged to speak with the staff for more in-depth rules. Also, if you just happened to go out and purchase a new gun and have no idea how it works, they are more than happy to walk you through it. Safety is the most important factor of firearms, and the staff is completely dedicated to making sure everyone stays safe by being easily approachable.

Also, The Range is very diverse in terms of who goes there. Rather than being full of a bunch of old guys there were groups of young guys, couples, families (I was surprised to see young girls handling firearms) and solo people all present and accounted for. Maybe it's a Southern thing, but you would NEVER find families (or even women) at a firing range up in New York. I think it's great, and I'm eager to come back and start introducing my wife to shooting. This is something I would never do at a range in New York, but I think she will feel very comfortable if we came here to do some shooting.

Now let's get on to the pricing. To rent one lane for the entire day is $17, or for $25 a day two people can share one lane. If you don't happen to have a firearm handy or want to try out a new model before buying it, you can rent them right at the counter. My father and I rented a handgun and it was only $8, which isn't bad at all. Now here's where things get pricey. If you don't have your own targets and ammo, they do sell it there, but it is marked up quite a bit. We spent $11 for the same box of ammo we could have picked up for under $5 in the store. So if you're there for awhile and blowing through several boxes of ammo it can add up quickly. Same goes for the targets...they have a large variety of them but they cost more than they would in the store. All in all, my dad and I spent a little over $70 to share a lane with one gun, two boxes of ammo and a pack of targets. On the plus side, they will supply eye protectors and ear muffs at no additional charge.

The Range at Lake Norman is a great place to do some target practice, whether you're a pro shooter or have no idea what the muzzle of a gun is. If you are the latter the staff are eager to help guide you through this new experience in the hopes of not only making you a safe firearms user, but also to get you hooked on this fun sport/hobby. The biggest thing keeping me from giving the place five stars is the price...if you don't have your own gun, ammo or targets the cost can rise up pretty quickly, especially if you're having a great time and blow through ammo faster than you realize. I'll definitely be coming back here, and next time my wife will be in tow.",1
trn_3566,"Was here for the grand opening and it was way worth the wait! No more driving down to avondale this is a perfect location. On the inside everything is even better.

Great music, great vibe. Basically no BULLSHIT

Highly recommend the lamb, it's a favourite of mine!
Simple and affordable favourite is the rigatoni and tomato sauce, you can order it off the menu and it's always great.
The shrimp and risotto is lovely too
Often I just have the rapini or asparagus side with a cocktail at the bar.

highly not recommended take your business elsewhere even at the cost of further transportation.

on many occasions i presented myself for my appointment, only to discover that they were AT LEAST 45 minutes behind schedule and i did not get any phone call or notification whatsoever to tell me so. 
On the 3rd occasion, I showed up and decided not to waste my time as there was also 2 ladies ahead of me, i would have been out of there in 4 hours. I rescheduled. They called me to say i did not show up and that i have to pay a fee. 
On another occasion I CALLED to say i would arrive 15 minutes late and the receptionist yells at me and insults me because ""the last time i did not show up"". at least i had the decency to advise of my tardiness. yet they cannot do the same when it is over 1 hour difference.
worst service i have ever experienced.

- you go there for one treatment and they bash other parts of your body saying you need more treatments. 
- they burn you
- they never answer phone calls
- condescending
- ITS A SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

trn_3574,"Simply outstanding! Mr. Fieri has proven himself once again as being this nations's premier chef. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all exceptionally good.

1) The ""Honkey Tonkey Double McBurger Blaster"" was phenomenal. The two beef patties were masterfully placed between two artisan created pieces of toast. Accompanying this sandwich was Guy's Ragin Flamin' splooge sauce that added subtle notes of hickory and leather.

2) ""Guy's Mozzarella Sticks"" were truly out of this world...possibly in the next universe. White cheese resembling mozzarella was delicately coated with a bread crumble that Guy calls Pano de coto. Simply outsanding!

3) ""Le Chicken Dubenaise"" was the star! A fully cooked chicken was presented table side and the waiter sliced each piece to your liking. It was then served with the most delicious Dubenaise sauce I have ever had.

This is THE destination restaurant on the strip.",1
trn_3575,"Love it. Tasty selection of Scottish and other craft beers and an array of whiskeys and scotch. The lighting is very dim (a tad too dim?) but this is certainly preferable to overly bright. They accommodated our reservation for 6 at the very last minute and managed to save us a table on a busy Thursday night. Also a comfortable place to grab a drink at the bar solo. 

I always though that haggis was ""gross"" but its actually quite delightful. Sort of like a meatloaf / shepherd's pie but with lamb, and better! The fish & chips are what you would expect: deep fried and filling.Our Scottish server was very Scottish - accent and all. She was patient with the late arrival of part of our group and invited us back for a whiskey event the following week. She was friendly and quite funny.

I will definitely return. Caledonian is ALMOST a 5-star but loses a point for a somewhat aggressive up-selling of additional drinks. Apart from that minor mishap, I am absolutely delighted and pleasantly surprised with The Caledonian.",1

Our server was fun and helped us come up with our choices. All were fantastic and we completely devoured them.

trn_3584,"We were on a quest for food at the Mandalay Bay on a Saturday night around 9:30PM.  It's surprising, but a lot of restaurants close at 10PM in Las Vegas, even though it's a city that basically operates 24 hours a day.  So we were afraid our options would be limited or ridiculously expensive.  

Enter RM Seafood.  It's right inside the Mandalay Place mall with two floors of dining - a regular dining room downstairs, and a chic lounge upstairs.  We sat upstairs, and the decor was eclectic but pretty.  They offer a sushi menu as well as a more traditional seafood menu.  Extensive wine list, lots of cocktails.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, even though they'd just had a mad rush of people before a Justin Timberlake concert.  They said they were still trying to clean up and recover, but we didn't really notice any flaws in the service.

I ordered from the sushi menu.  The edamame was flavored not just with salt, but also with lemon and a bit of hot pepper.  Very tasty!  I got a lovely albacore nigiri that melted in my mouth, and then two special signature nigiri orders.  There was arctic char with crispy shiitake, acacio honey, and fresh wasabi, which was slightly sweet but well-balanced and delicate in flavor.  And the ""ceviche-style"" scallop with citrus and avocado?  AMAZING.  I love raw scallops in my sushi, but this was just perfect.  Best I've ever had.  I was thrilled to have three buttery-soft, delicious scallops to savor.  I almost ordered a second round.

My dinnermate ordered the tea-smoked arctic char from the more traditional menu, and it was also delicious.  It had a nice, subtle smokiness and was served on a bed of cucumber, red onion, and a sauce that was reminiscent of tartar sauce.  The bread basket served with this contained tiny, perfect buttermilk biscuits.  I snuck a few bites of each!

We spent $60 for both of us without any drinks - which isn't outrageous for dinner in Vegas, especially when it included sushi.  It was a lovely, relaxed experience, and I'd be happy to return and savor some more scallops.",1

At the time of authoring, they only have a couple spirits (honey liquor, ozuo, and rum). They make cocktails from the spirits that they distill right in the distillery. Very concise menu, but of the cocktails I tried were yummy. Reasonably priced too.

The interior is pretty open, and has lots of wood and concrete. One complaint - there is no music, so it's pretty quite/tame. They need to amp up the energy here. I understand the ambiance is very chill, but they can do better.",1

The lady who did my nails was pretty gentle with filing my nails and clipping the cuticles, I usually end up sore after a pedicure cause people are too careless with the tools. So it was comfortable, she did a massage with a sugar scrub which towards the end almost burned cause she spent so long using it, but then she put a body butter all over my feet and legs and it immediately soothed them and felt great. Everything smells so good too! Picked out a pretty Essie color and she did a great job painting them too. I will definitely return, hopefully my next experience will be just as good.",1

They were kind and friendly, but didn't really shape my eyebrows and they basically looked the same as I would do myself. And they also didn't do the tinting because apparently they don't do that there?! Then spent 10 minute trying to convince me to perm my eyelashes for my wedding. I ended up spending too much money and had to go to another eyebrow place the day before my wedding. Overall- the concept is good and the people are friendly, but I feel like they should have more to offer in terms of shaping than just their standard shape!",0

It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night and I'm sure it's packed on the weekends. Overall, it's a solid place, the lounge area is very cosy and not loud (good for a few friends or a date).

trn_3598,"I've been meaning to write a review of The Platinum for some time, but in years past I didn't, as I wanted to save this little refuge from the hoards of people that eventually ruin closely held secrets. 

I've been staying at The Platinum for nearly ten years, always for a security conference which should be no surprise if you follow my reviews on Yelp. I am here more for business, and there's some time towards the end to decompress before getting back to the gun and run of business travel.   

Every year the quality and customer service gets a little worse, the only constant is the valets which know me by name. (Probably because I tip better than most guests staying here). When The Platinum first opened, there was a black Cadillac Escalade as the house car, Eventually, Marcus Hotels which runs the hotel portion here took the Caddy to Wisconsin and replaced it with a white Suburban, now it looks like a GMC. 

I have stayed in Marcus managed hotels in the past, a recent stay at the Hilton Madison Monona Terrace offered some of the best customer service and attention to detail that I've experienced in a long time.

Last year The Platinum was replacing the wallpaper and carpets, and they didn't think that was an issue, other hotels would just close the floor and bring in the workers to get things done ASAP, not at The Platinum, This year I knew I would be doing lots of walking, lots of lugging giant boxes of 72 shirts for the hacker conference at Bally's and my luggage for attending five hacking, security, and venture capital conferences. You try lugging a Pelican 1650 around a hotel after flying 4+ hours to Las Vegas.

I booked off the website, I requested a strip view, and ideally a corner room which is close to the elevators. 10 years of staying here either with friends, other companies, and agencies, I called ahead asking for this and was told I'd find out when I checked in. I figured there would be some loyalty with keeping a long-time customer happy.

Nope....

I did get a strip view, but not without making a giant U to walk to my suite, this gets really old after about the second day of a 7+ day business trip. Other commentators have mentioned the rooms aren't all that clean, I took one look at the tub and scratched the idea of soaking my legs in the jetted tub, the shower wasn't the grossest shower I've used before, but could use a regrouting to cover up the mold. 

If you're considering eating in your suite, ask for a bottle of Dawn and wash all of the eating utensils and plates, I was thinking about making some overnight oats for breakfast and was just grossed out by everything, the knives outright grossed me out and I scratched that whole plan. 

After you've walked 10+ miles a day, more than a few days in a business suit in August, all you want to do is call for room service, maybe do a load of laundry, look over the menu, find some nice comfort food to settle into some reports. Only to learn from the front desk that room service ends at 11pm, the front desk was a little swarmy about this, as they said it should be mentioned in the menu (It doesn't) and recommended a bunch of pizza joints that deliver. 

Unlike most of the other Americans staying at The Platinum that week, I don't want to be average sized (or larger) stuffing my face with pizza. I would think someone could find other healthy eating options for delivery after room service closes for the night. 

Kil@wat, the restaurant on the fifth floor that likely closes at 11pm has breakfast, I'd recommend that you don't eat here if you are in a rush, they should really call it Kill@nHour as there might be four couples eating but it always takes 20+ minutes to get an omelet. 

I don't know if any of the managers have stayed in The Platinum as a secret shopper, maybe they could figure out why it is that you can use a bathroom sink, the other one gurgles for a few seconds afterward. I've stayed at plenty of hotels in over the years, The Platinum's bathroom sinks do this consistently.

TV remotes, the other commenters on TripAdvisor have pointed out that you have to mash on the keys to change the channel, and they are not kidding. 

Now after reading all of this, maybe you're thinking this is a fluke, or that this only happens to the Michelin Inspector in 'Oceans 13', What should I know if I want to stay 2-8 days at The Platinum on your own dime?

Strip Views are ideal as long as you're at least 10 floors up, so you can't hear the AM/PM and 7/11 mini-marts nearby but also mitigates the ambulances which have a base over on the east side / mountain view and run Code 3 24/7. South views will either have a view of Ellis Island or McCarran Airport. Don't eat at Ellis Island after 11pm because room service is closed or you will be subjected to the worse karaoke you've heard outside of the Ginza Shopping District in a helluva long time while you try to eat a chewy $6.99 steak.

Friday afternoon (the night before we were supposed to leave) we received a call from ""Armin"" saying that the car would be an extra $40 if we wanted to pick it up at the airport.  He said if we could arrange transportation to his place of business in Peoria he would honor the promised rate.  

I told him that we had made arrangements with his employee to pick the car up at the airport but he said he couldn't honor this arrangement because it costs too much and his employee was ""new"" and didn't know better.

Fortunately Hertz had a car that they would have for us at the airport without the surcharge for airport pickup.  While I have nothing against Enterprise, I won't rent from the Peoria branch  on Cactus Rd. again.

Update:
I sent an email to the address that Nick suggested.  Perhaps something will come of it.

trn_3602,"Joined a girlfriend here for a quick bite after hearing so/so reviews.. neither one of us knew much about the place other than it was good food!

We sat at the bar upstairs at 5pm on a Tuesday; the bartender quickly and very happily made us two (delicious) mocktails (both of us are pregnant) and we were off to a great start. Not even close to a Shirley Temple; freshly squeezed juices and everything!! From there we split a burger, crostini with goats cheese/tomato salsa of some sort and the calamari; hands down best happy hour menu i have seen in a long time. there were so many choices to us those were the top three, well at least that our diets will allow at the moment.

To top it all off when the check came we were not left mind boggled as it totaled out at $23 and some odd change. It was a complete breath of fresh air from the likes of the fancy-pants places that think because they have fancy decor and are ""trendy"" they can change you upwards of $40 just because and don't give a hoot about ""happy hour"". We both left with full tummies and making plans for the next time to swing by! We will definitely be back, and hopefully next time sans babies.. their actual cocktail list looked amazing!",1

Husband had a burger and declared it delicious.

Car was washed while I waited for lunch and was gleaming when I picked it up and headed out with my bag of awesome food.  Amazing.",1

If you've read my other reviews you'd know I consider myself a nacho connoisseur of sorts.
Chips were fresh- not stale- which just Ruins a nacho plate. Plate was burning hot so I know it was fresh from the oven. Salsa and guacamole were both good. And the carne Asada was on point- 
I'll certainly be back-
OH! The host and Wait staff are Superb!! This really makes a good business in my mind - and I saw at least three young families here- so they're good with babies in children seat and cradles!",1

9/11/17 - Paid deposit, confirmed 10/14 appointment
9/27/17 - Luxe Appeal Studios receptionist called me stating that Alexis will not be working on 10/14. They asked if I could come on 10/12 instead. I repeatedly said I couldn't and asked for a refund. She said she spoke directly to Alexis and if I could come at 6AM on 10/14 instead of 8AM, she would be there to honor my appointment. I asked repeatedly if they were sure this would work because I am fine with getting a refund and going somewhere else. She assured me my appointment was still confirmed.
10/11/17 - Luxe Appeal Studios receptionist called and left me a voicemail confirming my appointment for 2PM on 10/12 (A date and time that I had no knowledge of or ever discussed) I called them back and Alexis apologized that she couldn't fulfill my appointment. They put my refund through but it will take 3-4 days before it posts back to my account.

trn_3611,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 4:30.  No wait and great service. 

I had the house and strawberry margarita and I can't decide which one I liked best.  The other guests felt the same way.   Both were very good.   We ordered guacamole to start, which was good but the chips are delicious.  I would have to say the best I've had.  I realize chips are a personal preference and everyone has their own opinion.   The wagon wheels were quite tasty too, but it's a good thing they are free because I don't think any of us would order them otherwise.  

Chicken enchiladas were the best meal out of the three we ordered.  The verde sauce was very good.

Griddled burrito was good, but the enchilada was better.

Tacos were tasty as well according to my dining partner.

The best thing about the whole meal was the Mexican street corn!  Wow.

When it is, there is often a second clerk behind the counter, doing something, but not checking people out.

They are also out-of-stock on LOTS of stuff, like all those balloons they have on display.  ""No, we don't have that one.  Don't have that one, either...""  Why have such a large store and not keep it stocked?

Finally, the associates there are sometimes a bit on the not-so-friendly side.  I won't go so far as to say ""rude,"" but they sure don't seem to be having a good day at work, and it shows.  They must not like working there...",-1
trn_3614,"This is the default studio for senior portraits at several schools.  So we made an appointment (and paid the sitting fee).

The photographer was nice.  He managed to get some good smiles, and so some good shots.  We had to come back a week later to see the results.  Overall they were good.

Then comes the ordering process.  Prices are quite high.  Not sure they are worth the extra cost compared to other studios.  I mean really really pricey.  Just a basic portrait package is in the hundreds.  If you want anything extra (canvas, etc) it's MANY hundreds.  It is literally 10x the cost of Walmart (though you have to provide your own photos there, and Walmart is Walmart...quality is not assured).

I would say their pricing here is 2x what it should be, when you consider the multiple poses and the photographer's time (over an hour).  I think part of it is that they know they ""got ya"" with senior portraits.

If I had it to do again I would probably investigate other studios and their pricing policies.  Senior portraits are important, but this was really painful.  

My star rating is mostly for the photographer.  If he were ""average"" I would probably rate this two stars, but he was very good at getting the subject to relax.",0

The only thing that was decent was the shrimp and crab legs.  So if you can eat $24 of this, then this is a decent place.  prime rib was chewy and under cooked, turkey was dry.  The deserts were bland and the service...well what service???  I will never go back.",-1

The food was tasty.  I ordered the lobster quesadilla which was delicious.  I'm not a big guac fan, but the quac they had on the side was great.  My friends got the pulled pork pizza and the stuffed chicken and they both really enjoyed their meals.

The menu was nice but I wish it was more extensive.  That goes for the wine selection as well.  I know it's the BEER bistro, but I feel there should have been more than 3 white wine selections for those who aren't a huge fan of beer.  

All in all, I had a tasty time and would go back.",0

trn_3624,"Boulangerie Kouign-Amann's version of the butter cake is served as a slice from a larger disk (different from the biscuit-shaped ones that I'm more familiar with in my home city).

It was crispy, crunchy, flaky, chewy, and almost juicy from all the butter that's in it! However, I prefer the biscuit shape as it's smaller and has a greater surface area, resulting in more crunchy caramelized bits on the outside.

Regardless of shape, kouign-amanns are still fun to say, and even more fun to eat!",0
trn_3625,"Awesome venue! Really spacious with lots of area to meander with a beer in hand. Limited tables for seating, but this is a place to be on your feet and enjoy the games. There are four game areas: 1) shuffleboard tables 2) indoor shuffleboard courts 3) outdoor shuffleboard courts 4) pop and shot b-ball game. We played on the shuffleboard tables and it's $3.50 per person per hour. Cheap entertainment in a fun environment. Pro tip: the shuffleboard tables are slick (at least relative to Hotz Cafe) so be gentle!

Apart from the games, the food/drank is also solid. Large cocktail menu and a good craft beer list with offerings from Rhinegeist, Jackie O's, Columbus, etc. Food menu is small, but tasty and designed for the active, social atmosphere. They had blue moon bakery serving handheld sandwiches and empanadas when I visited and I believe they will have a different pop-up serving food rotating every month.

Great addition to Cleveland! I'll be back to practice my shuffleboard skills.",1
trn_3626,"Although I miss my Paradise Café, I can still get some of my favorite things here at Panera.  This location is convenient when shopping or for a working day lunch.  Although Tempe Marketplace is a busy place, you can usually find parking not too far away on a weekday. 

My favorite is the 1/2 & 1/2 -  your combo choice of salad, sandwich, flatbread or soup.  I usually get the tomato soup, but opted for the Autumn Squash along with 1/2 a chicken salad sandwich.  The service was pretty speedy - they brought it to my table when ready.  Everything was tasty and fresh.   Just what I needed.  

I noticed they had iPad stations at the entrance for preorders, but I didn't take the time to check them out - they were being used, so will check that out on my next visit.",1
trn_3627,"I was a regular here, I've gone to this place sooo many times. But my last experience was horrible. I always go and see Charlie for my full set & fills. Even tho my nails would always break they looked great, so I continued to see him. I went in to get a fill with gel polish & he painted on a really thick layer of the gel polish, after the last coat you could tell the polish was dry on top but not underneath. He had me put my nails under the UV light for almost 15 mins straight. After that he attempted to drill off the polish & start over. After about 20 mins he gave up and had one of his coworkers finish while he went to the store to go shopping. Half an hour later this lady finally got the gel off & she painted my nails with one hand with a white base coat & the other without & you could clearly see the difference in color. After almost 3 hours my nails looked sooo bad, my hands were darker than my arms & damn near burning. On top of all this the lady that finished my nails over charged me because Charlie had left AGAIN and she wasn't sure of what services I received. This is how they treated a REGULAR. I would not recommend this place to anyone. You don't treat your clients like that.",-1
trn_3628,"All things considered, The Buffet gets a 4 in my books for the following: 

1) VALUE. For ~$33 during dinner time for a buffet with seafood, this is a pretty good deal. For the two of us during a weekday dinner, we paid roughly $75 total. Now compare this to the Ceasers, who charges about $60 per person. We aren't the wealthiest people, so we stuck to what was the more realistic option for us. I must say, it was a gamble because paying $33 for subpar seafood would have been awful. Luckily, their seafood rocked!

2) SALMON & TUNA NIGIRI. They had the freshest salmon and tuna nigiri- so juicy and thick. It doesn't even matter if they 'pack the rice' in the nigiri because you can just make it into the sashimi by setting aside the rice. They also have salmon and tuna poke (cubes of marinated salmon & tuna)

3) KING CRAB LEGS. Keep an eye out for those king crab legs. They also have regular snow crab legs, but the king crab legs have so much meat and just taste so much better. Both crab legs were always fully stocked. They cut the crab legs in half so it is easier to eat. I appreciated that! The melted butter is located in the soup section. It took us a few minutes to locate it. 

4) MEAT. They had the Kobe cuts available that I found to be very tasty. I complemented the dish with their mashed potatoes and asparagus. No other pairings needed! 

5) DESSERT. Holy moly, their dessert really topped off this meal just right for us. Their chocolate dome thing, coffee tiramisu, creme brulee, fruit tart, and ice cream with cookie were all so delightful. Order a tea or coffee to top off the experience. 

I wouldn't give 5 because everything outside of the list above was not that great. They had some hot Asian dishes with rice and Chicken tiki masala, but they just weren't that tasty. This was fine with me though since I came in with the expectation of eating a lot of seafood (ie, crab legs and sushi). If you're looking to tap into a buffet for the reasons listed above, The Buffet at Bellagio is the place for you!",1

After waiting almost an hour we called back to try an get a time reference. The person on the other end was short an said they were leaving in a few minutes. 20 minutes later we had the delivery and the person at the door yelled about how she had to wonder around to try and find the building and next time to put the information in better.

What I like about this outlet is that it is indoors (with an exception of a few shops outside in the ""promenade"" area) so no matter what the weather is outside, you can come here to shop and save a lot of coins/ cash on whatever you buy. 

This outlet is pretty similar to the Las Vegas Premium Outlet North, but the South outlet has 10 stores less and the South is all outdoors.

trn_3639,"I was really happy with this newly opened cafe, and can easily get over the few flaws that I found.
I had the combo which includes sandwich, soup, and salad for $8.79
I added the pomegranate coconut water green tea .
There are 13 sandwiches to choose from , 12 salads and 10 soups . You can also add deserts if you choose and they also look delish. 
Expect a large lunch time crowd here .
Here are the few drawbacks I encountered during my visit . At the time of this writing (April 2016) the cafe is newly opened. There seemed to be some minor confusion between the employees trying to match sandwiches to salads and soups for different orders. With time , this problem will fix itself .
The other drawback was a poor design of the cafe. Aparantly they don't have a back service entry door for deliveries. That means that the daily (because they use fresh ingredients) come through the same small door which customers are using . Awkward to hold up foot traffic for a pallet jack full of deliveries. Even more akward is they use this same customer entry door to wheel out the trash bins (yuck).
Aside from those two drawbacks ... I really enjoyed the food and will DEFINATELY come here again and again .",1

trn_3641,"Chops is a kosher resto located not far from snowdon metro. It's easy to find parking. Because it's certified kosher don't expect it to be open on a Friday night and Saturday night schedule does change depending on the season. The place has lots of sections which I find practical for special occasions. The down stairs is surrounded with good TV sets and music is not loud. The staff is super friendly and I recommend asking them for there opinion on what to order. I personally don't recommend sushi on a sat night since they don't accept deliveries on Saturdays. 
I don't agree on the ethnic comment. I've seen people of all ethnicities and with or without kippas (head cover). Everyone one is welcome there. I agree that there is a larger concentration of religious Jews but what do you expect when you have a handful of kosher restaurants in a city this large. 

I've been here several times for special events and find the price point a bit high but kosher meat is usually a bit more of expensive. Usually I would take the Krispy beaf. Flavours are nice, not spicy and quantity generous. Some people ordered the plate of pasta and complained of lack of flavour. Others found the grilled steak very good. 
This time I talking to some people and discovered there is a burger that's not on the menu. I orders it! Ask for the price because u shouldn't expect it to be cheap and for good reason. This burger is huge, stuffed with all kinds of flavours. A nice touch was the slice of roast beaf it added a smokey taste it.  I also asked for spicy spice on the side to add a bit of a kick. This burger was dripping and oozing so dry it's not!  The fries are an excellent choice but I had mine replaced with a salad, a great portion. It wasn't over seasoned or soggy. 
If you have room for desert just remember that it's a kosher meat resto so don't expect to find dairy items on the menu. If ur lactose intolerant then ur at the right place. Even the ""milk"" for ur coffee is non dairy. This is commonly found in kosher meat restaurants.",1

Mussels - rubbery

Smoked Salmon - actually really good

The gua bao was huge, but that was the only thing impressive about it.  Noodles were freshly made and tasted great!  I'd want to try the wider noodle next time.  We also got a green milk tea, which was much creamier (and tastier) than across the street.  Would definitely come by if we're in the area again!",1
trn_3657,"Part of me knew this before I took my first bite but, this just doesn't live up to the hype.  I mean, nothing really could live up to the hype built around this place! To be fair, it is great pizza.  I just isn't ""the best pizza"".  There are numerous places in San Francisco that would beat this one out.

Upon entering the restaurant, at noonish on a Sunday, we were surprised to see it half empty.  I was also surprised to be cheerfully greeted by Chef Chris himself!  For how slow the restaurant was, our table service was also slow.  We did get some yummy olives to eat while we waited, nice touch.

Our favorite pizzas were the sausage and the red onion/pistachio (I forget the names).  I would actually skip the famous margarita, I didn't think the flavor of the cheese or the sauce really shined through.

I think if I went back I would try one of their pasta dishes.  They serve a small entree menu, in addition to the pizzas, at this location.",1
trn_3658,"Phew, this place was hard to find. I was tearing down WT Harris at a mind-bending 40 mph (yay, traffic) and didn't see it in time. Not my fault though, trees have gone up in front of the distinctive red-and-white ABC Store sign so it isn't visible until you have passed the turn-off. Sneaky. I doubled back through a strip mall and, with a few questionably legal detours, found my way back to the store. I was glad to see that it hasn't been renovated into one of those depressingly cheerful corporate boxes. I enjoy metal bars and neon signs in my liquor store windows. It feels much more authentic.

So I saunter in, supercool. Nod to the clerk, ""Ma'am"" . But she calls me ""sweety""; my supercool bubble is burst. If I'd been close enough she would have pinched my cheeks. I fumbled around the store for a few minutes, trying to remember what I had wanted. She managed to call me sweety another half dozen times, tearing down my manly ego with each motherly drawl. Finally, reduced to a mere shell of a man, I dragged my purchases across her counter and skedaddled.

4 stars for the human encounter. No demonizing preacher here, like at other ABC stores, hatefully judging my purchases. This woman obviously enjoyed a touch of the giggle water from time to time. I appreciate that.",1
trn_3659,they have ceviche and all kind of mariscos(seafood). Tacos as well (duh). We got asada and tripe tacos...yum!!!,1
trn_3660,"I am pretty patient guy when i take a cheap flight but allegiant is by far the worst company i have ever flown with.

Way to vegas from junction plane was 1.5hrs late then leaving vegas to grand junction we were told we had to board an hour early. Then we didn't leave until scheduled time. Sat on the tarmack for 40 min because the proper paperwork to take off was not done with the airport. Of course the A/C didnt work. Ready for take off and now the hydraulic light issue causes us to change planes.   Not bad enough? Flight attendants were so  rude on both flights. 
Next time i will pay the $100 more. They obviously dont care",-1
trn_3661,"Awl. It's a good place. I go friday nights when the food is half off and the sake is half off. That includes the sushi. The sushi guys are so fun. Sit at the bar if you can. I'm not a sushi eater but my boyfriend is. So he had me try the one with eel, crab, tuna, salmon and some with yumyum sauce (which lives up to it's name) I normally order the edamami and the fried tofu in the miso soup which is sooooooo good. Also we order saki bottle after saki bottle. And it's cheap. We bring our friends and we all leave under 15. That is we are all drinkers. So if you don't drink! It's cheaper!
A note though. Half off starts at 10. I reccommend you get there by then. I've shown up at 12 with no where to sit! The place is small! But quaint.

trn_3662,"If you are family planning and looking for a reproductive endocrinologist in town, please consider Green Valley Fertility Partners and Dr. Fisch! They are a full service fertility practice conveniently located in Henderson. Dr. Fisch was medical director for years at Sher Fertility and recently opened up a new practice in Henderson. 

I consulted with Dr. Fisch after being a patient at one of the larger fertility practices in town. I was seeking a second opinion, someone closer to home, and a more personalized and supportive experience. GVFP provided all of that and more. 

I had a wonderful consultation with Dr. Fisch and, at my first meeting, he spent so much time answering questions and explaining physiology relating to fertility, options, and different approaches. Unlike the previous doctor I worked with, he took time to listen to my concerns and ideas, and took them into account when developing my plan of care. I was made to feel like an active participant and decision maker in my plan of care, and that meant so much to me provided I work in the healthcare field. 

The entire staff communicated with me in a professional and courteous manner and I always felt like I was in good hands. Whenever I called, I spoke to someone immediately, or within minutes I would receive a call back. I never waited hours or days to have questions answered and everyone - from the medical assistant, to the RN, to the doctor himself - was completely accessible. 

Fertility and family planning is a very sensitive and important topic for some, so I encourage you to work with a team who is comforting and supportive. I urge you to consult with Dr. Fisch and see how GVFP is different from the other full service fertility practices in the valley. You'll love this team! And as I prepare to start my own family, I am so thankful to have found them!",1
trn_3663,Shhhhhh! Don't tell anybody or this place will be packed 7 days a week & there will be a line out the door. The menu is pretty simple but there's enough options to make anyone happy. Food is fresh & flavorful. Prices are super reasonable and portions very generous.,1

trn_3665,"This is going to be a long review, unlike the service we experienced!! I came upon this company by pure accident, thought it was Leslie's. At any rate, Amy was incredible when I gave her a water sample and she gave me instructions with everything to do-well done!! My other half and I decided to use their pool service, as it was a family owned business and we are all about supporting the little guys. There came a point where we needed new filters, to which we purchased them from Sea Turtle and Mark even came to our house to help install them correctly, for that I commend you, although when I got a phone call (we reside in Canada) indicating those filters were all cracked and needed to be replaced, I inquired about some kind of warranty, to which we were told- since THEY did not install them, there was no warranty (less than 6 months) HHMM, but Mark WAS at our house!! Anyways, the other half came back to Arizona in December and was shocked with all the debris in our skimmer basket, but gave them the benefit of the doubt. I came down in January, and in about March I felt my pool was not being cleaned properly, so will my blinds all closed and everything put away, I watched through a window as the pool service person came into my yard, went around to where the pumps etc. are and he never came from around there for 7 minutes-7 minutes!!! And that's only from the time I decided to time him!!! He then comes back to the pool, grabs his bucket and poles and leaves!! Like are you kidding me!!!! So I immediately get on the phone and get the assistant manager (Sabrina) and tell her what happened and asked for Kathy to which she was not at the store yet, but she would give her the message and get a hold of Kathy's son, Nathan and find out what's going on. Sabrina phones me back and says he is doing another pool but will come back as soon as he is done, to which I ask, ""What did he say when you asked him about not doing anything here?"" She said he admitted to doing nothing here. He comes back, does a 3 minute job and leaves. Kathy phones me later on that day, and all she can say is ""Sabrina did the right thing by asking Nathan to come back."" WOW, seriously!!!! She had no ownership or accountability. This is YOUR business, family or not!! Then she tells me that she has gone with him several times and he always does a great job! Ya think???!!!! Then she tells me she is going to come with him the next time to make sure he does everything right. So I asked about brushing the walls down, and she says she doesn't instruct him to do the walls until April-WTF!! Of course I had already paid for service until the end of March (he came 2 more times), but Kathy never came with him. On the last day, we asked for the gate key back and informed him we wouldn't need his services (or should I say, the lack there of!!) I phoned the store 3 times and no one answered so I sent an e-mail to Kathy telling her not to run my card the first of the month. Her reply was "" She couldn't come and check if everything was done right because she had to look after the store, disagreed with me saying she was unconcerned, Nathan was having issues that day, and we did have him go back."" Ownership and accountability lady, no wonder you closed your store in Tolleson!!!",-1
trn_3666,"This place is amazing! I came to the open mat one Saturday with ZERO experience in jiu jitsu and the amazing and kind hearted Roxanne Modafferi rolled with me and taught me the basics. Everyone there was so understanding, helpful and encouraging. 

This btw is a regular occurrence, if you are not training with a profession fighter you are at a bare minimum being coached by one! It's a great experience!

Highly recommended for beginners, amateurs, pros, women, men, children, hell they even have a 70 year old jiu jitsu badass training there!",1
trn_3667,Gross... overpriced breakfast. $27 for two people! Nothing tasted very good. My omelette was super dry. My husband got a bonus egg shell in his salad. A manager was supposed to come talk to us about it... Never saw them. It was removed from the bill so it would have been over $30 for gross breakfast. It took a long time to get our good too.  Host was unfriendly. Waitress was sweet.,-1

trn_3669,"First time here, great experience!

I loved the menu!  Many options for gluten-free and veg.  They had just rolled out a new Mediterranean menu for the summer that day.  I wanted to try everything!  Nice wine selection with my favorite....Ste Michelle Riesling!  Hard to find here.

We arrived at Happy Hour (3-6).  All Tapas were half off and our wine was $2.00 off a glass.   We ordered the duck tacos and chicken satay.  Our waiter brought out a bread basket and served us sourdough and a flatbread (you have to request the bread we found out).  The sourdough was AMAZING!  I usually skip the bread but wow!  So soft and moist in the middle with a crispy crust.  The flatbread had a great flavor with garlic and caraway seeds. very good.  

Tapas:

Duck Tacos- FABULOUS!  The duck was cooked to perfection, the shell was so crispy and light.  The toppings w/sour cream and goat cheese were perfect with it.  My boyfriend has never tried duck before...now this is his favorite :)
Chicken Satay-  Very good, nice spice and amount of peanuts in sauce.

Meal:

Chinese Chicken Salad- Exactly how it's supposed to be made!  i haven't had one this good in many years.  So many ingredients in it, I can't even list them.  Nice and spicy too.

New York Style Pizza-  high quality pepperoni and salami, the sauce was my favorite.  Great flavor and tasted homemade.  The crust had a great taste but was a bit 'wilted'.  It might have been our toppings.  I will try another next time.

Aside from the great food which we really enjoyed....our waiter Steve was the absolute best !  He genuinely wanted us to have a great experience. He was warm, friendly and attentive.  And because it was our first time...brought us the Messy Sundae for free!  nice touch!

We will be back as much as possible!",1

This place rocks when it comes to consistency I frequent here often for lunch..you can always get a seat and the waiters are friendly. You can order your sub hot or cold on all different types of breads or rolls (onion roll highly recommended). Deli meat is cut fresh big PLUS. Don't forget to ask for the horseradish mustard it is amazing.",1

trn_3672,"Overall, I do like this place. In terms of decor and a change of scenery in calgary I think it's great. My biggest issue with Sassi is the staff. Every time I come here, I hope that the service will be better, but I keep running into the same issues. It can take a while to be greeted at the door, sometimes it takes a while for the servers to come to take your order, and the level of service during the meal can be hit or miss. 
Last Saturday we dined here and there were little things that happened where you could tell the servers weren't very professional, I.e. After our entrees came out, the server brought our cutlery and placed them up against our plate, partly hanging off our plate and the table. Then the knife would slip a bit (why did you place it here to begin with?) and she would try to make it sit against the plate.... Then, nobody ordered wine and when our mains arrived and the table was tight, she didn't think to clear our empty wine glasses to make room for us....There were times during the meal that I had to find her to ask for more water... eventually we got a pitcher which was great but why did I have to repeatedly ask. 
At the end of the meal, she apologized on how slow she was during the course of our dinner and proceeded to tell us that she was so overwhelmed because it was a busy night..... it was a typical Saturday night and the restaurant wasn't fully packed. 
I want to like this place, I really do. I want it to survive and do well in mission because there are some positives too. I just wish they would focus on improving the level of service and maybe put the servers through some basic training.  My only other thing would be the menu items. It's nice when a restaurants changes the menu (or just a few items) from time to time. Often times their ""specials"" are items from the main menu!! That defeats the whole purpose of a specials list.",0

Unfortunately three kids all under the age of 6 with me would not allow me to do that. I will be sure to get a baby sitter before my next trip to the store which will be soon. You can really feel the passion of the owners for their products and I urge people that love food to check out this truly unique experiance.,1

This is my new favourite Hakka dish along with the crispy ginger beef.  So crispy and tasty with the onions, garlic and pepper.  You have to try it dry because I think too much sauce would just make for a soggy texture and would become boring after a few spoons.",1
trn_3683,"Nom nom nom nom! That's what my tummy was saying after lunch today. I'm pretty sure it'll say the same thing when I did into the leftovers of my lunch combo later this evening.

Dragon Pearl's been in Inglewood for ages. Seriously! Word is Ian's pushing 30 years in the neighbours. If you've walked passed it in the past, stop in for a bite next time your in the 'hood instead of going on by.

The interior is modestly decorated, dark red-ish walls and paintings to match, two large circular tables, and then perhaps a dozen more smaller settings. The tables are each set with a bowl, plate and chopsticks. No cutlery here right off the bat, although my server asked me if chopsticks were fine or if I'd prefer to have a fork.

I came in for a late lunch and was greeted and immediately seated (as tends to happen with late lunches). My server was as friendly as genuine as they come. Dragon Pearl's got a variety of lunch combinations, all are served with rice and your choice of won ton soup or a spring roll for $9.50. I ordered the chicken cashew dish with a spring roll and a pot of jasmine tea. I love that my whole pot of tea was only $1!

My rice came in its own rice thermos, and the chicken cashew dish was big enough that two people could've easily shared it. The spring roll was fresh with a nice crunch to it when I bit in.

Yummy food, more than decent prices... you might just make a regular out of me Dragon Pearl.",1

I gave stars for the taste and presentation of the food, but please be warned, it's pricey. Probably won't go back again.",0
trn_3688,"The food is usually very tasty and vegetarian friendly. The spinach pasta salad is great and is such a large serving its more than enough for two people. 

The Veggie burger is delicious and I usually order it with both sauces on the side. It comes with roasted red pepper on it which gives it a meaty taste almost. I definitely recommend the Veggie burger for not only vegetarians but for meat eaters also.  

I advise against the Caribbean salad--When I ordered it the fruit tasted funky and there were like 2 strawberries on top of a heaping large platter of fruit. My friend ordered it a second time and the fruit tasted spoiled. This is the only dish I've tried here that I didn't enjoy.  

The only reason I give this place 3 stars rather than 5 is due to the service... which SUCKS! The waitresses and waiters take forever to come to your table and take your orders. Last time I ate there my friends and I wanted salads and people that came in AFTER us were served their food before we could even ORDER. Every time i eat at this place I kick myself for even tipping the worst waitresses I've EVER encountered. I've had better service at crap diners like the Waffle House.

 I've been to this location countless times because it's around the corner from my house and there aren't many vegetarian places in Gilbert, but I started ordering take-out orders because the service is so terrible. Even the cashier is rude and ignores people when they're standing there asking for their order information!

trn_3697,"I'm a Starwood member and because of that feel obligated to stay at SPG hotels when I can to get points and build status. In the past, I've  also stayed at Starwood properties (now a part of Marriot) because they are great. I fly a bit to Toronto and find the Sheraton to be convenient and a Starwood property so I stay there - but I don't enjoy it. There are pros and cons but overall all its the utility that brings me here and that doesn't inspire. 
Pros: Great gym, nice continental breakfast with views if you are a platinum member, very good LG televisions with a great movie selection. The rooms also have outlets on the bedside table - iThe staff is friendly but at times robotic but they seem to mean well. The hotel is huge and for that reason a frequent choice for conferences - so it's often packed and the price per night is reasonable. 

Cons: The hotel is ugly but a durable concrete that will probably withstand an air attack. The rooms are uninspiring even with the 10s of millions of renovations. The bath products (Shine) are terrible. The food options are average. On a recent stay I had the pleasure of electricity going out twice in the bathroom because of a tripped circuit breaker. The wireless is infuriating and spotty and overall terrible in rooms - I was told to go outside in the hallway and hold my phone up to the wireless routers to log on - but you are periodically kicked off.

trn_3701,"Best place to get Sushi in the valley - Hiro works there!!!  

I used to go to 'the Lobby' for lunch with some customers a lot, and it has always been really good.  When Shiro closed, this became our family sushi place, too.  Then, one day, (Oct 15, 2013, to be exact), we dropped in and there was Hiro!!!  (If you used to get sushi at that place by the Biltmore way back when, that's the Hiro I'm talking about - check my photos - there's a shot from when we found him)

OK, enough fan worship of the Valley's best sushi chef, let's get down to the review.

This is a nice, friendly place on the west side of town.  They have sushi and sashimi, along with a full menu of noodles, tempura, etc.

The fish is consistently very good here!  And all the guys behind the counter do a great job with it (not just Hiro).  The serving staff is also very friendly and attentive.

Why did this become the family sushi place?  Because of what my wife calls ""Chick Rolls"" - things that aren't 'traditional'.  If you like some maki, this is a great place to try some really fun, creative and tasty rolls!  I like the What the Heck roll - very spicy.  The Volcano roll is a crowd pleaser (and comes with lots of healthy veggies mixed in with the scallops and crab).  My wife and daughter's favorite, though, is the Sex on the Beach roll.  This is Maguro (Ahi) on top of a fried banana (and I'm not sure what all else).  The ladies love it!  (This is the first non-California type roll to start expanding my daughter's world of sushi, so I'm into their debt for opening up her palate to more kinds of fish!  :-))

I can't believe I've never reviewed the Lobby before...I guess I'm a recovering Yelp slacker...

Anyway, run - don't walk, to Tokyo Lobby.  If you're not sure what you want, just sit at the bar in front of Hiro and tell him to hook you up - tell him I sent you.  My son and I have entrusted many a tasty sushi meal to his talents and recommendations.",1

trn_3707,"I ordered eggs, bacon, hash browns, and a biscuit. They brought back a plate filled with large portions of each and everything tasted great! I also had a side of the country potatoes and those were flavorful as well! To drink, I had orange juice which was freshly squeezed and homemade! Good, but a little warmer than I would have liked. Overall, it was a great breakfast!",1
trn_3708,"I love to go this place on my day off. This is a nice median size cafe and cake shop. 
It is pretty much Korean cafe style which I love the most because they not only making dessert for coffee like any other cafe out there. They also bake lots of bread with different flavor, I buy a lot every time I go and have it as my breakfast in the morning.
The way I love to enjoy myself there is order a latte with a fruit cake (love it) and stay for awhile. The staff are nice but they don't have much employee, so they don't have much time to interact with customer, which is understandable.",1
trn_3709,I have only had coffee/tea but i think its a cool place.  Nice and comfortable to either read or have a talk.  Service is very fast and friendly.  Nice selection of beverages.,1
trn_3710,Love love love we had breakfast here every morning while visiting family in the area. I really wish we had one near our home in California. The food was amazing and the place was clean. The staff was super great and friendly.,1

trn_3713,"So happy I tanned there. I was in town for the weekend. I own a tanning salon back in Boston but didn't plan ahead for a tan. I was looking for an Airbrush Tan. I know what I wanted. I didn't want a UV tan. That gem of a girl Courtney answered the phone. She sold me on their High Pressure bed.  Now as a client : I was received well when I came in, I was showed around and explained all of the units & tan times. I was helped to pick a lotion for before and after tanning. I was offered a discount ( that's always good ). The place was clean, the bulbs felt strong. I was happy.

Now as an owner of a salon here is my review: Courtney was exceptional on the phone. Upbeat, informative & persuasive. She had that place clean, I mean REALLY clean. How do I know? I looked really looked.  Another feather in her cap? She sold me on an after lotion! I know better, I know that with a good tanning lotion an after lotion isn't necessary. Didn't stop her from telling me that I could use it after my shower. I witnessed her with 3 or 4 customers while I was there. She was fast & courteous with them all being sure they all had eyewear & lotion. Bottom line? If that girl ever moves to Boston I am hiring her!",1
trn_3714,"Probably the worst McDonalds ever. I go here because it's close but would definetely avoid it if I had other options. Service is incredibly slow. One time they even ran out of eggs during breakfast so I couldn't order an egg mcmuffin lol. Today I went in and tried to redeem one of those coffee cards for a Frape. They denied my request even though EVERY single Mcdonalds has allowed me to get a Frape for one of those coffee cards (afterall, it IS the same price as their specialty beverages...even less $$). The manager was extremely rude. I ordered a medium coffee with 1 cream and 1 sugar...they gave me a large with SO much sugar in it...I didnt notice this until I was half way home /my coffee had cooled down for me to take a sip. Overall, worst Mcdonalds ever.",-1
trn_3715,"In town for spring break and needed a wax before going to the pool.  Kaitlyn did an amazing job - especially since it'd been awhile.  She was great to talk to - took my mind off of things. She was very thorough, gave me tips for after-care. Receptionist was very friendly.  The salon is very well-decorated -love the pin ups on the wall, cute seating area. Clean, friendly, great price. Will be back!",1
trn_3716,Always clean. Always get an awesome leg and foot massage. Gets busy on the weekends so if in a rush make an appointment.,1
trn_3717,"In town for business and decided to give this place a try. I wasn't disappointed one bit! Great selection of taps and, based on the recommendation of Damien, I had the Kentucky Bourbon burger. It was very good! Luke and Damien are a couple of cool guys as well.",1
trn_3718,"Greenberg's Deli is part of the food court area of the New York New York Hotel. To me, it was the best looking restaurant in this area.  A great variety of sandwiches...and fresh!  Service was prompt and friendly...nothing over the top special. 

I ordered the Smoked Ham sandwich...YUM! On the other hand the potato salad was not good.  It was so blah...with no flavor.  Good thing the sandwich made up for that.  Would consider stopping by if I was every in Vegas again.",1
trn_3719,Their menu is not very vegan friendly but the chef made me a special vegan pasta. It was AMAZING. Still craving more of it. Will def be back!,1
trn_3720,Good choice for a Japanese restaurant in Cleveland! It's  not a 5 stars because we have a lot of excellent Japanese restaurants in São Paulo (Brazil) may be I'm to critical.  But actually Sasa overdue my expectations. Thank you for the great dinner.,1
trn_3721,"I'm so excited KIKO is finally coming stateside & we are lucky to have one here in Vegas :)
This is my favorite make up store, the only other place I saw it was in Ibiza town and I used to go there a lot. They have mostly all the same stock as over in Europe and pleased to see the prices are just as affordable. Walking into the shop you would expect the prices to be a lot higher especially with the quality of of the products. Tried & tested the quality is as high as many over-priced designer brands in my opinion. 
*if you've got a big night out planned and want to get a full face of make-up professionally applied they do it in store for $40* way cheaper than what your hotel salon would charge on the strip. FYI
The cashier told me they are planning to open another in Forum shops (Caesars) soon.",1
trn_3722,We had my daughters bday party here and they did a great job! Loved having the whole gym to ourselves :-) My daughter said it was the best birthday party she's ever had!,1
trn_3723,I'll have to say I love the experience at k-on. The guy who's running the place is a super nice person. He responded to all our requests fast and were ready to have friendly conversation with us.  I definitely prefer the touch screen than the number key system. It's so much easier to choose what I wanna sing. I thought all they had were mandarin songs. But actually there are plenty in English.,1
trn_3724,"Great place! They play an excellent mix of music from top 40 to bachata to salsa , merengue. The crowd here is great, bartenders/dj/staff is very nice. Lines are about 15 minutes so you get in real quick, plus guys pay a cover of only $10 and ladies are in for free, plus they have a large area of seats and free re-entry!

Needless to say we stayed til they closed at 4, and we had a great time. I will definitely be going back!",1
trn_3725,"We got to see Garth Brooks. We went to the late show. When we arrived they had a holding area open with drinks, live entertainment, food, and vendors. Everything was pricey but fair. We walked nearby to ""the park"" and enjoyed the kitschy games, entertainment and variety of food options. It was lit up with art and colorful signs. We had cheap seats at the arena; however, I don't think there is a bad view. The escalator is a little steep but appreciated. Getting into the show was nuts. Just too many people, trying to get through security and not enough doors. They were well staffed and I really enjoyed that they had T-Mobile cel phone charging stations. The show let us in an hour late and started and out late, but was worth it. Annoying, when we bought our water (for 7.00) they took the caps Because apparently in the past people threw caps at artist???? Overall, a great venue, I hope to return soon. I must say 20 parking at Monte Carlo pissed me off but that's for another review.",0
trn_3726,"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.

This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.

I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.

Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.

We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.

For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.

My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.

There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.

We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.

All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!",1
trn_3727,"Had the fish and chips. Wasn't worth $15. Beer wasn't that cold. 

Would I go there again? Maybe. Just thinking the prices don't match up to the quality, nor quantity of the food. Usually one or the other justifies the higher price, unless it's the location, which wouldn't be the case here.  

Granted I was aware of the price of what I ordered, and sometimes it's worth paying more for getting more.  Not so much this time. 

Perhaps my expectations were too high.",-1
trn_3728,"National Margarita Day, so decided to go to CR and eat in the new location last night.  
Yes, Friday was National Margarita Day!

CR is still BYOB but if you want a Margarita, CR has all the mixers and will make your Margarita.  Just bring the alcohol.  Most tables and groups at the bar seemed to have either a bottle of wine or their favorite beer, as well as a few Margarita's.
  
Found out it was the first day for the New Expanded Menu!

There was a 30 minute wait for a table and not much room to wait.  Had fun talking with the others waiting for a table and a couple at the end of the bar. 

Service good!  New menu items were good!  Enjoyable larger restaurant!  Larger but still relatively small so you may have to wait or do take out.   Good food and a fun place to eat!",1

The entire staff is super friendly and patient (I haven't been the easiest patient to schedule or get in there) very first cleaning was thorough but not painful at all! Actually enjoyed going to the dentist for once. Would definitely recommend this to family and friends.,1
trn_3731,"This place is pretty good! First location is Arizona, and the daughter wanted to try it. Never knew there was one close to us in SoCal? I had the BBQ bacon burger with fries. Daughter and Wife had the cheeseburger. Place reminds me a lot of In-n-Out, the food is different though! My burger was very good, next time I will try the tri-tip sandwich. Wife and daughter enjoyed their burger also. We have had better, but we also have had worse! So do not get your expectation up so high, but I would come back again!",1

trn_3733,"I came to tailgaters tonight with my cousin after getting off at work. We had a server named steph, we ordered 20 wings and two 8 inch pizzas it came out pretty quickly. We paid for our bill in advanced because we wanted to catch a movie after so we're eating our food and our server doesn't come to check on us or do a 3minute bite check not to mention it's completely dead in here she had like 3 tables other than us and they already had their food. Not sure if it was because we are young looking and she just stereotyped us as not tipping her, which is funny cause we are servers ourselves at native grill and wings. We come here all the time so it was disappointing to see that just cause we paid for our bill in advanced that somehow meant we are not to be checked on or served anymore.",-1

We've been to Tom's several different times during a visit....9am, 2am, 5pm, 8pm....and every time it takes an extremely long time for any server to approach your table - even at 2am in the morning when you stop in for a late night snack and there are only 3 other tables with customers! the last 2 times, we walked out after seeing other tables sat before us not having service for at least the 20 minutes that we sat at our table with no greeting, server, etc....who happened to walk by our table several times. Unfortunately not going to be giving them another chance after 3 tries. too bad since the food isn't bad but only had opportunity to try twice...",-1
trn_3736,"Sometimes there's something so simple that causes you so much grief that it clouds your overall impression of a restaurant. Having a seat on a very small patio during the ""OpenTheSteet"" festival where Bloor was blocked off, on a beautiful day set the perfect stage for a great breakfast.

Receiving a so-so Healthy Fat breakfast with 2 poached eggs, 2 pieces of avocado,some salmon and old mushy tomatoes, took down the experience a notch and receiving your breakfast with 2 plastic containers of butter and one of honey sitting right on the food takes the review way down. I don't understand how restaurants think it is acceptable to place those plastic packets, (that have been handled through shipping and distribution and exposed to who knows what kind of bacteria) right on top of the food! Is it really too much trouble just to bring them on the side?

The meal itself wasn't great. The best part was the two slices of multi-grain toast. The poached eggs were so soft they looked like they glanced at some hot water. The smoked salmon was okay however the tomato slices, which I would have liked to have eaten with the salmon seemed to be garnish for the dish. Overall, at $14.95, this was not good experience.

Service was okay, albeit a bit ""clinical"". I walked inside to go to the bathroom and can't say I saw very many happy faces...you the kind faces saying, ""where's my meal"", ""I can't get any service"", and ""the food is not that great"". Just an observation on my part.

If you want to have a nice breakfast either on a great patio or even inside, L'Espresso Bar Mercurio just down the street is a much better place and the prices are nearly the same.",-1
trn_3737,"Nice hole-in-the wall dessert place. Good ice cream. The green-tea crepe ""cake"" was interesting!",1
trn_3738,"Stopped by for breakfast after a long night of boozing to grab a bite and keep the party going. Sat out on the patio area. They have plenty of fans and misters to keep you cool. Great area on strip for people watching. JoAnn our server was awesome. She made several recommendations and even questioned my manhood when I ordered a regular sized beer so I manned up and a red bull vodka to show her. Haha! I ordered a few more after too. She was super cool. I stopped by a week later but didn't run into her. 
The food is great. I ordered an egg white omelette and they brought me a regular one but they fixed it. Took a while but manager came by and told me my meal was on the house. Sweet! I still had to pay for drinks but I was like nothing beats free. I ordered a kale salad with it as well; just cutting carbs. I did share the house made pop tart which was off the hook. 
After a long fun day at the pool I brought my friends here for dinner. Sat on the patio on the strip. That was very entertaining bc of all the debauchery happening. It's Vegas so it's a normal Friday night. All of the food was delicious. 
Stopped by on my 3rd morning and ate at bar area. Laurie took care of me. She was awesome! She knows her golf courses in the area and gave me a bunch of recommendations for my golf trip the following week. Funny thing happened again when I ordered the egg white omelette. They brought me a regular one. They fixed it but I payed for it this time. It was 8am and some guy was doing shots at the bar. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and the food was great. Best part was the service. I stopped by again a week later to see Laurie but she was off. I had a great time golfing. Thanks, Laurie. P.S. Badlands was brutal.",1

trn_3740,Amazing. Brooke and Michael are very professional and helpful. They designed the most beautiful custom wedding invites for me. They incorporated all of the elements that I asked for and made any changes that I asked for promptly.

I can buy a head of lettuce for under $1. Why would I pay that much for iceberg? Absolutely ridiculous. So disappointed! What a waste of money! I saw the picture someone posted of the salad, and thought they were exaggerating; absolutely not! Don't waste your money",0

trn_3744,"I just LOVE this store, ever since it opened, I have been there very frequently.  It doesn't help that I live a block from the Don Mills location.  

Although most things are quite pricey,  they have very unique designers.  This is where you'll find different things, things that can't be found anywhere else.  Although the store doesn't compare to it's US counterparts (at least the ones I've visited), it's still a very nice and pretty store.  

The only thing that bothers me a bit is the Anthro card.  I use it to track my purchases for the returns if any.  Anytime I bring in something to return,  I give them the card so they can swipe and track it for the return.  They always ask if I have the receipt, since it's faster.  Well, what is the point of the card then?  That's why I don't bring/keep the receipt!

Otherwise,  I will forever be a fan of this store, so glad it came to Canada, and so close to where I live! Now i'm just waiting for J. Crew!!! *crosses fingers it'll be soon!*",1

trn_3748,"We live in Las Vegas but once a year we stay here to celebrate my husbands birthday with his friends who come from out of town. They guys LOVE that the Bass Pro Shop is connected to the hotel. The rooms are always clean and smell good  (no smoke smell from the casino). This year we had the Friday night BBQ Buffet which was good especially the bottomless beer! The shuttle is a good option because they are off the strip but if they are full you do have to wait till then next one comes so it can throw off your schedule for other things. On the down side the pool is only open till 10pm even on the weekends, which is early for people who like to hang out in the hot tub. It's reasonable price wise and has great options for gambling. I would recommend this place if you want a good place to stay off the strip!",1
trn_3749,"Do not come here if you are only ""a little hungry"". They make 7 egg omelets folks. The fruit salads are worthy enough to fit on Carmen Meranda's hat. The sugar dispenser have colored sugar. there is just the right amount of neon and fake trees. Most of the servers seem to be from the former eastern block countries and I am very happy that the wall came down. Hubba Hubba.
If you are over 21, I highly recommend the lounge. dimly lit. benches surrounded by fountains with gas fire in the middle of the water and classy swank cocktail waitresses, dressed in long black dresses, sits down next to you in to take your order.

I purposefully went looking for somewhere to go for my 21st, and I loved all the photos of the outside and inside of the Peppermill. When I got there, I was not disappointed by its looks. Sure, some may think its too ""vegas-y"" or tacky but I really enjoyed the uniqueness.

As for the food, the portions are large but finish-able, I had a pancake breakfast for dinner and my boyfriend had the fish and chips (curly fries) and we were both happy. I tried a mai tai and it was pretty big and delicious, though I can't compare it to other mai tai's as it was my first drink.

The staff were very helpful, and we even got a free souvenir photo!

I'm always nervous about x-rays and they also ease my worries.  They also have new hi-tech x-rays that are so quick and painless.  

The first person you'll meet is Liz, she runs the front office.  She is such a good example of what's to come.  Very friendly and welcoming and always professional.

I've always used insurance but I've sent a few people to him that don't have insurance and they've said it was affordable.  I happily refer friends to Dr. J. all the time and each and every one of them has thanked me.

trn_3755,"I'm going to give this place 5 stars.  While the food is not the absolute best Indian food that I've had, the price was excellent.  I had the special of the day, which was a chicken leg and thigh on a spicy, flavourful bed of rice.  With tax, the meal came to about $4.50. That's a pretty damn good price for a homecooked meal.  I'm definitely going back.  It gets 5 stars, because that same meal would have cost 10$ at most other Indian food restaurants.  The place was clean and ambiance and the atmosphere were really calm and relaxing.  I liked the music they were playing in the background.

A place is either 5 stars - 4 if it's good, but a little pricy, or 1 star if it's crap. There really is no middle ground when it comes to food or any product that you pay money for.  It's either good or it's not.",1
trn_3756,"Well Dr. Haymore did 2 root canals for me...one was fine the other i have had so many problems with. The root was not sealed so i have had pain for years (9 1/2). This root canal was 1 root canal, then a second one...and somehow 2 stitches were left in..that got so painful because i could not see them. Now i need to get the tip of another root done and finally sealed. I have spent years trying to figure out why my gum is always infected, and lost my back molar (behind this tooth)  I can say i am so far past frustrated...for this last one i am going to Urgent Dental.  On the upside neither root canal hurt at all. However years of pain made up for that.

Yes you did a root canal as well as the one through the top. No i did not go to a competitor, actually 4 dentists...and one(Dr. Tratos) traced the problem and did a film of it.  The tip of this root is still there and has been infected now since being done 9 years ago.  Yes there were 2 black stitches left in...because they got infected....no competitor ""from a FORD dealership"" sold me the idea....I have had to press the infection out of the top of my gum for 9 years,...I have the traced film that clearly shows this was not sealed...the material clearly passes from root to outside of gum... While i understand you want to soft pedal around...I am not here to go tit for tat....at this point i am just trying to save what is left of this molar.

trn_3758,"Decent food, but a horrible ordering system that outweighs the decent food.

We ordered a variety of menu items. My husband had a Chorizo Breakfast Burrito and that was his favorite item we tried. The burrito was large and would be plenty of food on its own. I ordered a Chicken Taco, a Carnitas Taco, Mexican Corn, and a Chorizo Mula. We also shared Chips & Guacamole. The chicken taco was decent, the carnitas didn't have enough flavor, and I loved the chorizo mula. The meats overall weren't as well flavored as other tacos I've had. The Mexican corn was not as good as I expected and didn't have a ton of flavor. The chips and guacamole were great. I liked all of the salsas I tried from the salsa bar.

My pet peeve is when a restaurant can make good food, but can't run a business. Taco Y Taco is the epitome of this. Listen to your customers and do something to improve your ordering system. I've heard people comment that other taco spots in town have the same ordering system. Guess what? Just because something has always been done a certain way isn't a legitimate reason to continue doing it poorly. 

Here's how the ordering could be improved. Offer paper order sheets where customers mark what and how many items they want. Customers then hand the order form at the start of the cafeteria line and meet their order at the register at the end. Let the staff sort the separate meat areas in the back, stop making it the customer's problem.

The inside of the restaurant was a mess. I didn't see the staff clean a single table the entire time we were dining. It was fend for yourself at the least dirty table you could find. Silverware, condiments, and napkins are located on top of the trash cans next to dirty trays and whatever else people leave on top of the trash can. This needs to be moved to its own sanitary location.

It took us four years to give this spot a second try and it'll probably be at least that long before we visit again.",-1
trn_3759,"Second visit way better than the first when they were closing as we were finishing in the grocery part of the store. Who'd have thunk it'd be like that?
Lovely bride got a Cali Burger on a free-gluten bun (bun should have been off to the side as requested) with just a wee smear of whack-a-mole under the tomatoe while I opted for the ""Southern Burger"" that arrived as advertised along with a forgettable draft. Aside from the bun thing the burgers were respectable at $5 and $6 (with a $5 beer a $2.50 chocolate bar lunch was exactly $20 which was sorta spooky) adequately toppinged and cooked through without burning, also moist but not dripping fat. Sides are generous and we wound up taking half of the tots and sweet taters home.
Burgers took much longer to prepare than we were told, and we probably could have gotten our shopping done instead of sitting watching the cook go through a dozen gloves making our lunch (yea for gloves!) Next time we'll do just that and get the food to go. Take-out is in reclaimed-paper paper boxes that should have some heat retention capacity.",0
trn_3760,"I had high hopes for this place, mainly because my mother, who I've taken to many great places in Chinatown, went to Sushi Samba and claimed it was the best meal she's ever had. So even though I knew it was expensive, if she said it was worth it I was believing her. 

First off, it was crazy loud in the place, and it was very hard for us (especially my grandfather) to hear anything that was going on. But it's a strip restaurant I get it. We ordered drinks, oysters, and the heirloom tomato salad. I didn't eat much of any of those dishes, but for dinner we each ordered a roll: the neo Tokyo, sasa hand roll, and I had the chef special which was tempura shrimp, tuna, and cheese on top. All of the rolls were pretty bland and my roll was especially chewy with the cheese on top. (I knew sushi wasn't supposed to have cheese yet it sounded intriguing.) 

For other small plates we ordered the hamachi Kama, tempura green beans, and scallops with Peruvian corn which everyone raves about. The best by far was the tempura. I have never had Peruvian corn but it was very big and sort of hard. The scallops didn't have any taste. 

My biggest complaint about the restaurant is that we felt that they were constantly trying to take our plates away and clear the table. I understand it's a tapas restaurant so food comes quickly but once all our dishes were there they kept asking to clear plates that still had food on them. Just felt like they wanted to crank out as many tables as they could that night. They did end up giving us complimentary ice cream pops which was nice, but I don't think I'll be going back. I don't go to strip restaurants often but this is why..",0

trn_3765,"A great local spot for burgers, fries, onion rings and other sandwiches. You can also pile on your own toppings yourself and they have a salad bar (if you're into that). My favorite is the teriyaki chicken sandwich that comes with a slice of pineapple for about $6. I get it on wheat with no cheese and load it up with onions and jalapeños myself (no extra charge). A good local healthy option. 

The gigantic burgers with multiple patties and cheese are also amazing in moderation. Everything is made to order. Staff are friendly. Cool place with good value.",1

My friend ordered the filet which was cooked to perfection.  The beet salad was fresh and flavorful. I had the Caesar Salad and Asparagus and both were clean,flavorful and beautifully presented.  The wine was perfect. Splurging on the 18 layer chocolate cake for dessert was a wise, if not decadent choice.  The general manager and the Chef stopped by our table and were warm and gracious.  The bread offerings were outrageously delicious!",1

Came here with a large Group of ppl on a sat Morning (12 of us ) 1 Noir Member 2 plat Members

We didnt came Together so the First Group was seated & we 2 Joined them. After 3 min our waiter came & Asked us to Pay 18% gratuity because we are more then 6 or 8? Don t know it any more. 
We told her that the First Group already Paied the 18%. 
She insisted & wanted us to Pay it now. 
So we told her over And over to Check it again. Then the supervisor came & told us the Same story again. 
Instead of checking the check Before asking us !!!!they let us Look like we Where lying. Come on that was so embarassing.

It really did worth my money and time. Trust me after you do your research you will see it is the highest rated buffet in Vegas.

Enjoy your stay and food.",1
trn_3772,"This is my husband's chosen place of worship, and with good reason.  The beer list is absolutely insane.  The waitstaff knows the beer list inside and out.  The food is pretty good.  The ambience is quite nice.

We came here after a lot of begging from my husband, and he absolutely loved it.  I, on the other hand, cringed somewhat at the price, but I suppose if you're going to drink Belgian beers handmade made by monks, where they only circulate a limited amount in the world and you literally have to go to the monastery daily..... well, it aint gunna come cheap.  Sorry people, no Coors light in this place.

The food was good, although they have limited vegetarian options.  The fries were great, mostly because they make their own ketchup there and it was quite tasty.  My husband also really enjoyed the chicken.

All in all, we'll be returning here every Sunday for drunken services.  Oh boy.",1
trn_3773,"We had some late dinner here post- Cirque on a Saturday night. 
We ordered a salad (I forgot what kind, but remember it was tasty) and the mushroom pizza. If you don't like mushrooms, which I don't, don't convince yourself that the mushroom pizza will have a little mushroom on it. Because it will come to you fully covered in mushrooms and you will not enjoy it. The crust was good, the pizza was generally oily. 
This place is just alright. The prices are good compared to what else you have around.",0
trn_3774,"This place rocks. I chose it as payment from a buddy at work whom I had picked up a couple of pounds of chorizo from Bill's Market over the weekend for.  Man am I glad that we went here. I had read the reviews on yelp and even reached out to my fb network.  Most of the pre-meal feedback I had received was positive and I was confident that I was going to get a good meal.  

I drove up there (the place is at Via Linda and 90th next to Teakwoods) after viewing the menu on-line and had already narrowed down my sandwich choices to a couple.  Walking up to the restaurant I noticed seating for about a dozen or so folks outside. Walking inside I was immediately hit by the aromas of warm bread, baked goods, and other goodness. 

After double checking the menu and seeing that the soup of the day was chili (sounded good but not enough to deter me from ordering a sandwich today), I was ready to order one of their signature  sandwiches, the Long Trail. However I will have to wait for another day to get properly introduced to a sandwich that is constructed by their own roasted beef with crumbled bacon on sourdough with peppered horse radish mayo, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, green pepper and dill pickles. Seriously if you are the owner and reading this, without even trying the sandwich I am now going to start lobbying for you to change the name to the Peter.  They were out of their roast beef. I am going to chalk it up to it being a Monday morning, they make their own and they are closed on Sundays, but there is still no excuse to not have Roast Beef readily available and alas this is why you have been deducted a star.  But enough about what wasn't there, let's talk about the masterpiece that I did order instead.

My second choice was the Italian stallion. A honey baked ham, hard salami and provolone cheese with lettuce, tomato, red onion, green pepper, pepperoncini and pickles tossed together in their balsamic vinaigrette on a sub roll slathered with mayo and mustard.  At the manager/owner's? suggestion I had them toast the sucker and got a bag of chips for $8.00.  

It took about 5-10 minutes for the sandwich to be made and I was out the door. While I waited the manager had offered up a complimentary chocolate chip cookie which was nice, although I don't think that it is standard operating procedure there.  The ambiance is cool and they play 70's rock. A full sandwich which is about a foot with a side (either potato, pasta salad, coleslaw, or chips) will run you 7.95 and a half sandwich with side runs you 5.75.  They also make fresh squeezed lemonade and serve Pepsi products. 

They do get additional kudos for having a punch card.  Every time you spend 6.00 you get a punch. On your seventh visit you get 6.00 off your meal. Not a bad deal. Doing the math, that makes this place a good, affordable, and delicious choice for lunch.  I should mention that my sandwich was great and perfectly toasted, you could taste all of the ingredients and they blended well together. I would definitely order it again, unless they have roast beef next time that is.",1

trn_3776,This location provides horrible service! I waited in the drive through for over six-seven minutes even though there was only one other car ahead of me.

trn_3780,"The guy who helped me (Gene) was the nicest, funniest, most helpful person I've ever met in the service industry. By the end of the battery service-- and I know that this sounds weird-- but he made  me feel like a friend. I also learned that their oil changes are almost 1/2 the cost of Jiffy Lube's changes. Between these 2 facts, they will get all of my future business!",1
trn_3781,"I would have rated this buffet as a 3.5 star if I could but since they got some self-serve drink machines I thought that was awesome.  The price isn't expensive compared to some other buffets.  Dinner menu was $30 a person which I was not complaining.  We only gave this one a shot because Ceasar's Palace buffet was packed and we were headed to LOVE Cirque at the Mirage so it was perfect.  

I've read that some people didn't like having a machine to serve your own drinks.  I found it had tons more selections than any other buffet and if you have a bad server, you won't be getting drink refills without waving them down.  Stop being lazy, it is a buffet and I think self serve drinks just make perfect sense too.  I've experienced at the Wicked Spoon that my server took forever to clear plates and refill drinks.

A little thing I noticed was that certain sections they don't refill or replenish the food very well.  For example the Asian food section had a lot of empty items and did not get filled up even by the time we finished eating.  Maybe they just thought no one would get any which does make sense.  Apparently a guest was disgusted that we grabbed the seaweed salad from the sushi area and asked what that was.  When she was told it was seaweed, she had a disgusted look in her face.  Right after she grabbed some sushi which has seaweed wrapped around the rice... Some people are just stupid. Sorry to be so blunt.

i will definitely give them another try just for their drink machine.",1
trn_3782,"Stayed here last weekend while in town for the Steelers game and was pleased with the room and helpful staff.

Nice size closet with ironing board and iron provided. Mini fridge and microwave were also on site.  Nice selection at the complimentary breakfast with plenty of helpings. Shopping within walking distance. Only con was the $16/day parking which may be on par for the area? Overall very pleased and would stay here again .",1

The service is good too. The waiter is friendly and cute! He gave me free small and cute desert and starter. ;-). You probably have to wait for a while to get your food.

My friends and I were there on Saturday September 3,  2016 and for the same drinks the price was  different every single time! First drink was 10$ then one hr later I was changed 8$ per drink and some of my friends paid 12 $ for the same drink..

After half an hour, our waitress offered us fries and apologized saying the food was ""taking longer than normal"". Once we got our burgers, we were underwhelmed. My burger was served on a cheap bun and my gal's patty was falling apart. We took our food to go and left. Maybe 10 minutes after we finished our food at home, my girlfriend was sick. Probably caught them on a bad day, but we probably won't be back.",-1

We put in a large takeout order tonight and of course, they gave us the wrong order and we didn't realize it until we got home. After driving back down, not even an apology, just general confusion and no discount to show for it.

There are better Chinese restaurants in the area and I suggest you try them first.",-1

There's not that many places to sit, people are usually camping here. If you need to charge your phone it'll probably hang off the walls and don't order an iced Oreo latte because it is very watery, or at least ask for milk instead. I like the feel of the place and they play jack Johnson which is very calming. Might not come back here for awhile.",0
trn_3790,"I'm about to revisit some of the Pittsburgh Strip District businesses I have bookmarked to review from my late-December trip to the city and figured there's no better place to start than The Strip itself.

One of my favorite places in the world, really.  So much culture, so much diversity, so much food!

Pittsburgh winter weather makes The Strip more enjoyable in the summertime than during winter months, but whatever.  That certainly doesn't mean that the area isn't bubbling with activity on the snowiest, windiest, coldest of days.  The hustle and bustle here rocks.

Parking can be tough, especially on Saturdays and Sundays.  I think Smallman Street is the best bet; even if parking areas are packed the wait usually isn't too long as people are constantly coming and going.  Just keep circling around, and keep an eye out for parking meters and spots marked ""TOW AWAY"" because they're not always so obvious.

Among my favorite businesses on The Strip--ones that I never miss when I'm in town--are Wholey's Market, The Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, Stamoolis Brothers, Reyna Foods, Art of Steel, and Lotus Foods.

Always looking forward to my next trip back to The Strip!",1
trn_3791,"Simply amazing.  I expected to really enjoy this show but didn't think I would love it nearly as much as I did.  The show begins with a bang as Cirque performers tossing each other down from the ceiling like yo-yo's to the tune of ""Get Back"" yet manages to top itself time and time again.

Don't worry about the show's ""plot.""  I'm hardly a dummy but half the time I could barely figure what was supposed to be going on.  Just let the beauty of the music, the dancing and the incredible set design take you away to a stranger, happier place.

As we were walking out of the theater, an elderly couple in front of us joked, ""They must have been on a LOT of drugs when they wrote that music!""  Thanks to them, I now have an excellent idea for what frame of mind to be in the next time I see ""Love.""",1
trn_3792,"Ugh, we really should have read the reviews before coming here.

We decided last Saturday night to ditch the Arcadia or Scottsdale dinner scene and drive up to Cave Creek for the evening. Thank goodness for the great weather and live band outside at Heralds that we could hear from our outdoor table. 

When we arrived, we asked if could sit outside (we saw seats available when we were walking in). The hostess went outside and then came back to let us know there were none available and we would have to sit inside, then walked away. Not wanting to sit inside (all I saw was an ugly red interior and a huge, empty restaurant), I asked the other hostess how long the wait would be. Luckily, she went outside and there were two tables for us to choose from! Thank goodness for her.

We asked for water right away, that came about 10 minutes later. They did have a nice beer selection, however, my beer was room temperature, hardly cold. When we ordered, I made sure they had bbq sauce as that's what I dip my hamburgers in (weird, i know) - she said that was no problem. So our meals came - apparently they ""discontinued"" carrying bbq sauce. My burger was just ok. My fries were good though! My boyfriend's steak was barely edible. He said his baked potato was the highlight of his meal.

Oh, and not that this matters, but we found grammar errors on the menu! And, the menu itself is quite basic in food offerings. Nothing unique at all.

I think this is the first one-star review I've ever given. However, it was sadly, a huge disappointment.",-1
trn_3793,"Tucked away in Mandalay Bay, the Border Grill is a wonderful option for good, tasty Mexican food and they offer several Vegan options. Love the guacamole and Cauliflower tacos. Seating is nice on the patio overlooking the Mandalay Bay pools. Good margaritas. Highly recommend!",1
trn_3794,"I don't even know where to start! Not only did my three year old loved his first visit but I didn't even want to leave because of the cool themed rooms they had in that office. One was like an aquarium and another was a Safari, I wish I could've peeked at all the rooms but they were occupied. Unfortunately my phone died so I was not able to capture any pictures of the awesome rooms....why yelp gods does this happen to me?!!! I must be prepared next time! 

We were welcomed by a front desk medical staff with a friendly face, Claudia, and led back by a dental assistant, Amanda. From start to finish I was so very pleased by their phenomenal service. Amanda is so good with kids and so is Dr. Galada. I was even able to video call my husband since it was my son's first visit and even though he was at work he got to be there virtually.

Claudia is the person with all the financial information for services and insurance coverage breakdown. I love being assisted by someone who is compassionate about their job. They are all compassionate people here.

My son was excited to get a special toothbrush from the dentist today but he got more than just that. There was a flat screen that pulled out in front of the dentist chair and my son was able to watch a movie (Madagascar) while he was having his teeth cleaned. They had a treasure chest for the children to pick out a prize after their visit. What a great experience for any child, especially it being their first visit. 

We cannot wait to go back in 6 months for another cleaning. If I didn't have any insurance at all I would still bring my son into this office. They are what they say they are, ""Affordable""! The breakdown cost for a service that my son's insurance will not cover yet is still affordable out-of-pocket. 

This is their only Kids' office that they have here in Las Vegas.  No matter how far I move one day, as long as it isn't in another state you can bet your bottom dollar I would still come here. 

Thank you 'Affordable Dental for Kids', you have made today's first visit so pleasant!",1
trn_3795,I got the three meat combo...it was good. One of the better ones in vegas. No attitude just good food. Tip if you want to know of its a good place to eat look around to see how many koreans are eating. If you see mostly non koreans it's a good clue that the restaurant isn't that good...,1
trn_3796,"YUM!!!! So this is basically a fast food window for crepes. Next door to the shop is a nice little place you can sit and eat your delicious crepes. We went for lunch and had a wonderful meal - and one that was honestly too much food for 2 people. We got 1 savory and 1 sweet crepe and we could barely finish the sweet one (though we did it was so good).

~ Caramelized Pear $10.25 caramelized pears, raisins, maple syrup, candied hazelnuts & chantilly cream. This was wonderful- sweet, warm, and the combination of soft pears and crunchy nuts was wonderful. One needs a tea or water to cut the sweetness after a while though. I think it would have been even better with peaches- which I seem to recall they used to have (I've been here before) but I'm not 100% sure on that.
~ Ham & Cheese $11.45 parisian ham, gruyere & béchamel sauce. WOWOWOWOW!! This was AMAZING! If you only have room for 1 crepe get this one. The meat  has a wonderfully smoky flavor and the gruyere is the perfect addition to the dish. The creamy and salty flavors mix well and leave you very full. 

For roughly $20 you can be stuffed and spend the rest of your time walking it off in either the casino or the strip!",1
trn_3797,"I love coming here, it's the perfect size, not too busy and well laid out

Prices are decent, great selection of mostly Mediterranean food, only their bread and prepared foods selection is a little weak.

Their fruits and veggies are well priced, which is a big plus for me.

trn_3798,"When I was walking in and saw a couple leaving and the man said ""we have to pick a better place next time"" I should have taken the hint.  I tried to order 2 different dishes and they told me they were out of the ingredients.  I then ordered the protein bowl which is supposed to contain chicken, quinoa, rice and veggies.  when it arrived at my table there were a few scoops of quinoa and a few mushrooms and the whole thing was literally drenched in balsamic vinegar. It was inedible.  I brought my plate up to the cashier and asked where the chicken and rice was and they said oh im sorry we are out. I also asked why they found it necessary to drown the quinoa with vinegar and they said oh thats how we serve it.  I politely asked for a refund and left.  I was not happy with how they handle their business and would never dine here again. I also overheard a woman in the restaurant commenting on the baked goods have absolutely no flavor.

This place not only had the phone in stock, but also the color rose gold, the highest GB, and my favorite case with screen protector! :) Dillon answered all of my questions while setting the phone up and set me up with the best plan to pay.

They take USPS & FedEx packages. They do not take UPS packages, but there is a UPS in the complex across the street.

The workers are very friendly! I usually just drop-off packages with the label already printed on for work, but they can provide everything you need to ship!

I delayed mailing my friend her baby shower gift (so delayed that she had the baby already) because I needed a box big enough to ship it in. I brought in my presents & it was a no more than a 5-minute process! They measured the size to determine what box it would fit it, weighed it, asked for sender & recipient address, what kind of shipping I would like, paid for it, got the tracking number & that was it! I didn't see them put it in the box, tape it up & etc., but my friend texted me a few days later saying she received it!

I highly recommend this place if you need help with shipping!",1

The nail tech took his time and the whole experience from the calf and foot massage to the moisturizing cream was wonderful.

When I walked in, there was no wait and at least two employees. Farida sat me down and looked at my face. I explained what I needed and she got to work. It hurt a little more than what I'm used to, but when I looked at the results, I was so happy! She fixed my problem and every hair was in the right spot. Overall, she was very welcoming and super nice. This is definitely my new spot. 

Bonus points: Even though I didn't have to wait, there was what looked like a super comfy leather couch near the entrance. They were also playing some really cool Arabic music :)",1
trn_3805,"I don't do a lot of reviews on here but felt compelled with Kangamoo. We waited with high expectations for this place to open and we were not disappointed. The premise was a lofty one but they have delivered. It's a place for parents to relax and enjoy themselves while the kids enjoy the 9500 SF play area. The one thing that everyone repeatedly says is ""I wish there was something like this when I was growing up."" 

I have three young girls (4, 3 and 2) and I was worried about letting them run around without me there to supervise. Kangamoo has the perfect number of staff positioned around the play area that after our first few minutes there it was clear they had it under control. We were there on opening weekend and a couple of times since and although they were crowded, it seemed to operate very smoothly. 

The wife and I now sit up at the front adult area and enjoy the massage chairs, coffee, and free Wi-Fi. I even brought my laptop today and got some work done while the kids played after school. 

The owners and staff are amazing. They all seem to be trained well on both customer service and child safety. I have seen them step in to help kids who seemed lost or even to brighten the day of a child that didn't look like he was having fun. 

The Kangaroo mascot is fun and a lot less scary as the big mouse at Chuck-e-Cheese. The girls love hugging Kangamoo and getting their picture with him. 

I love the fact that they have healthy snacks. You won't find candy, cookies or sugary drinks there but you will find some pretty awesome healthy snacks for the kiddos. My wife loves the Artesian foods they offer for the parents. Her favorite is the butternut squash soup. 

This is a great place to bring the kids to play and I recommend getting the punch card. It is a tremendous value. What I love the most is that the girls fall asleep so easily on nights when we visit. They really tire themselves out. :) 

So happy to have this option in our backyard and I highly recommend anyone who has not checked it out to stop by!",1
trn_3806,"Mr. Steers. Not the regular burger. Not the greasy, sloppy burger, not a burger made of chuck either, but made of steak. Makes for a different tasty burger served as a ball instead of a patty with crispy bacon and Susy-Q fries to die for AND they have black cherry cola. SOLD. 

This place has been around for decades and I've been going for over 20 years. Definitely worth the stop. Not cheap but for a different take on the usual burger, go for it.",1
trn_3807,"This is the second review that I'm writing for them, because the glazed donuts with cereal were so fresh and soft, and they were totally covered with cereal! They're great, and Hurt's is open 24/7...or as they say 25/8.

Pictured this time are the:
""Starry Night"" - a glazed donut with chocolate Icing and a bunch of Lucky Charms (I really like this one.)
""Turtle"" - a chocolate cake donut with chocolate icing and drizzled caramel with chopped peanuts (I didn't like this one; it was too dry.)
Fruit Loops on a vanilla glazed donut (LOVE this one) I was surprised, since I thought it would be basic, but it had such fresh fruity loops, haha, and a soft donut! Of course, they had just made this one!
Cap'n Crunch Oops All Berries cereal on a Vanilla frosting glazed donut (same, so fresh, so fruity) They had just made this one, as well.
Chocolate Cake with mint icing and diced pieces of Andes Mints - good if you like Andes Mints
""Birthday Cake"" - a chocolate cake donut with a nice amount of fresh chocolate cupcake frosting and confetti sprinkles (I liked this one, because the frosting made the chocolate cake donut less dry.)",1
trn_3808,"This review is both for their custom cakes and the delicious treats at the bake shoppe. 

Ordering our cake was a breeze, we gave them a concept for our wedding cake and they ran with it. I can't wait to see how it will turn out. The tasting was a very fun and personable experience. Yes you do pay for your samples however I believe it is  deducted from the total cost of your cake. We went with 3 flavors Red velvet with cream cheese icing, chocolate cake with cookies and cream icing, and banana cake with salted caramel icing. 

The Bake Shoppe, seriously how have we gone so long without a place like this in town. Sweet treats until midnight in a romantic/fun atmosphere and they serve wine, champagne not to forget their coffee/hot chocolate products. I believe it's Lavazza but I could be mistaken. Everything I have tried has been amazing! The chocolate mousse dome and birthday cake macaroon are my favorites at the moment. Paired with a glass of The Pessimist, seriously it's amazingggg.

The Girls at GSS know what they're doing, I wouldn't change a thing.",1
trn_3809,"Today my husband waited for 2.5 HOURS past his scheduled appointment time to find out that the staff had misplaced his file and no one even knew he was there for a procedure. At my request, once he was finally called back into the clinic, the CT technician was unaware of what area he needed scanned and either was not provided with his referring Drs notes or did not read/ obtain the file because she was clueless as to all important information that should have been reviewed and known before the scan was started. This made an already difficult day worse than we could have ever imagined. I worry about the validity of the CT results and am very disappointed in the SimonMed staff. They were at best unprofessional, unorganized, and unprepared to do the job that they claim to be able to do.",-1

When I ask for medium spice its medium spice, when I want it spicy it is actually spicy! The flavors are spot on, the service is excellent, I have no complaints! It's simply the best so far! Yum! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! I just went to a place rated 4.8 stars and I realized, after finishing my (so so) meal, I have been spoiled by dehli palace!",1
trn_3812,"I wanted to love this place, but it's rather overpriced. The service was the worst part of the meal, as the server halfheartedly took our order and showed no enthusiasm for any recommendations. The food was good, but not amazing. I am sorry to say I won't ever be back :(",-1
trn_3813,"LOVE THIS PLACE! can't go wrong with their hot dogs and I love the weekly hot dog specials.  The southern girl dog is probably my favorite and you can't go wrong with a side of tots.  Follow their instagram for their weekly specials (warning: it will make you hungry).  
They also have a great selection of beers, with good deals, and a rotating draught list! 

And don't forget to try their homemade pickles! I love the spicy ones.",1
trn_3814,"In response to the owner of this formerly wonderful restaurant, you sir have an interesting way of skirting the truth.  By virtue of the way you responded to my nephew ( Sean F. - 5/7/16), yes it was my birthday, you sound like a guilty man.  If it was the case that larger parties are usually concluded after 2.0 hours, don't you think it would have been helpful to let my husband know that information when we made the reservation?  As far as leaving the table to watch the derby, my husband DID tell the young lady when he made the reservation that watching the derby every year is one of our family traditions.  She told my husband that it wouldn't be a problem. It seems like both of those situations could be solved with a little better training.Oh yeah, I wonder who should be doing that? 

The final straw was your contemptible response to me when I asked if you cared that you were ruining my 60th birthday.  You said, "" I DON'T CARE, IT'S MY 70TH & I'M MAKING MONEY.""  So anyone in Yelpland looking to celebrate a special occasion with special people in your life, don't go to Hoffstots in Oakmont. This guy will kick your family out as he did ours. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, this owner wants more. That goes for you, all potential golf professionals & staff from the U.S Open---don't plan a leisurely meal at Hoffstots, the owner will kick you out & won't care how important the day was for you.",-1

trn_3816,I have to say a lot of the reviews are true as far as the wait but I love my doctor. Dr Alejandro Lopez is wonderful. I have been going here for almost 2 years and despite the inconvenience of the wait I stay. Dr Lopez is caring and spends the time it takes to help me. Everyone at the front desk and elsewhere has always been kind and caring. I believe they do the best they can and try to help as many as they can. It is not always possible to have an appointment when you need medical care.,1
trn_3817,"The Sunday brunch and dance event here is excellent!

For just $18 you get to enjoy an all you can eat brunch buffet and a salsa dance lesson.

The buffet isn't standard brunch food (omelettes, sandwiches, etc) there are lots of great options to choose from! Todays selection included an egg bake, curry chicken, rice & beans, and salad. They also served the most amazing hashbrowns. 

After brunch you get to enjoy a salsa lesson accompanied by a live band, loads of fun!

Especially great for birthday parties.",1
trn_3818,Used to go here frequently and the food was excellent....sad to report that they've gone down hill. Was in the area and went there....my friend ordered the teriyaki chicken which he reported as flavorless....and made him sick in addition!! I ordered a Las Vegas Roll.....VERY disappointed! Poor flavor & extremely small to what they used to be. Needless to say.....will never go back!!!!,-1
trn_3819,"I was just here last week with two of my friends to watch the world cup game and it was a terrible experience.  Unfortunately I had been here before and had a decent experience - hence me coming back - but this was a terrible experience.  We sat down at the bar outside and were greeted by our server and got our drinks started. So far, so good.  We all open a tab, even though the card was returned to us (never seen a system like that) and our drinks arrive.  First bad experience is that we were given small plastic cups for our beer, but when an older group sat down next to us and place their beer order they received glass cups.  Their order did not specify a different drink size, so I do not know why they got preferential treatment as our beer warmed up much faster.  Moving on.  

We are shortly asked later if we want to order food, which we did, but had not made a decision so our waiter/bartender told us he would be back in a minute.  We never saw him again.  Another man came to the bar, seemingly in place of our waiter/bartender, but he does not say a word to us and looks away even as we tried to get his attention!  Over half an hour goes by and we realize they have no intention to serve us.  Because we took 5 minutes to look the menu over?  no clue.  So we grab the attention of one of the staff and tell him that we are done and would like the check, which he pretends like he doesn't hear us and laughs with the other bartender outside and then heads off to get the check.  Again, we never saw our original waiter/bartender and had no heads up as to who would serve us.  As we are paying our bills, we are asked how our drinks and service were, and as my friend is replying the server/manager/whatever just turns away and does not even acknowledge the feedback.

We all paid our bills, including no tip for the abhorrent service.  I wish I could recommend this restaurant as I live 5 minutes away and would love to come here for food and drinks with friends, but I will never come back.  One of the worst services I have received as I did not feel like a customer, rather someone loitering and causing them a hassle.  Im not even that hard to impress, but they have gone out of their way to make this a poor experience for me and my two friends - which now we all will not recommend or, heaven forbid, dine at this restaurant again.  1 star out of five, this is generous.",-1
trn_3820,"This is a first class venue for events like weddings etc.
Very professional staff, good food and the ambiance here is great. 
You also pay first class unfortunately but for a once in a lifetime event, just do it!
Parking is nearby but unfortunately not free.",1
trn_3821,"This was the first of the ""casual"" fun dining places I remember going to growing up. As a matter of fact I had three first dates here, and my first legal drink.

Everyone in my family who would go to Ground Round on Sunday afternoon could not get over the fact that there were free peanuts and that you disposed of the shells by throwing them on the floor, except for my clean freak mother who put her shells in a paper napkin then politely handed them to the waitress.

Chicken fingers: this was the first place that I can recall that had chicken fingers on the menu, and for some reason we were infatuated with them. Ground Round's as I recall were very tasty, crunchy, delicious and served with bar b que  sauce. We were also in disbelief that Ground Round offered FREE refills on soft drinks, OMG free refills? WOW! This was how the rich people dined.... Lol.

When my older cousin got married he even had his bachelor party here as well as the rehearsal dinner, damn we were in love with Ground Round. 

Age catches up with us, and taste buds mature, and arteries clog and places like the Ground Round start to become faded memories. Someday when I pass a ground round in my travels I will stop in, throw a peanut shell or two on the floor and toast the three girls i happily dined here with and remember the departed family members that I spent hours with here on Sunday afternoons.",-1
trn_3822,"I love this place. The food is amazing and the service is wonderful. I've been here on dates and girls nights out and I always have a great experience. The crab cakes, filet, and half chicken are my favorites. 

The outside patio is so cute when the weather is nice. I would never have guessed that such a good restaurant is tucked away in an office building. If you haven't been here you should definitely check it out.",1
trn_3823,"Hot Garlic Eggplant- not super spicy, but, oh sooo delicious! If you've haven't tried sweet'n'sour eggplant, eggplant w/ fish sauce, or really any eggplant dish from an authentic Chinese restaurant, do yourself a favor and try it!

Pork with Dried Bean Curd- this had plenty of spice, and was very good.

Both dishes came w/ small rices. Delivery was quick (30min). Food was hot, ample, and the closest thing to the best Szechuan Chinese food I've had at Seattle's Sichuanese Cuisine (recommended by a friend from Szechuan province), and St. Paul's Little Szechuan.

Please order off the ""Traditional"" menu, as Madison has far too many average American Chinese restaurants (I'm looking at you Imperial Garden), and could use a little ""authentic"" competition.",1
trn_3824,"Very cool atmosphere. A lot of healthy choices.  Had the Adobe Chile Chicken bowl  which is fantastic. Had the chicken soup as an appetizer and it tasted great, but all of the cheese melted and was at the bottom of the soup. It is a very casual atmosphere. The food comes out quickly.  Did not have dessert but they have soft serve coconut ice cream. Thy have a choices of sauces for the tacos and bowls that tasted good.  Service was good and quick. Thy have private parking right in front of the restaurant. They have a huge outdoor patio with heaters.",1
trn_3825,"I went here as a group of 6 friends and our waiter, Sonia, was great and very quick to understand how we paired up to split our meals/receipts. I tried poutine here for the first time- Poutine BOM, and my friends ordered Poutine Dynamite, which was a bit more spicier with jalapeños. Both were good! Add a little ketchup on top and it was perfect. The poutine portions were also large enough to split between 2 people.",1
trn_3826,"I came into this restaurant to use a gift card and the I am so glad I didn't have to pay. I was appalled by the soggy shrimp, tasteless fish, greasy baked potato and the slop on my girlfriend's plate was atrocious. Everything from the flavor to the appearance was just a jumbled mess of ersatz food. The biscuits may be the only redeeming quality (kind of like the fries at McDonald's), however they are hardly compelling enough to return.",-1
trn_3827,"For the longest time I've been wanting to buy the Urban Decay 'Heat Pallet' and was finally able to. So after calling multiple stores and getting the sold out answer I decided to call one last store which was Silverado. The girl who answered the phone (didn't say a name) told me they were available and they do holds so I was ecstatic to hear that. I literally drove across town to this location to walk in and rudely be told by this girl with dark long hair and tons of makeup that they haven't had this pallet for weeks now. Now instead of apologizing and trying to fix the problem she just gave me an attitude and cut me off acting like I was lying about calling (had their store number with the time still on my call log). By this point I was beyond pissed because she continued her business and ignored me. So I left and ended up just calling the store again asking to speak to a manager. The lady was apologetic and told me she would check the cameras to see who answered the phone for when I called the very first time since none of her happy go lucky employees would fess up. Anyways she found out and said when they get a shipment in they would call me and give me 20% off. Shipments come on Monday which happened to be the next day.. its Monday and already 1:30PM never received any call so finally I called and them a different manager answered and I had to go through this bullsh*t again because apparently no one at this location knows how to communicate. After figuring out if what I'm saying is true or not (15 mins later) she tells me it's on hold and to come whenever I'm ready. Once again I drive across town to get the same rude girl as the first time. I say I have a Heat Pallet on hold and she grabs it then checks me out and says the total is $58 and I let her know I have a 20% off discount and once again her rude condensing attitude is back and she tells me ""Um we don't give discounts on Heat Pallets"" and I explained why I was getting one so then she radios the manager and says ""The girl who claims someone said we had a Heat Pallet is here."" FINALLY they confirm it and I get my discount, pay and get the f out of there. The reviews of horrible customer service for this store are TRUE!",-1

trn_3829,"This place is starting to get too mainstream for their own good. The quality of food here is nowhere near the one at Planet Hollywood. This one is literally like a sandwich place you would find in any mall food court only way more expensive. The Italian sandwich we ordered was super overly salty, the chicken noodle soup had 4 noodles and 3 tiny pieces of canned chicken, and the tuna melt was decent but nothing spectacular. All that and a drink came out to $30 and that's with a players card discount. A medium sized fountain soda here is almost $5!!! This ain't the movie theater for godsakes. The Planet Hollywood Earl's used to be a true sandwich gem, haven't been in awhile but this Earl's at Caesar's is seriously nothing more than an overpriced Quizno's.",-1

I ordered a special (biscuits and gravy, bacon, fried chicken, and an egg). I loved everything. I also tasted my sister's Mac n cheese, and it was delicious! I was on my bachelorette attire and the manager COMPED MY MEAL as a congratulations. Loved it, will definitely return.

trn_3833,"I will just give facts and you can determine. On Jul 14 I brought in my Galaxy Note 5 that I dropped and the screen was slightly cracked, but the screen was not working. I was told it would cost me $284.00 to fix, with 1/2 down for payment. (I was also told that they would have to fix the back screen because it was also cracked for an additional $75.00, but would give me 50% off of the $75.00, $284 plus tax was total). Later on Jul 15, they called and said my phone was ready (good service, $310 repair), and when I picked it up that day, the speaker microphone was not working. Luckily I had not driven home before I tested it. I sat for an hour for Brian to determine that the microphone part was missing and must have dropped out when he was repairing the phone. They would have to order a replacement part since he couldn't find it, and it would take 2-3 business days to get which would be Tuesday or Wed. Brian said they would call me when the part arrived. Also, my stylus was not in its space, and had been left in the repair area. I did not drive back to the store and said i would pick it up when I came in the following week.  I did not hear from anyone by Wednesday, so on Thursday (jul 21) I called and talked to Raymond who stated he did not know anything about the ordered part. Brian called me back apologizing that he had not told his manager about ordering the part. He states the part was ordered, but had not come in yet. (why didn't someone call me to advise me?) They ""hoped"" the part would be in sometime on July 25 or 26. Raymond and Brian called on July 25 to say the part arrived and to come in and give them 30 min to 1 hour for them to replace the part. It took about 30 minutes after I arrived (thank you). Raymond stated they had a hard time finding the part and had to eat some of the cost... They apologized again, which I appreciate but it could have been avoided.",-1

trn_3839,"North Hills Grill is unfortunately in a location where several businesses have tried and failed.  This is the first time I've actually had a chance to try one of these businesses before it was no more.  I hope North Hills Grill, a friendly family-run business, finally breaks the streak.

Why? Several reasons. Most importantly, it's on my way in to work so I can pick up dinner on my way in before an overnight shift.  I can also currently use my Just Pay Half Hot Card (https://www.justpayhalfpittsburgh.com/index.php?positionID=2927). But even better, the food is great.  I've tried the Chicken Caesar Wrap, the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  Each sandwich comes with a side and I've tried the Chicken Dumpling Soup, Fries and Fruit Salad.  Everything tastes fresh and homemade and I haven't been disappointed by anything (though the fries had a bit too much seasoning for my taste and burger was a bit messy).  Oh, did I mention they also make fresh fruit smoothies?  I've only tried the Mango but they offer a wide variety of flavors.  

I hope North Hills Grill is here to stay because I plan on returning as often as I can to try a few more of the sandwiches, sides, salads and smoothie flavors.  Stop in if you're nearby because I don't want them to go away!",1
trn_3840,"So I was very skeptical about coming to this dentist. I searched the reviews after I booked the appointments for my children, so I didn't want to cancel. 
We had a mid-morning appointment and were the only people in the waiting room. The treatment area is only blocked by a glass/water wall so you can see the kids in the back, which I liked. There was a family back in treatment and as soon as they were done we were brought back. Mind you this was my first trip here and they got me back very quickly, I did send my paperwork over ahead of time so maybe that helped.
Anyways I took my 5 year old back first, while my 2 year old still got to play in the waiting room since I could see him (big + in my book) and the whole staff was very upbeat. My daughter had a took knocked out and then pulled when she was three so she is very iffy about the dentist in general, but the whole staff was patient with her. She even took xrays (which she had always thrown a fit about). Dr. Cotton showed me on the xray that her bottom tooth would be coming in before she lost her baby one and sometimes she recommended getting the baby tooth pulled but based off my daughters history she does not think it would be wise (yay for not being money greedy!). My two year old sat in my lap while they did his exam, the whole staff was back chatting with me the whole time. I actually felt very comfortable. Had I not read the reviews I would have never guessed that they were rated so low. We will be going back for their next check up!",1

Prices are good for what you get so a thumbs up for value and the free wine is a win and nice bonus.  Kids options are good here and I was a fan of their main dishes, ordered spaghetti with Cacciatore sauce (a little spicy), wife got the pomodoro, kid got the spaghetti with meatballs. The add ons were wonderful. The garlic bread was great, the minestrone was solid, and salad was fantastic as well. Their salad dressing is tasty and we'll balanced.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The cappuccino was a nice touch and ending to a very delicious and wonderful experience overall.

Parking was easy enough, and their staff was great and kind. Right next to The High Roller which is also a highly recommended attraction in Vegas.

So this place is nice, clean, not very big and not crowded at all. What stood out was their customer service: the employees  were great, specially  the gentleman  that checked us in at 12:30. After I jumped  for a few minutes  I noticed  my bad knee started to  hurt  (not their fault) so I asked him if I could  pass  my entrance to  my husband who wasn't  jumping  and he said of course  and even offered to  give my husband  a bigger  pair of socks.  I only give 4 stars because  my little  one did not enjoy and she got stepped  on at the trampolines  a couple times. She spent more time crying  than enjoying so I don't  think  this is a good or safe option  for toddlers  but the  older  girls had fun.

trn_3850,"The convenient part of Taco Y Taco is that they're open late night especially around the location that it is in where there are barely eating spots available. So it's nice to not travel as far as the strip or China town to get food. There are 4 stations for different items but during late nights there's only one person running the three Taco stations. The 4th station, next to the register is where you'd let the person know you'd want things like a burrito or carne asada fries for example. Then you'd pay at the register and sit and wait for your food to come out once it's ready. I got four tacos, a breakfast burrito, and carne asada fries for $25.09 w/ tax. We waited about ten minutes for our carne asada fries and breakfast burrito. While we waited we packed some sauces from their condiment bar where you could pack limes, mild sauce, habanero sauce, etc. Customer service was great, I really liked how patient the cashier was with us with it being our first time but the only issue was the guy at the 4th station was cleaning AND serving food with the same gloves on. You could see him taking a cleaning rag and wiping down spilt food, taking dirty dishes back and forth to the dishwashing station, and then coming back to his station rolling up a burrito with the same gloves, no changing it or washing it. So I'm not sure if I ever want to come back just because of that, they were slow anyways so he had the opportunity to wash his hands and change his gloves after cleaning. Aside from that the food was awesome! It's a bittersweet feeling for me, I love the taste of their food but thinking of how it's prepared with the same cleaning gloves worries me.

Personable, caring....  she takes the time to spend with her patients to make sure all of your questions are answered AND you understand what she has told you.  One time I did have to wait for a bit in the exam room.  I was kind of getting huffy (I hate to wait and that's so NOT like this office)  She came in very apologetic and explained an emergency came in and she had to spend the time - she explained, something she would also do with me - and all of her patients.....   can't really fault that! She also is the first doctor of the 3 I have gone to who has been able to diagnose my symptoms and she sent me to a specialist. An added benefit is having the lab ""in house"".

trn_3856,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of Sushi Ken's raw fish.

My husband and I judge whether we will re-visit a Japanese restaurant by the quality of its sashimi. Sashimi is usually the first thing we order in a Japanese restaurant, and sadly, it also often ends up being the last thing we had in most Japanese restaurants. Although sometimes we have to put up with skimpy pieces, rough uneven cuts, and fishy aftertaste, the husband and I are in our unwavering quest for the sashimi we want to come back for.

Then we found Sushi Ken, with its beautiful, thick-cut sashimi, thawed to a soft, buttery texture, and no fishy taste. Plus, reasonable price too. 

Because I have a soft spot for ramen noodles, I also ordered the combo of Tonkatsu noodle and beef curry for $11. The ramen is okey, probably not good enough for people from NYC or CA who are pampered by good Japanese restaurants. To me, it is satisfying because it is comfort food. I am forgiving as long as I can have one when I need one. 

The beef curry is quite generous in portion given it's like 3 bucks extra in addition to the ramen if you get them in combo. Again, it is not outstanding, but good enough for me.

I think service was great during the time we were there. Most servers were Japanese and were very friendly. The menu has a large selection of food. To us, they did one thing, and the most important thing right--sashimi. We will be back, soon.",1
trn_3857,"This was a terrible experience. We have been here a handful of times before, and always had something incorrect or service issues. This was ridiculous. First, the service and the food was awful. Our server clearly didn't care and she was training a new employee! Prices are high for the quantity and quality served, such as $16.95 for 3 Taco Bell size tacos that are underseasoned and underwhelming. In contrast, the fish bites were so salty, they were almost inedible. They brought me the wrong salad. I didn't realize it until the guy walked away. I thought I would try it, but the strawberry dressing they brought was disgusting. I waited almost 18 minutes before our server came to the table. I told her the salad was wrong and the dressing was awful. She said it was wrong and would have them make another one. I told her I did not want to wait and everyone else was well into their meals. She said OK and left. Someone brought me different dressing, but I did NOT like that salad. When she brought the check, we were still charged for the $16.95 salad that she even pointed out I didn't eat. I am SO SICK of having to beg for a manager when there is an issue that the server is CLEARLY aware of. This time, we paid the bill and left. We will write reviews and tell everyone we know about our rotten experiences at this restaurant instead.",-1
trn_3858,"I went in to buy cleats for my road pedals and placed an order for two pairs since they were not in stock. 10 days later, I hadn't gotten a call from the store saying my cleats were in, so I called to ask for an update. The person on the phone couldn't help me and said the owner would have to call me back. I never heard from anybody and that was over a week ago. Glad I didn't take them up on their suggestion that I pay at the time of placing my order. I'm happy to support local bike shops, but not one that can't handle basic customer service and order fulfillment. I went to Cyclologic instead and got my cleats immediately.",-1

trn_3861,"My story sums up my review. Me and four other friends decided to go here for a quick bite and drink. The restaurant was busy. We were seated quickly (outside, on the balcony), which started out as a good sign. However, after our waiter initially took our orders (well, the drinks at least) he took another table's order around us on the balcony and gave them their drinks first. Okay, mistake. We got ours soon after, placed our oder for food, and that came relatively quick (but not from our waiter). We waited outside for over 25 minutes wondering if our waiter was going to come back. He was cleaning tables around us, attending the other guests, but not once came back to us (we signalled and called). Not only are we dying from the heat, but we were finished and ready for the bill. I had to go inside, finder someone who looked in charge (there was nobody, not even at the greeting desk) until finally I got someone to send our waiter back. Once he came, we asked for the bill. Another 17 minutes passed by, and we hadn't seen him once (the other guests at this point went inside because they were too hot). Finally, we all got up, walked back in the restaurant, and a few minutes later he gave us the bills and took off. Probably the worst service of a restaurant in that mall.

Summary: Food was okay, nothing that sets it apart from the competition. The price is also much on the higher side for okay quality sushi. Not my go-to place, although recreational design was nice (also pre-booking and ordering food with the tablets is nice). Service was just plain horrible (read the story above for more on that). Remember (for some weird reason) they DON'T accept debit.",-1
trn_3862,"We had American Plumbing replace our front spigot and replace the valve that feeds our pool leveler in back.

They called before they came, they showed up on time, and we're very professional and personable. Also, importantly, they charged us what they quoted us over the phone, even though they had to do a little bit extra work to make it all right. We are located in Gilbert and I would definitely use these guys again. Thank you American Plumbing.",1
trn_3863,"Vendredi 26 septembre 2014

Par un superbe vendredi ensoleillé, les pas décidés, on se dirige vers le Centre de Commerce Mondial. On décide d'essayer un endroit fraîchement ouvert, Quattro Piatti, petite place de sandwich, en apparence très design, avec une allure invitante.

Le concept est simple, on choisit le type de sandwich puis le plat principal qui y sera ajouté puis les accompagnements (légumes, sauce, etc...) qui garniront le sandwich ou le plat.

Toutefois, un gros bémol, on vous suggère, par exemple, un sandwich La Piadina, malheureusement ce n'en est pas du tout ! On considère le client pour un niais. C'est un vulgaire wrap ! La Piadina est un sandwich fait comme une crêpe pliée en deux et grillée (obligatoire) originaire d'une région d'Italie, l'Émilie-Romagne. Il en a été question à l'émission l'Épicerie, à Radio-Canada. Ce N'EST PAS un wrap ! On exploite ici l'idée crée par un restaurant américain présenté à Diners-Drive-ins-and-Dives sur le Food Network. En bout de ligne, l'amalgame de saveurs est bien ordinaire et ça ressemble à n'importe quelle sandwicherie ou kiosque de bouffe sur le pouce, tout simplement.

Friday septembre 26th 2014

On a sunny and warm-hot friday, feet on-the-go, I walk out toward the Centre de Commerce Mondial. Decided to try a fresh new place Quattro Piatti, small sandwich stand in an alluring design.

Simple concept, you pick your format of meal, then your inside and then the garnish (vegetables and sauces).

Althought seems to be very stylish, ... if you pick the Piadina, .... it's NOT ! The Piadina IS NOT a wrap ! The Piadina is a crepe served grilled and folded in half. Its origins are in Italy, from the Emilie-Romagne region. That particular folded crepe-sandwich was also featured on the popular public affairs show l'Épicerie on Radio-Canada network. They are simply exploiting an idea originally created in an american restaurant featured on the popular show Diners-Drive-ins-and-Dives on the Food Network. They take the client for a ride. End of the line is....the flavor mixt is not original, it's not a new concept, it looks like a very ordinary sandwich and fast meal place on-the-go.",-1
trn_3864,"If you don't care to bother with clients who only want to get into the club to party then why do you offer the service?
My friends and I were left high and dry outside of Pure on Halloween night when our ""host"" left because we arrived late and never came back.
We were a little sketched out when we were told to meet with Jeff to give him the money outside of the restaurant where he was eating dinner, without receipt or contract handy. He assured us that he wouldn't bother to scam us over ""only $280."" Sorry that we're not high rollers and VIP table guests but $280 is a lot for us to hand over someone without really being sure of how their company works.

Despite being sketched out, we went along with it because the company was recommended in a guide book I had purchased. The first night went relatively smoothly. We arrived later than our estimated time, but our host Jeff Berg met us and took us into the club without a hitch. The second night, we were again arriving late since we were 4 girls getting ready in one room and visitors who were totally unaware of just how long it takes to go less than a mile down the strip. Our host, Ron Berg (Jeff's brother), was supposed to meet us up around 11:30 but again, we were running late as we were all trying to dress up in costume for Halloween.  When we got there, he had left to go to another venue but said he was on his way back to meet us. An hour passed with no word from him. He responded to neither text nor phone call.
When I texted Jeff (a different Jeff than Jeff Berg), he told us to go to the bouncer and request a certain individual who let us in without question. If that's possible, then why is a host even necessary, and why did they not just tell us to do that instead of having us wait over an hour outside the club?
We were told we'd get a refund for that night. We'll see if he sticks to his word.
My advice, if you're not getting table service and all the hoopla, don't bother with Red Carpet VIP bc they clearly aren't concerned with deals in the measly hundreds. Apparently their heads have gotten too big after being featured on Travel Channel and MSN Travel and the Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas to care about the people that they started their business for.",-1
trn_3865,"My husband and I visited the MGM Grand buffet on Sun evening 8/2. We used a two for one with M Life. I believe it would have been worth full price.
We found the Salad bar to be set up well with only 2 selections deep so you could reach the back easily. One  of the items was green pea shoots which were a nice treat.
There was a nice selection of chilled shrimp,  cold crab legs and steamed crab legs. The crab legs were split open for easier access .The carving station had roasted turkey, kielbasa and prime rib. The prime rib was delicious although cooked too much for my husband's taste. 
A notable dessert was the peanut butter gelato which tasted like butterfinger candy bars.there was also delicious bread pudding with vanilla sauce you add yourself.

trn_3868,"Fantastic food, great service, terrific company and a wonderful cause!
6 of us got together at Taste tonight for the Yelp Eats of Hunger Relief event. (Nov 4 -10)
There is not much fanfare on the outside to let you know you are AT Taste but let me tell you, people KNOW where this place is! It was packed by the time we left at 930pm, not a seat left in the place.
It is dim, small in size and very intimate. There is a shared washroom that is kept immaculate.
The space itself is modern, not too loud with a great vibe going on from the people, the kitchen. You can see everything that goes on, the kitchen is small and does not have everything a typical kitchen has, but they make it work. Shawn, you worked some magic tonight!
Taste is my kind of place - they serve tapas, small plates of food for sharing. Man, what didn't I try? The Mac and Cheese was to die for (thanks Maria!) We ordered the prawn tacos, perogies, chicken masala drumsticks and the meatballs. O M G. All were incredible. Wendy let me try her cheesecake in a mason jar. Geez, I need to start letting go a bit and order dessert now and then.
No beer on tap for Manuel but he found a Dead Frog (yes, you heard it here!) beer that he liked as well as a blonde, both bottled. I had a couple of Rieslings and a strawberry champagne concoction wine.
Bill our server was busy as heck with all his tables but he took great care of us and had a nice sense of humour.
Our conversation flowed at the table and I love nothing more than to nosh with other foodies who truly enjoy trying new things.
Thanks to Shawn who gave us a wee one bite dessert as we were finishing up.
I was impressed with the prices not to mention how we snagged parking right out front on the street.
Chalking this up to a great evening. We helped feed some of Calgary's hungry as our receipt of over $30 prompts Taste to donate $10 to the less fortunate.
As always, thanks Wendy for all you do, you were on your game tonight and we loved this venue.
I am starting to get sappy and crazy complimentary so I better just shut up and go to bed!
Thanks Taste!",1

They're always really fast at getting your order ready. The parking can be tricky during busy hours such as lunch and dinner since it's surrounded by other frequently visited businesses. The food isn't anything to write home about but not bad either. The menu is pretty generic. Again, I recommend this place for a quick Chinese meal if you're not into Panda Express.",-1

Nice ambience.  But the food was the highlight for us. Chicken was nicely battered, really crispy and not overcooked at all.  We had the half and half special and it was way more than we could finish. Lots of food but each piece of chicken was so delightful. Just to warn everyone though, spicy is pretty spicy so just be careful. It's a sweet and spicy sauce that creeps up on you after. We also tried the butter cheese corn and it complimented all that spice. Overall we were all happy with the service and would definitely come back.",1

trn_3876,"Thank you to EVERYONE who recommended this to us.  Sooooooo good!  The BEST steak in Charlotte, for sure!

We started with the shrimp scampi, which did not disappoint.  Let me rewind to the wine selection...great selection of wine and we happened to go on half priced wine night.  the cheese and crackers are decent.  Taste but move on.  You seriously want to save your appetite for the steak, wine ,and dessert.  

The salad was just okay for me but the dressing was fantastic.  Homemade and so yummy.  Husband got the French onion soup and I got a little starter jealous.  Definitely, go with the French Onion Soup!  It was not too salty, the croutons and cheese were perfection.  

I got the loaded potatoes and he got loaded mashed potatoes.  I thought the potato was a waste, because all I wanted was to finish the steak.  I ate it.  Hubs devoured his mashed potatoes.  

He got the filet with red wine butter.  I got the filet with the blue cheese crumbles.  Medium rare, is where it is at.  Best temp for this steak and perfectly cooked!  We both loved our choices.  

We got the SuperTusxcan wine...perfect with the steak.  

We had a bit of an overly cursing neighbor.  They quickly put an end to his evening, in the most subtle way.  No drama in this establishment 

Such a great meal and great recommendation from the best yelpers!  Thank you!",1
trn_3877,"With its flashy neon on the outside and its pink neon on the inside, this place oozes cheese, old timer vibes, and memories of Vegas yesteryears.  Amazingly, I did not see the ghost of Liberace which I kept looking for in the corner of the room.  How I managed to avoid this landmark for my seven years in this town is beyond me.

This review is for the Fireside Lounge only.

The bar was surprisingly busy, filled with a loud bachelorette party, couples lost in each other's eyes, and....a prostitute?  Definitely an interesting crowd.  It's more of a date spot, so if you are looking to meet people (other than prostitutes) you may want to think twice before coming here.

The bartender looked irritated and wasn't friendly and I don't understand the long gowns they make the poor cocktail waitresses wear.  Drinks are a little overpriced considering this really isn't a part of the Strip where tourists hang out.  A beer and a vodka cranberry cost $13.

I have to mention that the floor was FILTHY.  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in about two weeks.  Bleh.

The Fireside Lounge is a place that is trying to cling to its '70's heyday and I like it.  Vegas needs more old-school.  Now if only they can clean the floor and liven up the bartenders then I could see myself stopping by more often.",0

My friend and i came in to get a coffee before we were about to go get our nails done next door. So happy to have stopped in here! The two people behind the counter were so sweet and very happy to suggest their most popular drinks! We had a lot of questions and they answered everything with a smile! That's service! We ordered an iced white choco mocha and a SWEETBOX coffee. They were presented on wooden coaster with a gold spoon and a palm. Such a pretty display! The white choco mocha was a very sweet and yummy drink! The SWEETBOX coffee is very cute and less sweeter because it's essentially an Americano with foamy whip on top. You can stir to get the flavor but they suggest drinking the whip and then taking a drink! Either way it was good! The ambience in here is great it's so cute and exactly what you imagine a coffee shop being like!,1

Great tequila special on Thursdays, which you can also order a margarita with at a discounted price. Had to have a Guinness while I was here too. Of course. 

Started with the spinach dip (half off thanks to Yelp!). Honestly one of the best spinach dips I have had. Next time I will get with the pita instead. After much debate between pizza and reuben I went with the Reuben...because lets be honest I wanted fries. When it came out I thought the portion was a little small, but I only ended up eating half anyway with the spinach dip app. Great flavor and loved the fries too!

I was very impressed. I got the chicken curry, salad and a drink for $10. The chicken curry was very good. Tasted like home made and had very nice spice heat to it.  This place is really nice for a ""fast food"" type Mediterranean eatery. It reminded me of a Subway Sandwich type set up where you let them know what you want on your order while they make it in front of you. 
    For my drink they had a fresh lemon and cucumber water on the drink line which was so delicious and refreshing.

trn_3897,"First I'd like to thank Hannah for her amazing customer service. She really went above and beyond helping us take home our pup and was extremely knowledgeable about everything. She really made the process for me and my boyfriend very enjoyable. 

Second there's a lot of bad reviews the stigma around pets stores is not the best. Our toy Aussie came home happy, healthy, and full of life I actually tracked down the breeder of our toy Aussie myself and spoke with her amazing lady. Our pup came from a beautiful ranch she even sent me more pictures of his parents! They do not buy there dogs from puppy mills. Pet land is owned by owners and not a corporation so just because one store abuses the system does not mean they all do.

Third yes the prices of the puppy are high but they offer financing. If you expect to get a some of these premier dogs for less than $1000 anywhere it's not going to happen and in my situation we would have never been able to come straight out of pocket for our toy Aussie because they are very expensive dogs. At the end of that day price isn't even a issue when it comes to a life long companion at this point I would've spent a million dollars on him. They also send you home with over $200 in supplies, warranty, and basically anything and everything you'll ever need for your pup.

Yes people will judge you for buying a dog at a pet store but who cares what other people think if you have an instant connection with a puppy buy it! you only have one life and it's too short not to be happy. 

We love our Aussie so much and we can't express enough how much love, and joy he has already brought us",1
trn_3898,"Ughhh, you know I hate to write negative reviews.  
Let's just say the employees here could use a little, okay, a lot more training.  I handed my DD app to the cashier to redeem the offer and the guy looked confused and didn't know how to close out the transaction.
Then when I went to drink my XL cup of coffee and the darn coffee spills ALL OVER my laps and chair!  Soooo glad I was not drinking this while sitting in my car~ I would have had a fit!  
I went back to the counter to try to figure out what was defective with the cup and it turned out the rim of the XL cup was deformed (it looked old and all smashed in) when I pointed this out to the girl, she insisted that all the XL cups were the same.  Grrrr, it was pointless.
I didn't want my morning ruined so I just asked her for another cup of hot coffee.  She doesn't pour me a fresh one, instead she just poured my spilled, left over coffee into another XL cup.  
Shaking my head, I took my cup and left.  After all, it was NYE, no point in getting worked up about this.  I even wished her Happy New Year.

You'd think that would be a must for any restaurant claiming to be a Steak House, but it's not always the case.  The side dishes compliment the main course well, and they have a nice beer and wine selection.  Service has always been good and relatively quick, even with a large group.  If you live in the Chandler area, or are visiting, DC is worth checking out.",1
trn_3901,"I wanted to love this place but it wasn't all that great.  The interior wasn't inviting or comfortable in anyway. I got the sense it's the same regulars that occupy the bar top.  The patio is where it's at but you're SOL during the summer months.  I thought the beer selection was lacking as well, I've heard its pretty stellar but maybe we came on an off day.",0
trn_3902,The shop is great and the atmosphere is welcoming. Brandon runs a tight ship and is very knowledgeable about the actual process and it made my first tattoo experience very simple and easy to set up. I've since gotten 2 tattoos by Evan who is crazy good and I hope to get tattooed by some of the other artists soon.,1

trn_3904,"Where else are you going to find a place that's open on sundays & mondays? My son, my husband & my little brother come here often to get a haircut. I love how Jay and his crew take their time cutting hair. It is not rushed unlike other places and they take the time to give you what you want. Jay is a phenomenal business person and barber, and without a doubt, we will continue coming here. You get what you pay for, quality over quantity. I love how his barbershop is convenient and we can walk in and be taken care of right away. Plus Jay is so friendly, it's easy to have a full on conversation with him.",1
trn_3905,Neither slow seating or waiting over 5 mins for coffee will dissuade me from going back to get another apple pancake. Everyone has an off day and this was one for the OPH. An old school diner that offers a few healthy items and two pages of wonderful breakfast gluttony. I love the irony of this joint just a short walk from glitzy fashion place mall. A long line forms on the weekend so get there early or take a news paper to kill the 30+ minute wait. No plastic here...OPH is cash only so remember to bring a few Jacksons with you.,1
trn_3906,"I checked out this place for the first time and I liked it a lot.
There's a parking lot right at the door, so if you come early you're guaranteed a spot. The receptionist is a gregarious girl who loves to joke around. When you enter, you hang your coat,take off your shoes, give your car keys to the receptionist in exchange for a key to the locker and walk to the change room. The change room is spacious and there are about 6 showers if I counted right. Each shower has a bottle of shower gel, which you can also use as shampoo as the direction says. Each of the 3 basins also has a uniquely scented anti bacterial soap.There's a towel by the basins.
I just wish there were more towels to use, because I don't think anybody wants used towels to dry their hands with. 

The hot yoga room is warm enough to make you completely sweaty by the end of the moksha practice. The instructor doesn't actually do the yoga. He just talks and walks around to adjust everyone. So, if it's your first time you have to look at others to follow. There were mainly young people at this studio and about 80% were girls in all shapes and sizes. You can definitely tell who's more advanced and who's not. I think I was amongst the intermediate who could hold most, if not all of the poses. The room has a dimmed light, but it's enough to see the pipes on the ceiling when you look up. I couldn't help but to think how great it would be if the ceiling was covered. 

Also, make sure you bring slippers when you walk out the hot room, because the floor can be very slippery when everyone walks around with their sweaty feet.",1
trn_3907,"Worse place I have ever lived. The apartments are nice but if anything breaks it can take maintenance up to 10 months to fix it (even if it is something easy). The office staff has no idea what they are doing, they lose rent payments then charge a late fee even if you provide them with the receipt they gave you for your payment. They are friendly, nice and will do anything to get you to move in but once you sign the lease your stuck and they ignore you to try and help more people sign leases.",-1
trn_3908,"Great food, awesome presentation! I liked the fact that they make everything from scratch. The food there was light and healthy, not at all typical restaurants in the area. No greasy food at all. Horchata is to die for! My husband and I will definitely going back!",1
trn_3909,"I stopped by because I was out shopping and didn't feel like eating Carl's jr. . The parking lot was packed, there were people standing outside the restaurant, and all but two tables were full when I arrived. I waited in line behind one person, and ordered my food. I got the number one, which is a gyro with fries and drink for $8.95. I was in and out of there in less than 5 minutes with hot fresh food. The gyro was delicious, and the meat was falling out of it there was so much of it. Their fries are a little different and really awesome. I was really surprised at the speed of service. The girl behind the counter was nice, the guy who presented my food was nice, everybody was super polite and helpful. The restaurant was clean. Really, no complaints. I'll definitely come back.",1
trn_3910,"Absolutely among the best bagels I've ever had- as others have noted, a nice combination of Montreal and NY style. Crispy, dense, moist on the inside, AND they are not remotely stingy with the excellent cream cheese. Go simple: Plain, sesame or poppy with plain cream cheese, you'll thank me. An absolute treasure.",1
trn_3911,"I really loved this venue. It is probably the smallest venue I've been to. But for a smaller venue, the sound was great! I've been to small venues that tend to lack in sound. But, Rebel Lounge has the sound engineering down to a science. It was really clean, which is hard to come by with little venues such as RL. My only negative comment is that there is a large area for 21+ that was nowhere near filled, and then people packed like sardines in the ""all ages"" section. Thankfully for me, I'm 21+ and I had no desire to get super close to the band I was watching. But I imagine if you are under 21, or you just really wanted a good look at the band, this could be unbearable. Also, the only available bathroom was in the ""all ages"" section, so you had to squeeze through a lot of people in order to use the commode. Not a huge deal, but it did cause me to ""hold it"" for a longer than usual time. Other than that, this is a great spot to go support live music! Go check out a band!!",1

Not in KiKu or Sushi on 7 or Suygon.

Not till 2 pm we were told seat will be really soon behind us there is people like us not being serve at all.  Start or first order at 215.  Wait long 20min finally food on table . Keep searching for server to make the second order.  All together we got 3 chances to make order and a girl come by !  !! we were eating!,!  and told us it is the last call. We make our final order and also remind her some food not coming yet.  OK she soon bring the food to us.  Not more  than ten minutes server bring in a bill and put on the table ,,,Thank you she said Tips included She added! When I ask her if  I can paid credit card Serer said go to the cashier to paid.  There was a long line.  When we go back to our seat, all our food on the table gone!  Including my desert.  All above are poor customer service and is totally unacceptable.  Their manager call Fanny, cant get hold with her.  Wow,  it is very reasonable to acknowledge food not finished most not even start to eat.  I would say they intentionally to do that.  Is there something wrong with the restaurant that they don't want customer any more or they treat the server badly to make them bad to customer in return.",-1
trn_3913,"We have been coming to the two offices (Shea and Deer Valley) since our children were born (one in 2000 and one in 2005).  The doctors used to be good.  Lately, you can never get your doctor, always someone new.  They schedule appointments and then actually take you an hour and a half late (why don't you call us and let us know you're running so late).  

Random doctors you get don't seem to be knowledgeable or care.  Several times we've gotten wrong diagnosis, including this week.

It is sad that this originally a very good office gotten so bad.",-1
trn_3914,"Hey!

if you want to go into a store and feel like a piece of shit, they've got you covered. The few times I've entered this store, it has gone like this; 
* 5-6 employees standing in the middle/cash area. 
* No greeting
* No ""Can I help you find anything?""
If you do happen to ask for help, because you have to idea what the fuck you're looking at (due to the lack of descriptors on the products), you will not get any. This is how it will go;

You: Hey, do you carry anything for oily skin?
Employee: Ummmmmmmm there's stuff over there *points to a shelf on the other side of the store* 
You: Where?
Employee: Just on that shelf over there *points at nothing*
You: Okay, which one? 
Employee: Yes. 

I would suggest going to LITERALLY ANY OTHER DECIEM LOCATION. The one in Kensington Market is the one with the best staff.

Side note: I live in the Distillery District in one of the high rise condos! So I'm actually not the least bit poor. Maybe a tip to the staff would be to not judge people based off of their appearance, and to treat everyone equally!",-1

trn_3918,"I didn't realize that you could have a favourite beer store, but I guess I do, and this one isn't it.  It does what it needs to do, but I'll admit there are better in the city.  It should be pretty simple, you return empties, you select beer, you pay for beer, you leave.  And you're able to do that here, no question.  It's probably the little things that are missing.

There are two queues that appear as soon as you enter the place, one for returns and the other for purchase, fair enough.  When I got there, both lines were being dealt with adequately.  They were sold out of the beer that I was looking for (does that even happen these days?) and I think that's part of the problem I have with this particular beer store franchise.  The selection seems to be much more limited here than at other beer stores I've been to.  Their keeping of beer boxes in a cooler shelf also seems to wreak havoc on the box strength.  The storage of the beer in a half-cool-half-warm area seemed to weaken my box and ripped the handle at the side, causing the box to fall to the sidewalk and bust bottles inside.  Ah, well.  No use crying over spilt beer.",0

trn_3921,"We chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice. Waiter was very enthusiast and funny. Had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking. BLT fried green tomato appetizer is a must have. We split the blue plate for our meal. Watermelon was tasty, chicken as well. Chicken wasn't anything special for me, but I am by no means a fried chicken expert. Only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch.",1
trn_3922,"Farm-to-fork fresh and SO tasty! I went in with a Groupon in hand and left extremely satisfied. We had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Arugula Salad and OMB Copper on draft. The pizza crust is thin, chewy and absolutely delish. Toppings are piled on heavy but thats just fine by me. I'll eat them off my plate with a fork, no problem ;)
Without a deal, the prices are a bit on the high side. You're paying for the farm-to fork quality here. 

With or without a deal, I shall return. It's that good.

Validated parking available for 7th street garage.",1
trn_3923,Great local neighborhood bar with fantastic food.  The beer selections are great and the prices are reasonable.  Try the Turkey Rachel sandwich with homemade chips.  Or the Irish Stew.  Weekend Irish Bands are great fun as well,1

The goblet drink was tasty but seemed to lack much alcohol for the price, as I drank the majority of one and felt barely a buzz. Service wasn't bad, but we were there pretty early in the morning so the place wasn't that busy at all yet we only saw our server a couple of times. I'd consider returning to try another drink and a dessert, but not for anything else.",0

As I open the door a sweet smell of home cooking ticked my nose. I walked into smiling faces and a welcoming vibe. I told them this was my first time and recommended that I get the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese. As watched him pile the meat on my bun, I knew I was in the right joint! Once my sandwich was made and paid, I went over to the drink area. I was pleasantly surprised with the choices of sauces and iced tea. I had the watermelon and sweet tea mix. I picked a seat and dove in. With the soft sounds of country music and friendly owner checking on everyone, I felt at home. Everything was beyond my expectations.

It's located in the older Gold Coast Casino, is a bit rundown but with authentic and low priced servings.  We had a nice beef satay with pineapples and enoki mushrooms (more Hawaiian than traditional Cantonese).  We also had a disappointing clay pot with ginger mushroom chicken.  The rice was flavorful, but there was no ginger, barely any mushrooms, and a lot of bony chicken scraps.  You can also have a Heineken here for $3.50.  Overall, ok for the price, but I suspect it can probably be a better place than what we experienced.   Service was also a bit poor, with no water refills, and it took a while for the rice pot to appear.",0

The men outside were demeaning and rude beyond belief, bringing us to tears.

It is such a shame because I think it is a fun place but I will never accept being treated like that.",-1

The selection of foods is excellent E,g,.tender meats, fresh fruits like berry platters, always just an amazing selection and quality for the price. Fresh shrimp cocktail, etc etc. Desserts are tasty creme brulee among tons more.

Let me emphasize that while every hotel has a buffet, this place has QUALITY food and selection worthy of kings. Mmm mm mm - this is always a must-do when we hit up Vegas.

One of my favorite things about this hotel is that they are very pet friendly and there are no pet fees.  The best part was that Eric went out of his way to take me and my family to the residential pool when things got a little too loud for my kids at their own pool facility.  We couldn't thank Eric enough for what he had done for us.  He really knows how to take care of his guests.  Lots of great restaurants around the area.  It was a great stay.  Highly recommended.",1
trn_3939,"Great little coffee shop downtown, delicious coffee, wonderful sandwiches, fresh salads and homemade soups, although they tend to run out especially of their incredible clam chowder.

Lovely comfy cozy rooms with ample light, a main room with overstuffed chairs & sofa, others with wooden chairs, even a picnic style, & all with delightful artwork & handmade crafts - for sale. Nouveau riche boutique, pricey but nice. They also have umbrella shaded tables outside. Live acoustic music some evenings otherwise fairly quiet as rooms are sectioned off like a home with the glass counter where you place your order at the heart. The only downside is the parking is scarce. Very. As there have been too many times I really wanted to stop in, but could find nowhere near enough to park, I haven't been as much. In fact it's been a while but good enough an experience I wanted to share my more positive memories.",1

Due to my curiosity, I went there and found out this lovely studio. They were hosting a party night that weekend, and the director happened to be there when he saw me walking by. So he introduced me to their studio. It was a wild experience - the artists used very creative and interesting techniques making paintings/sculptures on wood and/or using different materials than just traditional canvas or paper. In the party room, someone was doing a talk show, and the next person played guitar. The audience just sat there, having a beer or two, eating some of the snacks provided. Yes the beer and snacks were all free.

I met up with my new cookie expert yelp pal Sol O on his recco that this was THE spot for a mid-day cookie hangout, so we did it up. 

I got a single (walnut free) chocolate chip cookie and it was insane! Warm inside still somehow, soft inside with a little crust all over the outside. Each bite was gooey and sweet, and ... and....magical (hearts over eyes emoji).

I had top escape as fast as possible because I knew if I stayed much longer I'd destroy their entire inventory and then I'd be fat-shaming myself for days to come.

Got the chicken pot pie and the chicken and mushroom.  Both AMAZING.  I have to say I really appreciate the way they loosely wrap them in aluminum foil and then put them in a paper pocket.  I was a little worried that by the time I got back to my office they would only be lukewarm, but they were still piping hot, and since they weren't sealed in tightly, they weren't soggy at all.

They have a good variety for you to choose from for a set price of $9.50 which comes with a free hot drink.  Where they get you is all the side dishes. They offer many mouth watering side dishes like chicken wings, deep fried chicken, pork cutlet for just $2.75 if you ordered a noodle soup.  Although the price is right, I noticed the taste and quality of their side dishes have deteriorated a bit. For example, our fish puff tasted like it has been stored in the freezer for a bit too long, lacking that fresh taste. Also, a order of wings only comes with 3 tiny wings. I think 4 is a better number, why? Just because...

I also didn't enjoy my ginkgo pepper soup base.  It could be just me but the soup base was very bland. Almost tasted like I was slurping noodles from a bowl of hot water with a slight hint of fish flavouring.",0

Doors were opened half hour before the actual event.  Get there early with some takeout food and drinks and enjoy your meal before painting for the next 2.5hrs.  This is also a great time to wet the entire canvas to soften it up.  There's a tasty Soul Food place next door named Call Me Cake that have great home baked slices of cakes and pies.  

The instructor Heather was mic'ed up and music is played in the background.  She spoke clearly that it wasn't difficult to follow her directions.  Also, make friends with your neighbors, they may be able to give you some tips on paint mixing ratios etc.  I would encourage everyone to use the instructor's directions as the foundation and guideline and be brave and creative to add in your personal vision to your art.

trn_3959,"This was definitely the most unpleasant meal we had while visiting Las Vegas. 

I could talk about the rude hostess, the long wait, or the vanishing server but I think I will focus on the food. 

The food itself is about the same quality as a Denny's. We started with a pizza as an appetizer, and it tasted like something purchased in the frozen food aisle and warmed up in a microwave. I expect food to be overpriced in Vegas, but at the very least it should taste good.

We should have known better after the pizza experience, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt and proceeded to order the street tacos. They were miniature, cold, and barely edible. Quite honestly, these tacos were insulting to tacos everywhere.

After realizing how awful the food was, we went next door to Shake Shack. After our experience at Tom's Urban, Shake Shack tasted like heaven.

I have never felt the need to write a Yelp review until my meal at Tom's Urban. I'm trying really hard to think of one positive thing to say...but I am drawing a blank. If you want to stay open in a city with so many great restaurants, you'll have to do better.",-1
trn_3960,"Perfect meal and flawless service! Excellent job Nolen Kitchen, we will be back.  Tonight we ate at Nolen Kitchen and were thoroughly impressed.  The service was spot on; polite, efficient, and extremely attentive.  Our food was perfect.  I ordered the sea scallops with risotto.  The scallops were cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth good, and a good size.  Risotto was also fantastic.  My husband ordered the braised short ribs, another win.  My son wanted the kids pizza with mushrooms and not a crumb was left.  We took everyone's recommendation and started with the zucchini chips. Yep they're right, a must order!  Chips were crisp, well seasoned, and accompanied by a great dipping sauce.  All in all a wonderful Friday night out dinner.  Definitely recommend!",1
trn_3961,We go often and the food is always yummy.  Try the specials.  I love their bread!  Be prepared for a food coma afterwards.  The atmosphere is quite interesting you almost feel like this is where the boys hold their meetings although I have yet to see this.  The have a separate dining room that is usually occupied by some Shriner's type groups.  It doesn't matter anyways because trust me if you are there it's definitly for the food.,1
trn_3962,"I went to the Ten Spot for a first time wax, because I've heard such great things about the place. And for a beginner, they were great. They explained what they were doing as they did it so I wasn't confused or freaked out, they were gentle (as much as one can be when ripping out your hair) and encouraging. It was super quick to do, and I loved the convenience of booking online. It turned out a bit lopsided, but that was my own fault - they leave the room at the end so you can check to make sure they didn't miss anything, and I didn't notice the lopsidedness until I went home. Oops.

However, when I got home I also noticed that there was some wax on my shirt, up by the collar. There must have been some on the waxing bed itself in order for that to happen.",1
trn_3963,"Came in to get contacts & glasses prescription renewed. Booked appointment, arrived on time...60 min wait.... They forgot to measure my eyes for contacts. Came in a few days later...another hour wait time. The Oakley glasses I purchased were $50 cheaper online. Paid the $25 for expedited shipping... 4 days later the glasses arrived.",-1
trn_3964,"I came here with a ton of friends a couple weeks ago both on a Monday and on a Thursday night! In comparison to other AYCE places I've been to, this one blew the others away. The restaurant is in a beautiful location and is really well decorated. As far as the service goes I would rate it a solid 7/10 only because I feel there were dishes brought to us we didn't order and also some we never got. We also ran out of water quite a few times and had to ask to have them refilled.
The food quality for AYCE is far above others I've had before. I feel like everything was really flavorful and tasted fresh. Also it was a bit more expensive than other AYCE places I've been to.
On one of the nights my friend shattered a glass in her hand and they rushed over to be sure she was alright. They made it a big priority to be sure she was okay and also to clean the glass and water off of our table.
Overall I'm really impressed! (Which is why I requested to come back a second time my last night in Toronto) I'll definitely be back when I visit again!",1
trn_3965,"On weekday evening after work, met up here with a friend for some cold flavored iced teas.  Liked the atmosphere and all the eclectic furniture which made our sit down interesting.  Server was helpful answering our questions about menu, since it was our first time trying the place.  Cool environment to chill out and have a conversation.  Tea flavors were rich and the cups they came in were colorful.  Didn't get to taste food here, but they had a neat menu selection of coffee, teas, and desserts which would be good to try next visit.",0
trn_3966,"The epitome of ""country kitchen"". The sweet staff and obviously fresh home cooked meals warmed me from the inside out. I felt like I was back at grandma's. The items on the menu and decor are very...how do I say this...Anglo Saxon? So if you're in the mood for something very traditional, they've got it. If you're in the mood for something exciting, keep walking. I'll probably never go back again, but that's not because it left me unsatisfied, but because I can't imagine ever being back in Schomberg again.",1

trn_3969,This Rosati's at ValVista/Elliot is a disaster. Very inconsistent quality of pizza and terrible service. I drive down to the power rd location now to get my chicago deep dish. I just had one last night and it was awesome! Great location! I am from Chicago too.,1
trn_3970,"Sampled a few of their tacos, guédilles, drinks and desserts. All-in-all, quite good! The tacos average about $5 each but come with two shells and a decent amount of toppings, so we were able to split each order into two easily without them being too skimpy. I actually preferred the guédille (tried the pork one) to the tacos but both were quite good. We had a seasonal pumpkin taco which had no dairy and frankly didn't really need it. It was pretty flavourful and had a pumpkin seed salsa which seemed pretty original.

The desserts were good, but out of the three (we sampled a bunch between all of us) one really stood out which was the ice cream sandwich. 

Cocktails were quite nice as was the atmosphere. It is pretty small in there so if you're looking for some intimacy, maybe not the place to go. We were seated at the bar and had a plethora of take-away customers standing beside and behind us. Service was a weeeee bit slow but the food made up for it. I'll be back!",1
trn_3971,This is a great place for kids. I even jumped my self. My only complaint. The kids on staff could be much more attentive. The last time we went they were talking more to each other.,0
trn_3972,"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to 
The food had set out in that refrigerator part where the desserts are for quite some time because the food was refrigerator burnt. When they brought the food it was ice cold when I asked the waitress if she could warm it up the manager came over and was so rude.. the manager was so rude. We had a party of three my sister never received her food and they drop the food in the back and it looks like they picked it up off the floor and shopped it on my friends dish.we walked out I will never ever go back to that place again Worst customer service worst manager worst food very very disappointed Department of health services should be involved with the preparation of the food",-1
trn_3973,"I think that something I have to keep in mind when writing this review is that, due to my intense appreciation for the yelp community, I was already aware from previous reviews that I might feel overcharged for the portions at Butcher & The Brewer. 
While I might say this place gets 5 stars for their bar alone (reasonably priced, great beer), the fact that the rest of the experience (and the food) isn't as accessible (re: high prices, small portions) makes it hard to award the elusive 5 stars, top-of-the-line review. In fact, the ordering experience and food prices left me thinking 3 stars, so an average of 4 sounds about right. 

Here are my thoughts:

Overall, I enjoyed my experience which consisted of beer and a charcuterie board at the bar. It was a bit loud, but the other patrons were friendly, and there was a wide selection of [silent] TV channels on the big screens above the bar. 

I really enjoyed their beer selection. While the bartender seemed uninterested in telling me about the beers (bummer), she was nice enough about letting me taste a few in order to make a decision. I tried the Hasselhefe, Framboyzee, and Spice Spice Baby (their holiday/christmas/winter beer). The Hasselhefe was mild, and a little bit sweet- I could see it being very popular on a hot day. I was not thrilled with the framboyzee- it was fruity, but lacked the tart and funky the description promised. The Spice Spice Baby was by far the best- spicier and smoother than the Christmas Ale from Great Lakes, for sure. I also tried their Gourdy (the Pumpkin beer equivalent) and was unimpressed- the spice was there, but it was lacking all things pumpkin.

As far as the Charcuterie board goes- get it. Just get it. For one person, it can basically be a meal. Not only do you get the cheese/meat, but mine came with some great mustard, honey, and pear compote that complimented the different meats and cheese and amazing toasts and buttermilk crackers. Strongly recommend the chicken liver mouse. The only downside was the bartender's informing me that the menu online isn't accurate; it appears the online menu includes all of the possible options, only about 1/3-1/2 of which were available or on that day's menu. While I missed the buratta, the board I got was still pretty good.",1
trn_3974,"I referred some friends to Reliable who recently moved to Scottsdale.  Dustin was prompt in his response to their concerns and he was very thorough in his inspection of the pool equipment.  

It's always a nice thing to deal with the owner of a small business.  They seem to have a passion to help you out while the larger companies push profits over you.  This was especially true when Dustin figured out a warranty issue around the existing pool pump.  

I recommend Reliable Pool Care.",1
trn_3975,"Stopped by on a chilly evening to meet some friends for a birthday party. I would not recommend this restaurant for a group outing as there are very few tables that seat over 4 people. I would recommend (the) Wedge for a date, however! It is cozy and the atmosphere is lively. Servers were attentive and didn't mind our party being laid back about ordering. I tried a delicious añejo, the guacamole, and a pastor taco. The drinks are reasonably priced for the location and atmosphere, and the bartenders/waitstaff are educated about the drink menu. The guacamole comes in a very small portion but it was quite good (I found the chips to be greasy though). The tacos were tasty.. perhaps not as authentic as el charro or maize but decently priced at $3 for what you get (quite a filling portion and the taco was piled with lots of extras, including roasted pineapple and chile de arbol salsa--yum!). 

I'm not sure that I will be back immediately but it's a worthwhile spot to check out if you want something a little different for the area.",0
trn_3976,"All I have to say is WOW! What a great company! Our 19 yr old ac died on Sunday morning. We called a few places for quotes over the phone and to have someone come out early Monday morning. We got a referral from my father in law to also call Penguin Air.  I am very glad we did!  We spoke with William (the owner) late on Sunday evening about replacing our unit.  He was very knowledgable and patient with all of our questions.  He gave us a VERY fair price compared to the other quotes.  We decided on a 5 ton 14 seer Trane. 

They came Monday morning with EVERYTHING...CRANE AND ALL. The team was very clean, courteous, thorough, and worked very hard installing our unit as quickly as possible. We had COLD air blowing through the house by 3:30 pm the very next day!  William also stopped by as his team finished up to make sure everything was going perfectly and to go over everything with us to ensure we were satisfied. We were very impressed to say the least.

Having your ac go out really is a stressful and (hot!) situation to be in, especially in 105+ AZ summer weather.  It is refreshing to deal with such an organized, professional company that gets the job done right!  I highly recommend them for your future ac needs.  Thank you for the stellar service Penguin Air!!  A++++!",1
trn_3977,This place never disappoints. Their $2.00 taco Tuesday is worth the trip up there. great sandwiches and crispy fries and onion rings. Haven't tried the wings yet.,1
trn_3978,This place is a RIP OFF scam.  Be careful!!!!  They had my company come out and tint the store front and were completely happy with the work we did.  They refuse to pay us a dime.  It was thousands of dollars.  We are pursuing and they told us too bad.  Be careful about this place and maybe Google a little about them first.  It's amazing what you'll find.,-1

One was an exterior patio fan and the other was installing 2 pendant lights in our bedroom.

I couldn't be happier with our new lights and fan! I highly recommend them!!",1

trn_3984,"Always loved the Thomas and Scottsdale location. Just opened this one near our house. Figured we'd get some poke impromptu. Checked the hours on the website. 9pm close. Get here at 5 min to close. Doors are locked and staff is inside fully ready to go. Don't get me wrong. We knew that it would be last minute and that the fish wouldn't be the freshest, but we also would expect the doors would remain open until at least the POSTED time on the doors and website. We drove all the way here specifically because of the great food but after this horrible waste of time? I'm not so sure.",-1
trn_3985,"I finally got to try out this ramen joint recently...and I absolutely loved it!  I tried their very appetizing Fried Chicken, as well as their super-spicy Ramen...and both were amazing!  The Japanese Fried Chicken was SO delicious (perfectly fried and battered), I had to fight myself not to eat the whole thing (yes, calories!).  The spicy ramen bowl (I think it was the Buta Bowl?) with melt-in-your-mouth pork belly was incredibly good...and indeed hot 'n spicy, even for my Asian taste buds.  The restaurant wasn't visible from the street I was coming from...and it's a very small restaurant, but it made unique use of space with a very cool patio, overlooking the light rail.  Also, service was super-fast and friendly.  Overall, it was top notch in every way...food, presentation, service, even with its quirky ambiance.  Obviously I'm now a fan, and I plan to return...hopefully even drag my husband in (though he's not a ramen lover, he may change his mind?)!",1
trn_3986,"When we 1st walked in thru the patio area, we were looking for a host stand. We peeked around the bar, saw a host stand and were seated immediately. This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!

Update! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great. All 5 of us really loved everything. This place is highly recommended.",1
trn_3987,"Just took the Sunday 10:00am class with Jen.  I bought a 1st users 3pack for $40.00 online. By booking the class in advance, there was accountability which is a major motivation.  It is clear you can also just show up in person for a class but that may change as more people find out about this gem in king west.

PROS:
Super Convenient - Right across the street from my apartment with enough mid-morning and late evening classes.  

Staff/Owner were very approachable - Amy (owner) introduced me to the studio, gave me a tour since I arrived 15 minutes earlier and introduced me to the instructor, Jen  gave the class clear instructions and she seemed to know all the names of the regulars.

Class - Varied, I can't wait to take other instructors as well.  Instructions were clear, the music was mellow and my legs were shaking the whole time.

CONS:

Socks - Unlike other Barre Studios I had been to, the room wasn't carpeted and they didn't sell the socks.  The floor was clean and cork but it was cold!  

I have already booked the two other classes and will definitely try and make it there!",1
trn_3988,This place has such an unique ethnic fusion. I love the carribean jerk rice and the black refried beans. Everything I have ever gotten here was excellent. I highly recommend it!,1

They have good quality food, good meats Prime Rib, Lamb, Veal, Turkey etc. Good seafood selections - Crab legs, Mussells, shrimp even Poke and sashimi sushi and  etc. Many salads and sides selections. Desserts here are one of the best - Creme brulee, eclairs, big choc strawberries, custard, cakes etc....Its a bit pricey like the Wynn and may have a line to get in maybe a 15-30 min wait depending......This is a quality food buffet, if you are a picky eater, The Wynn, Paris and Bellagio are for you....",1
trn_3990,"We recently took a weekend getaway to Phoenix and stayed here. The Hotel is beautiful and our rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The staff here are topnotch. I love the lobby wine & hot apple cider hour in the afternoons, and the lobby coffee & hot chocolate bars in the mornings. We had access to the Golds Gym across from the hotel and were able to get a good workout in their cardio theatre. There is an outdoor skating rink right outside and a small shopping/dining area. It is located right across from the stadium and could walk to our event. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you are attending an event at the arena.",1
trn_3991,"My grandparents and I had a nice evening here. We lucked out and got to see a wonderful pianist and guitarist sing and perform! Apparently they do that every Friday night from 7:30-9:30pm. It truly made the night for us. The food was a little slow to come out and it took a while for us to get our check, but staff were still friendly. All of our food was authentic and delicious! I will say I think the tables are a little close together because before the musicians came, I could hear all the conversations around us way too easily. Would recommend this place on a Friday night for sure though!",1
trn_3992,"We love this place! Wonderful service (they even let us watch the NCAA game on the stage big screen on a Saturday afternoon), and amazing food. the vegetarian chimichanga is perfect -- lots of buttery cauliflower, broccoli, onions and mushrooms, not too heavy on the frying and smothered in melted rich cheddar. Top that with their pico de gallo and salsa from individual carafes on the table, and sour cream and it's just the best. 

Also the atmosphere is fun, not stuffy in the least, and the ceiling opens on nice days, giving a feeling of being outside somewhere friendly and tropical. We'll be back!",1
trn_3993,"This is our go to celebration restaurant. Anniversary, birthday, friends in town or just TGIF we are going to Ryu. My 5 year old boy loves it and eats everything on his plate and loves to talk to the chef while he's cooking. Price is great and the food was quantity and taste is amazing. Even when people want to go out for a steak dinner we recommend Ryu and it's always a hit. Some of the best steak and tuna we've ever had.",1
trn_3994,"Have been back a couple times since. The food is still good. The prices went up slightly. But overall the big change is in the service. 

No one expects a sushi place to have good service but to have service that ruins your dinner? That's unacceptable. We had 3 servers help us over the course of the night, one kept forgetting to bring the things we asked her for, such as water and napkins and soy sauce (seriously they forgot soy sauce at a sushi place?!) another was so rude I couldn't believe it. And then the third was yelled at by a family at another table for sneezing in their food and walking away, and then they sent her our way!!! No thanks I don't want your sneeze near me. 

After we paid and left we yelled back, ""thanks for being rude."" Now I really won't go back.",-1
trn_3995,"Excellent Vet and beautiful, immaculate facility.  We brought our new puppy for her first exam and her 6 and 8 week shots combined.  The charges were MORE than reasonable.  They also offered free pet insurance for 30 days on her.  We have definitely found our new vet!",1
trn_3996,"So this is the 2nd Chipotle restaurant I've been in.  I was shopping in the area and decided to stop here and give it another try.

First plus, it was 2pm and it wasn't busy.  I hate standing in line. 

2nd plus...they have a list of popular menu option as you enter the door and then a large menu with large print above the prep station (wish Qdoba would take a lesson here).  

So I went with one of those popular menu choices - a fajita burrito.  I have to say, I was actually impressed with the flavors.  The hot salsa left my lips tingling which is a good thing with me.  The chicken, peppers and onions had great flavor mixed in with the guac and lettuce.

I'm still not impressed with the decor of Chipotle - cheap looking tables and chairs with metal walls that make me think I'm in a metal shop somewhere.  But the food made a better impression on me this time around and I think I'd probably try Chipotle again.",0
trn_3997,"Super tasty well prepared delicious food.  GB Hand-pulled Noodle has a small well curated menu.  You could choose the width of the Noodle when you order.  Service was fast but not hurried.

We started with 3 sides.  The cucumber with chili was amazing - We ordered a second.  The cucumber was crunchy, the sauce was quite savory.  The jellyfish was the tastiest version I've had. - it was delicious. The chili beef was great with the right balance of beef with chili made even better with fresh cilantro.

Despite the meat centric menu, the server was able to make suggestions that satisfied vegetarians in my party.  The server provided a serving of cucumber with chili and tea eggs - perfectly prepared in lieu of pork or beef.

I had the Pork with Hand-pulled noodles with a broth on the side.  Other non-vegetarians in my party ordered the Mega size Lanzhou Beef Noodles.  The Mega size serving was so large that no one could finish the serving.  The only criticism about the Mega sized Beef Noodles is that the Beef to Noodle ratio was too low.  Perhaps we'll be ordering the large Beef Noodles with extra Beef next time we're here to improve the ratio.

Overall great meal!  I highly recommend GB Hand- pulled Noodles.",1
trn_3998,"The food is ok, but everything is pretty much fried. I don't know if it was a bad night or what but our dining experience was a circus of errors. We started with the cheese curds which to this Californian were mind-blowing! Holy crap, how come we don't have those in CA??? It's a probably a good thing we don't have them in CA or else I would be obese. 

The food was mediocre, they couldn't seem to get the food right for one of the members in my party and every time they tried to correct it, it still didn't come out right. 

I think they need to take a step back and really work on the things that make a restaurant great- high quality food, and excellent customer service. They were really trying with the customer service, but it just wasn't working Friday night. Keep it up Cafe Hollander, you have a lot of potential to be better than mediocre.",0
trn_3999,"We were looking for a great place to eat as our last meal and vegas, after some digging around I came upon yard bird. It did not let us down! The fried green tomatoes were heavenly delicious,  strongly recommended those. We also tried the crispy chicken and the blue plate meal. The crispy chicken was on biscuits and the blue plate came with two pieces of fried chicken, biscuits and watermelon.  I recommended the blue plate meal and ask for some apple jam/honey butter for your biscuit.  Service was perfect and the decor is amazing!",1
trn_4000,"Quite possibly the best meal we had in Las Vegas made even sweeter by a free yelp check in offer for a green tamale appetizer and a military discount. We stopped in for lunch and fortunately made a reservation because they filled up in no time right after opening. The waitress was very pleasant and delightful. Almost everything in here is gluten free which made it very easy for my wife. They do provide complimentary chips and salsa which was very enjoyable. The chipotle salsa might be my favorite. The plantain empandas were fantastic, I could have eaten ten. My wife and I each had two tacos for lunch, brisket and fish. Both were so different from each and both amazing. The rice and black beans were delightful as well. We enjoyed our food so much we had to indulge in the flour less chocolate cake which as you can imagine was perfect. It came with a very nice almond ice cream, candied almonds and a thin slice of banana that was fried and nice and crunchy. Oh and yes they have great cocktails here as well. I wish this place was closer to my home.",1
trn_4001,"This place is convenient, being in the same shopping center as LVAC, and I do appreciate the 10% discount for LVAC members. However, I found it to be pretty darn overpriced. When I came in, I felt like the salesperson was pretty pushy and I was pressured into buying something that I wasn't sure if I really wanted.  I actually left it in my car, unopened, because I felt uneasy.

The next day, I went to return it, and before walking in, saw that returns were only for store credit. I was all set to be super irritated, but the sales clerk was very nice and went ahead and refunded my money.  For that reason, Freddie's is okay by me.",0
trn_4002,The Service i will not say rude but is so pushy.  i only come back here when I am really craving Korean BBQ but I don't have choice to go anywhere else for those places have to wait in the line for table.

trn_4007,"Let me start by saying I enjoyed this place.  Tucked right away in Concord the food, the music, the venue is so much more than I expected.  

By way of New York City  I am conditioned for a night of live comedy to be expensive with their two drink minimum and no appetizers under $15, and a line to get in the place.  

This place was a refreshing change.  Good comedy and even better food for a fraction of what you would expect to pay.  The single issue I had is that we could not hear the comic at one point over the crowd.  Due to that we missed a good portion of the show.

The bathrooms are clean, the staff is friendly and attentive.  The crowd is diverse and pleasant.  The music is fun and again...  Did I mention the food?  Pub grub it is NOT.  So I will mention it here again, because I had the very best Turkey Burger of my life last night.  I can hear it calling to me now.

So I gotta go, maybe I will see you there on a comedy Friday night soon.",1
trn_4008,"Generally speaking Original Joe's doesn't really offer anything different in its genre of restaurant, a mid to high end chain restaurant trying to be unique and different from the rest and in most cases failing. When travelling, a place like this is one I generally avoid. Why go some place I can visit back at home? One evening while visiting Calgary my wife and I found ourselves stopping in for a couple drinks and some appetizers. I did not have my hopes up but they were open and it seemed right at the moment. For various chain type restaurants reviews are always difficult, as these places try for some level of standardization while trying to feel unique. Do you review the restaurant as a chain or an individual place. I think there is sometimes room for both, but in this case I honestly felt this location (Stephen Ave) attempted to be different. A credit to management to really create a nice spot with quality drinks, a nice atmosphere and service. The food fits in with their average fair, not amazing but satisfying. Not horrible but you never know you may just crave that favourite dish of theirs from time to time. 

The food and drinks were good, I encourage you to decide for yourself. The real treat from this location was indeed the atmosphere and service. It in no way felt like a chain restaurant and really felt like it belonged on Stephen Ave with the other great niche and unique restaurants. Take a visit and decide for yourself but I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1
trn_4009,The staff at the front desk were very friendly and answered all of my questions. My therapist was very nice and was in touch with how comfortable I was. The massage table is nice and the warmers are great. I would day the only down side is that because I'm a member they didn't have me fill out the paper that says my preferences in a therapist or my focus areas. That only gets filled out your first time. Unfortunately I joined at a different location and the information didn't transfer over.  Overall a good experience.,1
trn_4010,Anthony and Jason are both such wonderful motivators and instructors! Every class has high energy and upbeat music that leaves you in a puddle of your own sweat! Highly recommended!,1
trn_4011,"I've been coming here for a couple years now and the food is really good.The staff is friendly very friendly(thank you guys!) But let me tell you about this ""manager"" jerry. He is a joke!!!, very rude and inconsiderate. This ""man"" has no respect or manners for his guests, honestly I will not be returning here if this p.o.s is still working here. Anna is amazing .. She should be running this show :)...",-1
trn_4012,"I love Chipotle, but this location is just careless. I put in an order online to pickup in an hour and when I got there, it wasn't made. They simply forgot. The cashier even said, ""oh, I don't know why it didn't go through"" with no apology. To make things a worse experience, I found that they didn't include every ingredient I asked for in my order by the time I got home! They forgot 2 items and I didn't have the energy to go back to have it remade. I don't understand how my order was messed up with extra time even after they were already over an hour late with making it to begin with. I won't be eating at this particular Chipotle again.",-1
trn_4013,"Ok folks! I was craving tacos so me and my son saw this place and decided to try it out. I ordered guacamole and chips, pastor tacos, carne asada tacos and chorizo tacos. The place is clean and staff is friendly. Food came out quickly. So far so good. Then comes the guacamole. It was just ok. It needed lime, salt and maybe some cayenne. Then comes the tacos. They were forgettable. I am comparing them to the other places like this establishment. I was just disappointed. Meat was a bit dry and not a lot of flavor. It would work in a pinch but would not go there again over any other place. Plus they are pretty pricey for what you get. The pineapple was the best part. Good Luck Taqueria El Buen Pastor!",-1

I will be ordering this and having this for the new year..WOW!! ....and PS, the portions ... enough for dinner, and lunch the next day!!",1
trn_4016,Love this place. Particularly the hidden bar. This is a very non Vegas place. Bar tender remembers your fave drink and it feels like a 'local' place to be. Food is tasty and the staff are the same faces each time. Love being able to come to a place that I know people.  Very Italian welcoming feel. Great work guys!!!!,1
trn_4017,Total bargain!  Will take Megabus again in the future.  The drivers are very strict and will yell at you if you're talking too loudly but I guess I appreciated that.  The electricity outlets and Wifi didn't work on the trip to NYC but did on the way back.,0

I've referred a few over to her and she's been so great at helping us get affordable insurance and educating us about the different types of insurance. Thank you for your patience you're greatly appreciated",1
trn_4019,"4 stars for giving my taste buds some real spice! This place is perfectly affordable and it doesn't limit you to food such as pizza for their price. If you are ever sick of eating hotel food and don't want to spend a big buck either for something yummy, please try this place out. Super hole in the wall place, but my boyfriend and  are from Orange County and we frequent this place every time we're here. They have sandwiches to Thai food! I always get the pad Thai with chicken. Level spicy 7 ;) my boyfriend gets spicy lvl 12 ;). Trust me they will make your food SPICY as long as you ask or it! FOUR thumbs up!",1
trn_4020,"Don't do it, man.

I got in without waiting and without paying, sat at a VIP table during Memorial Day weekend, and I still thought this place was a waste of time and money. 

ok ok, it's full of lots of young people our age, which is an awesome change from Tryst, for example. All the girls were dressed to the nines and most of the guys could either be Abercrombie models or employess. The line of people trying to get in was at least 85% guys, so, yeah, eye candy everywhere, which is why I gave this place a star.

But I swear, it's not worth it! The club is boring, and the music was really uninspiring. I feel like hot clubs should have amazing DJs and this one does not--not even close. 

The place is packed, which is good and bad but mostly bad if you're trying to move from where you're standing. I thought that the tiny Caramel lounge at Bellagio had WAY better music and people were giving away 2-for-1 drink coupons all night. Go there instead.",-1
trn_4021,"My husband and I went there mainly because we had a 2 for 1 coupon. We were warmly greeted at the door by the hostess (we later found out she was the owner's wife).
The service was excellent (we also found out that our server was also the owner/chef!). The owner's son is also a server!
The food was delicious! With the all you can eat policy, we sure filled up!
It was heartwarming to be in such a nice family's establishment!
We will definately be back!",1
trn_4022,"Of all the crazy places in this crazy world, Max and Ermas had superb potstickers, perhaps the best I've ever had.

I was pleased.

I went there a few times, though, and never found an entree I didn't hate.  So I have to give it an uneven rating -- but if you like potstickers, and feel like making a meal of them, you really should try this at least once.",0
trn_4023,"It's a pub, with live music, beer and deep fried food. The fish and chips were edible, the grilled sweet potato cakes were deep fried and the chef salad was mediocre. 

Meh, it's good for the beer and music and a cool vibe",0
trn_4024,"Great little restaurant tucked in a strip mall, a couple of doors down from BlackLion. 
We came in right near 6 pm and were sat immediately.  Lots of regular customers that the owner and waitress knew by name.  Friendly wait staff, casual environment.  Food was made quickly and came out piping hot. Waitress and the owner checked on us often.  Very good service! 

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with a side salad.  Salad tasted fresh and food was very good.

These folks know the way to my heart because they serve  breakfast allll day! 

We'll be back soon!",1

Amazing ramen, less busy than other places, and great staff.",1

Our cook also kept us entertained. 

We will definitely return for teppanyaki :)",1

trn_4029,I came here with a bunch of friends and I have never been to this place.  I never even knew this place existed.  You only come here to get the spicy rice cakes.   The entire place is korean even the music is korean.   It did feel a bit as if I was in Seoul.  You get a bowl of rice cake and you can tell them the spiciness level.   Even mild can end up being spicy.  They put cheese on top of the bowl.  It also comes with steamed eggs.   It was alright just for the experience.  There are a lot of rice cake restaurants around the area now.   It was ok.  I'll try other places before trying this one out again.,0
trn_4030,"Wow! The crew was so upbeat and energetic you couldn't help yourself from smiling and being in good spirits.  Even with this being their opening,  they still made time to welcome you,  shake your hand and ask if they could assist you. I was very impressed.",1

The ribeye steak was delicious, my husband had the Lebron steak and shrimp dish no complaints at all there. one of my family members had the lamb chops. Everyone raved about their dish. The portions were great also. Our waiters Aaron, Chris, and Dennis were outstanding very attentive. I will definitely recommend this place, and I will return when in Cleveland again",1
trn_4032,"Apparently u need to go with a group of 4 or 3 vs 2 as we got there about 20 min earlier than a group of 4 and had to wait an extra 20 min after they got sat. I complained and they explained that they only have so many 2 man seats. That's complete bullshit. It's completely diff if it's a table that sits 8-10. Obv they don't want to sit 2 but to say 3/4 gets priority is crazy. Also, they have way to much bar seating that u can order from the bar the whole menu but not get the wine along with it. Makes no sense. I haven't even eaten and I hate this place but I'm too hungry to leave. Better be good!",-1
trn_4033,"First time was a charm!

After a few years of driving by this place, we stopped in tonight to try it. Glad we did! Food was delicious, and we met the owner/cook, who prepares everything fresh, and by himself. Service was a bit slow, but it was due to the care and personal attention of the owner.

Highlight was the chicken pesto pizza...best I've ever had. Shrimp scampi appetizer was also fantastic. Fresh baked bread was great, as was the Il Forno pizza. Wood-fired crust makes the pies!

We'll be back...soon. Can't wait to try the homemade pastas. Also happy to support a small business.",1
trn_4034,"The best ribeye I've ever had! The steak was so well marbled and well cooked that there was nothing left on my plate when I was done.

4. Service was excellent!!!! Nothing fancy, just great food!!!!!",1
trn_4037,"Usually I don't pay much attention to the negative reviews of a place, as we like to form our own opinion but...lesson learned.

Table of 6 was sat pretty quickly after we called and were told in a very valley girl accent that they were ""like......10 deep.""

Our server was great. I've seen reviews about bad service, but ours was really attentive. 

Great old fashioned drinks there. Highly suggest.

Here's where the yelp reviews are true:

Avocado toast is SUPER lemony. Overpowering to the whole dish.

Lobster Mac and cheese is fettuccini (which is accurately presented on the menu.) it's not macaroni, which let's be honest...is what we're all looking for. The lobster Mac and cheese at Namastay Kitchen is better. Seriously. 

Biggest charcuterie board only comes with 5 tiny pancakes to use with the cheese. We had to ask for extra. 

And speaking of the charcuterie board, I've seen complaints about things on their website menu being a different price when you get to the restaurant. This is absolutely true. The full blown charcuterie board online was $36, and when we got there it was $50. $50 FOR A CHARCUTERIE BOARD? I'm sorry...I'm not sure you got that. It was $50! I'd love those margins if I were Zeppelin. 

My advice is go grab a drink and a snack, and leave. Immediately.",-1
trn_4038,"Beautiful store but was snubbed and hovered over in the kids section because my kids were getting handsy with the toys. Was planning on buying some books and toys, but hated the feeling of being watched but not helped. We left empty handed thanks to very poor customer service.",0
trn_4039,"There is convenient parking right outside along the building which was nice. Although the place doesn't look like much on the outside or inside, it's the friendly service and delicious food that counts. 

Half of the menu (left side) can be ordered when you get there, but the other half (right side = weekly specials) must be ordered with a call ahead of time. I wanted a weekly special since I made the long drive down, but that's okay, now I know. I ordered the potato and cheese pierogies which were freshly made and extremely delicious. They are dumplings stuffed with a potato and cheese mixture topped with sautéed onions and bacon with a side of sour cream. 

The place itself is extremely small. There are maybe 4 tables. It's less of a dine in and more of a take-out kind of place. I don't advise large groups to come in. There is no seating outside and even water is $1 because they don't provide tap water, only bottled water. 

The owners are a Polish couple who are extremely sweet and kind. They are very friendly and respectful and treat their customers very well. With that being said, the service was excellent. 

I really hope they eventually expand into the next store which seems to be vacant and create a restaurant. With some advertisement they would be packed from the food and service alone.",1
trn_4040,"I certainly can't stand idly by while a new local spot (and something the community has been waiting for) is being punished during their first week in operation due to some minor hiccups. Jeez, has anyone ever heard of opening day/week jitters. 

Folks, listen to me for a second, any of you who follow my reviews know that I'm not about a chain most of the time. Given the choice I did a mom and pop shop or indie biz over the big guys any day of the week. And because of this I tend to judge the chains harsher than others because they have the frame work, training manuals and money to be perfect, so if they're anything but that they really have no excuse. 

That being said, when a chain does something cool, original and outside the box, I gotta give them there due and Firkin On The Bay is doing just that. Something cool, different and exciting. 

I was in on Wednesday this week from 11am until about 5:30 pm working from the bar and got to observe their staff and operating procedures.  

First off the space is brilliant, it's almost a cartoon industrial look with expose fixtures and pipes only in bright fluorescent colors. Pair that with quirky fun graffiti, art and furniture all with a UK feel/vibe and it makes for an aesthetically cool place to be. 
 
The real winner here is the view of the Toronto skyline either from inside behind the floor to ceiling window, or from the wrap around patio out front. It's amazing by day so I can only imagine what it would look like at night. 

My server at the bar was on point with all key messaging, specials and solid menu recommendations. After having a Guinness to start my day I eventually ordered the butter chicken dish which was not exactly true butter chicken but a British pub inspired version. It was more of a butter chicken stew stop red curried mashed potatoes. As relish twist to an Indian classic. I really enjoyed the spin on this dish. 

I think it's important to remember that there will be small quirks and bumps in any businesses first week(s) and the point is to not skewer the business online but to accept that this is a normal thing and to come back in a few weeks to get a better sense for the true experience. 

Eatcrest Out!",1
trn_4041,"Don't expect to order sweet and sour anything. This place is a bit more authentic than the average Canuck might like.   It's also tucked away off Davis Drive and off Harry Walker so the only way to find it is to look behind the hotel. 

The noodle dishes are great, and the Pad Thai is less sweet and more interesting than usual. Portions can be a bit on the small side, but so is the dining room. 

I have been back a few times so far, and this won't be the last time. It has room to grow on me, and so does the rating. 

Let me be clear: this food tastes much better than Mandarin, but is less mainstream than the late Chitose. Newmarket is so desolate in the ""good Chinese food"" category that Cambodian Noodle King is my go to when I can't justify a drive to Markham.",0
trn_4042,"Okaaay, so my fiance really wanted to go here for dinner last night, but I was weary, sounded really greasy. So I talked him into something else, then  again today, pleeeease, Chino Tori? Fine, I gave in. 

I'll give this to Chino, it's an original idea. Mexican, Jamaican and Chinese fusion, but it's not executed well at all. Like someone said before, the whole ordering process, especially for first timers needs to somehow be streamlined, it's ridiculous, like they need a help desk or something. But part of the initiation is you get to taste test before ordering, so I guess that is good.  The location is waaaay back in this weird building, and weird weird, not weird good. There is also way too much space inside, gives it a very cafeteria feel. 

Now to the food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good, as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice. My lunch on the other hand was a disaster, so I ate half of his. I ordered the emerald chicken, then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla, I chose the dilla. Well, that was the wrong choice. See the pic I posted, my quesidilla was glistening!! We could not eat it. It was in a pool of grease. Gross.

So Chino, I have some ideas for ya. Get it together, this is a cool concept, but learn how to make your food consistently good, maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying? Hire a professional to look at your menu and give suggestions for prep. Second, the ordering system needs attention, it's confusing. Thirdly, the space is weird and desolate, some interior changes would be a good thing.",-1
trn_4043,Went there for the first time because my cousin had referred me. When I walked in the receptionist asked if I was a resident because our first time eyebrow wax service would be free. I then realized I didn't have my driver's license on me so I  asked if there was another way to verify me and she stated I needed something with my name and address on it. So as my niece went the room I pulled up my APS bill online. (Obviously APS is an electric company which is only in Arizona) when i pulled up my account it wouldn't show my address but everything else in my profile including recent bills and she still wouldn't accept it. I thought what bad customer service... she was not even willing to give me a rain-check for the next time to be free. I had Alyssa wax my eyebrows and she did amazing (which is the only reason I gave 3 stars). Even Alyssa said there was probably something the receptionist could do. I was definitely NOT impressed. I clearly made an effort to prove I am a resident and its not like she had to swipe my DL she just had to see it.,0

The Mostaccioli was super delicious and there was so much of it! I was able to have some for lunch the next day. The fried mushrooms were so good! The were huge and there wasn't an overkill of the breading. The cannoli was okay but it could have been better.

I would probably order from here again because the food was pretty delicious. I wouldn't mind actually going to the restaurant and trying more of their food there.",1
trn_4048,"Came here for my friend's birthday and we sat at the barrel at the back. When I say barrel, I mean barrel. It was a table made from a huge barrel that seats 4-6 people. 

The decor is absolutely amazing, I love the ambiance of this place and when you order any of the special drinks, you get a huge performance from the Tiki Bar. 

That's as far as I would love, because their drinks, while fancy and well marketed, weren't the greatest. Most of them were too sugary and some of them were just the nastiest combinations of spices and alcohol. Their prices were also a bit steep, but I understand they have to profit from the decor. The most disappointing was the food - their portions were way smaller than we had imagined! For $10 I could just buy a bag of the same wings they serve from loblaw's. But I guess you don't come here for the food, you come for the experience.",0

trn_4052,"This was amazing! Only my 2nd hostel stay, ever, but I am impressed. I think other reviewers were expecting a hotel atmosphere or services. It's not a hotel. But, I like it better. We were a group of 10, and stayed in 2 rooms. Both were spotless. We had both bunk beds and a full/queen bed. Both rooms had a small table and chairs, sheets, pillows, blankets, and lockers (bring a lock). The mattresses were comfortable. Bedroom doors had hotel-like locks and keycards. The open kitchen/dining/living area is huge. Although there is only 1 stove and 1 microwave, and the place was fairly full, there didn't seem to be any trouble accessing the kitchen when we needed it. It was fully loaded and clean. There are cubbies to keep your personal dry foods in and a shared refrigerator. There is a coffee shop on the 1st floor. It was handy. $3 coffee in a mug, that you can get re-filled all day. Since we were in and out all day, that was handy. The rooftop patio was wonderful. We spent each evening up there admiring the lights of the city and the fireworks at the Indians stadium. Tables and chairs on a nice wood platform, with a safety fence around it. There is a washer and dryer on each floor. Stairs only; no elevator, so not really handicap accessible, as far as I know. Within walking distance of West Side Market, Cleveland Candle Co, Penzeys Spice Store, many restaurants, and a nice little park. I'll be back!",1

My husband and I are vegan and finding places to eat without just ordering a salad and fries is very difficult. For our anniversary, he scouted out some Madison vegan/vegetarian-friendly places and this restaurant's menu compelled me to pick it for our date. Why else we loved Monty's:

-Plenty of parking available (in their own lot) in what I thought may be a crammed downtown area
-Delicious menu of breakfast served all day, sandwiches, and desserts (regular or veg/vegan friendly!!)
-friendly staff
-FAST service--we waited maybe 10 min for our food

First off, the facility.. It's fully air conditioned and it's located in an IN DOOR soccer field!! How awesome is that!! The place is so clean and organized. 

The instructors...FANTASTIC !! They really focus on safety and are really motivating. The owner said that they go through ""cycles"" and the cycle I was in was a gymnastic cycle. Which I feel wasn't easy, and I bet on any other cycle they're insane !! Everyone was so welcoming and didn't show anything they couldn't do. Everyone was too awesome and I miss them already  :/ they are worth every penny. If you sign up, you're getting more then your money's worth !

The classes... Every class you have to sign up to reserve your spot and there is a maximum of 15 sign ups... That being said, everyone received the attention that was needed. And every class was always different so that won my heart pretty quick 

Unfortunately, I was not able to sign up. I was visiting family temporarily and purchased a groupon for while I was there to keep me busy. These guys are really passionate about what they do and mean business ! But are also fun and are really inspiring. If you're not there to work, then this place isn't the place for you.

trn_4063,"Best dinner experience during a recent week in Vegas - equal credits due to food, company, service and the ambiance.
I loved my lemon samurai - light enough so I could have a perfectly lucid conversation and remember all of it, yet not trivial enough to pass off as a mocktail! The vegetarian roll doesn't merit too much reflection, but the plaintains and coconut rice lent a nice Latin infusion to the otherwise bland menu.
The ambiance is mighty chic without being uber pretentious like some of the other Palazzo restaraunts. Which means the crowd is about as ""normal"" as you could get in Vegas! Not abnormal is the pricetag - expensive certainly, but heck, I'd rather savor a memorable dinner than watch my money vanish on a table on the casino floor!

trn_4066,"I decided we should get a professional to come check our airflow issues on our second floor and tuneup our furnace. We were pretty confused by our duct system and weren't sure about what went where. 

So glad I called Rudy Cools! Our technician was Charles and he was right on time and very professional. As he performed the tuneup, he discovered our heat pump wasn't working. After some discussion, Charles figured our new thermostat wasn't compatible and recommended we test the original one that came with the house. 

Thanks to Charles, we discovered that we purchased the wrong thermostat for our system. He also showed us how the airflow worked and explained how to regulate the temperatures for each floor. We really appreciated him educating us on our system. 

Another plus is that their technicians are not working on commission so there's no pressuring you to about additional repairs or even services that you may be able to do yourself. 

Rudy Cools cools will definitely be our resource for any HVAC needs in the future.",1

trn_4073,"I think this spot must have lost its Mojo.  There are only a handful of flavors to choose from and none of them stood out.  All but two of those flavors were fat-free, but we'd never have know if we didn't ask.  You'd think it would be posted along with the flavor.  There's also a very serious lack of toppings at this location compared to some of the others.

I already hate that the yogurt is always soft at these self-serve yogurt places, but it was really bad at this Mojo.  When my girlfriend pulled the lever for the chocolate it came out very soupy.  The girl at the counter told her that it always comes out that way.  If that's the case, the manager should probably look into getting that machine fixed. 

On the plus side, the sample cups are left up front, so it's easy to test a flavor without having to ask.  The storefront is set up nicely considering it's so small.  If you're looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth, and happen to be in City North, then Mojo is an alright place to stop into.  But I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat at this Mojo.",-1

Luckily I didn't have to experience any line-ups and I found myself standing over glass and looking down at what you call gelato- it looked beautiful! There wasn't a lot of selection at the time, and many of the flavours I could not pronounce or come to any grasp as to what they were. The staff was kind and helped me pick out what I wanted. I got the 'small' and it was pretty small, nothing generous and pricey too.

I sat in their somewhat small, clean and shiny place in front of a flat screen TV and really enjoyed my mango and coffee flavour goodness.

The gelato was very good and not too sweet. However, it wasn't anything outstanding for the price.",0

It was alright not horrible.  We had a large group, my food was warm-coldish when I got it, disappointed in that. 

-They do not take reservations, BUT, if you download the 'no wait' app you can put your name in as soon as you are within 25+ miles of the place.  So that helps.

-Inside is cool, all fat head related attire.  Id like to have them actually offer a tour like great lakes does.

-Food was not bad, similar to cheesecake factory menu, and MELT portions.  

-I had the  Triple Bypass Burger ($13, not 9.99 like YELP menu states)  It was ok, you tasted more burger meat than anything else, burger wasn't seasoned 

-Service- very good

Not 5/5 because:
-Prices a little steep, thought for selling their own beer, they would be cheaper
-Food was warm/cold, burger was ok, not enough flavor
-No reservations

Id go here again to give it another shot before calling it quits.",0
trn_4080,"I had an awful experience tonight in my attempt to take my best friend to watch this show. It's actually interesting how fervently I feel about my negativity regarding this show based on our experience with one of the supposed-calls-himself-a-performer ""performers"" (who is more like a glorified man-handling asshole) before we were even able to WATCH the show. But alas, I digress. 

In my efforts to throw a banging bachelorette weekend for my bestie, I booked us tickets to watch back-to-back male revues (one for tonight and another for tomorrow night). We arrived to the 11:00 PM showing of this show approximately half an hour before its start. As various performers were signing autographs for audience members of the previous show, we noticed that the time was getting closer to 11:00, yet we were not being let in to be seated. Finally, 11:00 comes, and all the performers except one (who is the star of this story, so stay tuned!) enter the show area behind the locked doors. We are then left wondering with two other audience goers when we would be let in.

Meanwhile, the one sole ""performer"" left behind decided to play up the gaggle of girls still awestruck by the performance they had witnessed. When I say play up, I mean reveling in the experience of having these women attempt to lift his shirt and feel him up. His actions were short of getting ready to take the group home. But, that's his prerogative. At this point, however, it is 11:20 PM and we have not been let in. The doors are still locked, and nobody is giving us a status update, nor is anyone around to ask for help. Interestingly, he had talked and was trying to be cute with the other two show-goers waiting for the 11:00 PM show. Those girls then came to us to let us know that the guy was really pushing to exchange phone numbers with them to help ""fix the issue."" Whatever the hell that means to him is up for interpretation.

As this asshole strolls past my friend and me acting like he's a Greek god himself (and trust me when I say he's aesthetically the least attractive of them all), he not-so-subtly checks her out as if he is undressing her with his eyes, going to the extent of biting his lip and shaking his head. Professionalism at its finest, right? Nonetheless, I politely ask him what the status was of the show. He tells us that he got some email saying the show has been cancelled. I ask him how I can go about getting a refund, in which he states that it'd be better if he just let me attend the show the following day. I told him that I had already scheduled the Chippendales show for us, which conflicts with their show. 

So, what does this supposed performer tell us to do? He tells us to ""fuck off!"" and walk away, ignoring our questions to at least identifying a manager or person that could assist us in the matter. He then went on this rant about how we ""expected him to fix our problem, yet we would consider his show to even be on level with Chippendales?"" he asked incredulously, before stomping off in a huff not unlike that of a toddler.

At this point, I'm dealing with trying to get a refund for this show, but that is not why I'm writing this review. From a broader perspective, it makes you think about the individuals participating in this show. If they sincerely feel like they are the best, then show it. Put on your game face, get your shit together, and create amazing performances that would persuade those seeking out a good old Vegas time to never even consider another male revue. Competition is good for encouraging you to better yourself. If all you have going for yourself is a six pack of abs and an accent, Lord knows that you won't have that forever. Moreover, if that is ALL you have going for yourself, I sincerely pity you. It's unfortunate that your coworkers have to deal with your sorry attitude on a regular basis, and I truly empathize with them in that regard. 

Note: The photo I've attached to this review is the photo of said performer. We found a picture of him from another reviewer about the show. Have a field day! :)",-1
trn_4081,"So I had read about Patties Express and was trying to pick a good day to go check it out. Also I thought it was located right in the heart of one of the academic jungles in Toronto known as Ryserson campus and not really wanting to traverse my way through throngs of campus denizens, I just never made it here... until a couple of weeks ago.
I was walking from west to east along elm street trying to look for a much raved about Chinese bakery/cafe in the vicinity when I came across this place.
Being hungry and having wanted to try something here, I just decided to look for the bakery another day. The man who takes care of the curry colored pockets makes the customer feel welcomed. I had a medium spicy Curry Chicken one on the first trip which tasted alright even though I ate only after sometime. Then yesterday as well, I came back here after getting some baked goods and this time decided to get the patty and coco bread sandwich. I picked the medium spicy Beef one, and the same guy from the first trip was here and he placed one that was coming hot out of the oven into the bread. That patty was so warm wedged up between the slice of fluffy coco bread. Yeah, I'll have to let it sit for abit next time so that the filling is allowed to set and will not ooze out like molten lava.
And I like the texture of the pastry at Patties Express, it's firm and not crumbly so when I bite into it the pasty does not flake all over.
The price is pretty reasonable and  it's decent for a comforting hand-held snack to eat whole walking and see what's happening along downtown Yonge Street.
And like I said on another review. I'll be coming here if I don't want to go all the way to Kensington Market to enjoy a nice, soothing patty.
Both times I've been at this place after 3pm and there isn't a line up to get one which makes me glad :-)",1
trn_4082,"OK, we tried a couple of $14 beers, bleu cheese truffled chips, the calamari, the salmon dinner, the braised short rib tortellini, the creme brulee, and chocolate filled chocolate beignets.  The bleu cheese chips are very heavy on the bleu cheese, so if you like bleu cheese, these are great ... if you are a marginal fan of bleu cheese, then the chips are still pretty good.  The calamari was good and the sauce was good, but I like mine a litter crispier.  The salmon was very tasty with potatoes and asparagus, but I would have liked more sauce.  The tortellini was also tasty but a bit al dente for our taste.  The desserts were awesome.  We dropped nearly $170 plus tip for that meal, so be prepared.  I would suggest trying Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace for I think better food and about the same spendiness, if you only want to splurge once.",1
trn_4083,We haven't been here since they moved to the Belmont location. It was great though and we have missed it! We had a great server (Marin) and enjoyed ourselves. The Greek salad was very good and the kids loved the pizza.,1
trn_4084,"It's a Starbucks, what more can you expect? The location is decent, inside the Westin hotel and it only gets crowded in the morning hours. There is comfy seating, you can also take your drink over to the bar area on the first floor or sit at one of the slot machines.",0
trn_4085,Yum! COOG-an-amman-tastic!,1
trn_4086,"Found this place on Yelp while in Phoenix on business, decided to give it a try for lunch. I was,at least initially, a little put off by the REALLY long line. I'm NOT a guy that waits at restaurants. If I can't get in right away, I'll come back some other time. When I'm hungry, I'm hungry NOW, and if I have to wait, I just get hungrier and increasingly grumpy. I'm just weird like that. But, for whatever reason, my coworker and I said what the heck, we're here, let's check it out and see what all the fuss is about. I mean, with a line that long, there's got to be something pretty good going on in there, right?

So we get in the line, which is probably 40 or 50 people deep. Luckily, the line is under a covered patio area, complete with misting devices to relieve the heat, and they're playing some old school country-- lots of Waylon and Willie and the like. This is a huge plus for me. When my dad and I would go fishing when I was a kid, back in the 70's, he only had 3 eight-track tapes in his car, and they were Waylon, Willie, and Kristofferson. It was a long drive, so I'd learned all those songs by heart before I was nine years old.  But I digress.

So the line moves VERY SLOWLY, which is normally something that would tick me off and I'd leave after about 5 minutes. But for some reason, maybe the smell, we stayed. For over an hour. And I wasn't even pissed, which is really, really weird. At some point, you cross a line where it's like ""we've been here THIS long, we may as well wait it out or it was all for nothing."" So we stayed, and stayed, and stayed. 

The good tunes continued, and a nice lady, who was the owner's sister I think, came around and passed out complimentary bottles of water, which was nice. And then...disaster struck.

After an hour in line, the owner comes out and says they're fresh out of brisket (the signature dish) and ribs, but there will still be pulled pork, sausage, and turkey.

Dude.  Now I'm getting pissed.  

But we stay, because we'd already been there for so long. And I can't get THAT pissed, because honestly, if this guy's business is doing so well that people stand in line for hours at lunchtime and he sells out of his wares, then God bless him, that's truly frickin' awesome. 

Finally, we make it in the door. It's not impressive at all in there, which is part of its charm. It's small. There's a counter where you order, and 4, maybe 5, small tables, pretty close together. And of course they're full. Your best bet here is get your food to go, or go sit outside on the patio,where there are some picnic tables. Your odds of getting a table inside during lunch are pretty long, so don't go there with that in mind. Consider it a fortuitous turn of events if it happens.

We got turkey, sausage, and pulled pork, plus the cheese grits and the beans as sides. And even though they weren't the signature dish, they were amazing. Seriously. Listen, I'm a fat dude from the south that travels extensively for a living, and loves to stuff my face, and I've had BBQ in every small town in Texas, and all over Louisiana, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas (not crazy about the Carolina BBQ, but that's just me). This was top notch BBQ, folks.

So we resolved to go back the next day, a lot earlier, so we could get the brisket. And we did. We got there at 10:30am. The place opens at 11.  There was already a line when we got there, and we waited for over an hour AGAIN. Seriously. But I was on a mission. I was getting some damn brisket, one way or another. And I did.

Best. Brisket. EVER.  Seriously.  Every bit as good as anything you'll get at any BBQ competition in Texas.  And, it turns out, that's because the owner used to do BBQ competitions in Texas. And win them.  Now it's all making sense! 

Dude... are you still reading this? I mean, it's really, really, long. 

Anyway, the brisket melts in your mouth, and it's incredibly flavorful. You have to have some.  Really.  You must. 

So here's what you need to know:  They open at 11, and they sell until they sell out. If you want the brisket (and you do, trust me), you get there by 10:30 or 10:45, or they'll sell out before you get to the front of the line. You're going to wait a LONG time. Be ready for that, there's no way around it. You're going to want to get it to go, or sit outside at the picnic tables under the patio, because there are 4 or 5 small tables inside and a bazillion people there, so you do the math. We ate outside. It's kinda fun because the picnic tables are by the people in line, and they're all drooling over your food, and you can tell them how amazing it is, maybe even make a lot of exaggerated yummy sounds and BBQ ecstasy faces, just to irk them a little bit more. If, you know, you're that kind of person, and I'm not suggesting that you are.  I mean, you might be. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

So anyway, that's the review. Go there. Eat the brisket. It rocks.",1
trn_4087,"We went because of the many reviews and it was near the hotel where our friends were staying. Pleasantly surprised by the pretty interior and our table had a wonderful view of the pool & shark tank. 

None of us had starters but a basket of bread was brought to the table along with some olive oil. NOTHING special about the bread-it could have came from Smith's or Albertson's... 

I had the Cannelloni (17.99) which was stuffed with chicken and spinach, with béchamel and marinara sauce. The plate was served with 2 cannellonis which were delicious. My husband had the Filet alla Griglia (34.99), a center-cut filet with Italian roasted potatoes and asparagus topped witha rich Borolo demi-glace. He enjoyed every bite & said the asparagus was cooked perfectly!. One friend had the Fettuccine alla Campagnola(17.99) which had chicken, mushrooms, peas, mozzarella in a sugo rosa sauce. She said it was very good. Our other friend had the Rigatoni della Sansoni (18.99) which had a meat sauce and is normally topped with homemade meatballs but our friend asked if italian sausage could be substituted instead , which they did with no hesitation or extra charge. 

The staff was very pleasant & attentive without being intrusive. 

That said, I can only give this restaurant 3/5 stars.  There is no way we would go out of our way to eat here again given all of the italian eateries in town and given the price, nothing we tasted was ""out of this world"" and portions were very small and only a few of the pricier entrees came with sides (albeit very small portioned sides).",0

trn_4096,"A group of friends and I visited Las Vegas last weekend, and we had a WONDERFUL experience with Strip Trips!! Our fearless leaders, Brittany and James, planned everything out and made everything we did hassle-free.  We walked down Fremont Street, acted like kids and played games, went to the most exclusive bars and clubs in numerous different casinos/hotels, had a cabana at a pool party, took so many priceless photos, met new friends, and rode in an OPEN-BAR party limo and bus almost EVERYWHERE we went!  People say you can't see all of Vegas in one weekend, but we made it happen!  This is the best option if you are having a bachelor/bachelorette or birthday party!  It is also great if you just want to have an amazing time without the stress of planning everything.  

If you book with Strip Trips in advance, almost everything is included so you don't have to worry about spending a ton of money the weekend of the trip.  I felt like a VIP at every single place  we went!  We were on the list at every bar/club/pool party, which means we got to skip the line and walk right in (free).  The people in line seemed to be very jealous of our connections ;-)  This weekend was definitely one for the books!  Party buses, dance offs, clubs, pool parties, gambling, exclusive (off the menu) drinks, chandeliers, beautiful sights, new friends, laughing until it hurt, dune buggies, and SO much more!  I recommend Strip Trips to anyone and everyone.  Thank you, Brittany and James, for this unforgettable experience.",1
trn_4097,"I wanted to share my incredible experience with two highly intelligent and empathetic people.  My grandmother died this week and to be fair, she was my favorite relative.  After a week of what seems to be Murphy's Law at every turn, the unthinkable happened; I dropped my iPhone and the screen shattered.  Already feeling defeated and having to make a difficult journey the next morning I looked to my husband to help me fix my screen, it was 7:45pm and no Apple appointments were available for at least 2 days.  As tears streamed down my face some amazing employees really made my night their names are Joseph and Joshua at the Arrowhead Mall location in Glendale, AZ.  Sadly, no last names were given for these common names but I am forever grateful for their kindness, skill, and understanding.  They stayed after the store was closed to switch out my screens.

5/5 for the community friendliness, environment, cafe design, and atmosphere. 

3/5 for the inconsistent quality of coffee and food (and sometimes service). I live in the neighborhood and visit UB at least one a week. Based on the taste alone, I would never know if I was at the same coffee shop. One example is the hot Mocha. At best, it doesn't taste like chocolate at all; at worst it's like drinking cardboard dissolved in water. Please UB management, test out a new mocha espresso recipe.",1

trn_4102,"It's been at least thirty years since I last went to a drive in, so when my friends suggested catching a movie here I thought they were a little crazy. But sure, I like a new experience and thought it might be worth a giggle. We caught the new Men In Black 3 movie.

I have to admit - this was an AWESOME idea. It turned out to be a whole lot of fun! The movie was easy to see and it was neat to be able to talk to folks during the movie without disturbing other patrons. Plus if you're a smoker, it's cool. And you can bring your dog! (What if your dog is a smoker? I'm not sure.)

A couple of tips...
- Check weather.com to see when the sun sets. The movie starts just after that.
- Arrive early. You will want to make sure you get a good spot.
- Bring lawn chairs! This can be more comfortable than sitting in the car.
- My Android phone has an FM radio receiver. The soundtrack is broadcast over a low power FM transmitter so I was able to use my headphones and not have to hear any of the other noises. Why don't ""normal"" movie theaters do this??
- The line for the concession stand gets long just before the movie starts. So if you're getting stuff, get it as soon as you arrive.

While it's super easy to smuggle in your own food and drink, it's not a nice thing to do. They have a concession stand here with the usual stuff - candy, popcorn, nachos, hot dogs, cotton candy - and the prices are surprisingly reasonable. The concession stand is what keeps the place open. If you're going to smuggle anything, bring your flask to make your ""Coke"" into something more adult. But buy the soda here!

Current price is $5 per person. They don't seem to be offering a ""per car"" price any more.",1
trn_4103,"Good dim sum, not too expensive, out in Mississauga but worth the trip. 

Our family spent many Sunday brunches here and I always love going with a big group so we can order a larger variety.

I think it's consistently good, not consistently great but good and clean and busy which means the food is usually fresh. When I lived in Taipei we would never eat anywhere where there wasn't a wait because that meant the food usually sat around. Which is a policy I usually stick to for Chinese Restaurants. 

I'm giving it 4 stars mainly because if I want dim sum in Toronto it's usually the place I think of first. But really maybe it should be 3.5?

Not sure about the service or non-dim sum menu so this review is just for dim sum.

I like anything with bbq pork, especially the bbq pork wrapped in thin sheets of rice noodle, and baked bbq pork buns. I also love the rice noodles with a side of xo sauce, wrapped sticky rice, Chinese broccoli and deep fried sticky rice ball with sesame or red bean paste and egg tarts for dessert.

Not sure how useful these descriptions are because I only know the Chinese names so I'm describing the dishes... sorry but if you've been to dim sum before you might be able to figure it out. Next time I go I'll try to update the names.",1

Even though I picked up the car at the Executive Inn location, I needed to return it to the airport, which was easily arranged for a small additional fee. Return to the airport was also quick and efficient. 

I have rented vehicles with other rental companies in the past, and will be happy to return to Avis in the future if this is the customer service I can expect.

Great job Avis. Thank you!",1
trn_4109,"Great place for tapas! I really enjoy this restaurant for a couple reasons. 1 being that they change the menu constantly and 2 being that each item on the menu is always good. Some are better than others, but the worst thing on their menu is good.

I love going with 2 or 3 other people so we can order a variety of things and I can try new and different kinds of food. Sol Y Sombra is always a nice change of pace from other Scottsdale eateries. 

Nice cocktail and wine list also.",1
trn_4110,Great burgers - the default is a double. Lots of fresh cut fries - portions are huge - a regular size fry will feed two people. The onion rings are amazing - very crispy and huge. Well worth the price. Convenient ordering system online to save waiting at the restaurant if you are picking up food - definitely recommend using this feature on their site.,1
trn_4111,I've been getting my teeth cleaned here for the past 3 years. I highly recommend this office. The staff is extremely friendly. I've also received confirmation from my orthodontist that the staff is doing a great job on cleaning my teeth. Their services have helped prevent me from getting cavities.,1
trn_4112,"The Dr himself seems fine & very thorough as mentioned in other review. He was a professor before he practiced which I thought was very different & seemed beneficial to his bed side manor. However the staff is what drove us out. The wait was an HOUR past the appointment time. The total wait time was 1 hour & 15 minutes to get to examination room. The wait in the examination room was 10 minutes. The Dr visit was fine. He asked plenty of good questions did examination & as I said was thorough. Then we were put to wait an additional 15 minute wait on the staff to get blood work paperwork & I went to front desk to ask what the hold up was & the one competent staff member I met was schooling another staff member on how to list vitals... WOW!!!! So we left on that note. 
Side note: I was there to take my Mom & she had been to this Dr before & said it wasn't like this in the years past. So it is 100% staffing issues. So unfortunate that he's good Dr surrounded by bad staff.",-1
trn_4113,Krystal was pretty cool i guess... she did forget my appetizer but was apologetic and compensating....my food was ok but i got a message from a fellow yelper to give this place another try ..the a.c. was on so i wasnt dying in sweat and after my expeirience today i might go back maybe.........,-1

trn_4115,"We went for dinner before a show and were expecting an awesome dinner. Upon arriving we were very impressed by the cute decor and how busy the restaurant was, however things went downhill very quickly. We waited at least 15 minutes before our waiter came to take or order, and judging by the speediness of the staff we placed our drink appetizer and entree orders all at once. Luckily the waitstaff in charge of water came around to fill our waters at least five times. We waited another 15 minutes before our appetizers came (missing one we ordered) and another 5 before our beverages arrived (missing one we ordered, yet again). The wine ordered came in strange ""mouthwash"" glasses that were hot...yes...HOT. When we notified our waiter of the missing orders he apologized and ran off yet again. Finally, nearly 45 minutes after we ordered our entrees the food finally came...and with all the built up anticipation fell completely flat. The scallops were sandy, the chicken was dryer than the saltine challenge and the bolognese and curry chicken unremarkable. Portions are tiny and served in a manner that would suggest dining at a much nicer establishment. I had high hopes for this place but it was sorely lacking in service and quality for the price. Maybe if they spent more time working on service and less time hand stamping their menus with honeysalt logos I would have enjoyed it more. Might try in three months but I would stay away for now...",-1

trn_4123,"I got tickets to a show on the phone. I didn't pay much attention when the agent said that she'll have to read a disclosure and then started talking fast for 2 minutes, but i probably should have for my own good - because when i went to the place to pick up the tickets the guy there without much discussion, just made a copy of my credit card and saved it in his file. 

I discussed this with his manager later and apparently it is legal and he also assured me that the info will be kept safe and later securely shredded but i still think there are much better ways to do it. And their prices weren't much different from other full price sellers. Lets just say I'm not a fan....",-1
trn_4124,"We went there quite a few times, at first with our daughter, even celebrating her 11th birthday there! 

Food was original, very tasty and the place itself was pretty darn cool!

Sadly, they got their alcohol permit and kids are not allowed anymore. My daughter is very sad because they had an awesome sunday bar!

Still, i appreciate their food and still love the ambiance!",1
trn_4125,"I enjoyed my first dinner here.  While I do like most of Toby Keith's songs, and even went to one of his concerts at The Pearl, neither circumstance has any bearing on my rating of his namesake restaurant.  I rate a restaurant on the quality of its food, service, and ambiance--nothing more and nothing less.  Based solely on those criteria, I enjoyed the whole experience here.

When our order was taken we had only one hour remaining before a ticketed show.  Hearing this, our waitress, Felicia M., did a great job getting the food out to us in a timely fashion, and later quickly presenting us with our bill, so that we had enough time to eat before hastening off to The Quad next door.            

I began with Fried Pickles, which were interesting warm lengths of pickle encased in slightly salty beer batter, that proved to be quite tasty dipped in an intriguing Southwest Ranch Dressing or joined with a few dollops of ketchup.  A Dinner Salad composed chiefly of Romaine Lettuce, cut tomato pieces, and a very smooth and mellow Honey Mustard Dressing was a nice prelude to my entree of moist and toothsome Homemade Honky Tonk Meatloaf with rich dark Brown Gravy that was accompanied by good skin-on Mashed Potatoes and creamy Coleslaw.  Buttered Cornbread rounded out a fine meal, which was enhanced by piped in country rock music which gave way to live country rock music by a small band at 9:00 p.m. sharp.   

I will be back to try the highly vaunted Fried Bologna Sandwich with Miracle Whip on Texas Toast!",1
trn_4126,"The show was as expected- partially nude glistening men. The drinks were great and surprisingly affordable. A perfect night for those bachelorettes. 

Two stars because the young ""lady"" who took our tickets at the door had a terrible attitude. It didn't ruin our night, I put the incident behind me and waited to vent on Yelp :) We asked if we had a table-she snorted that the whole theater was tables- very helpful, thanks. The attitude and comments continued for a few minutes until another woman escorted us away from her.
 
I get it, she deals with rather annoying women on a nightly basis. But it's expected- don't apply for the job! Since this is Vegas and there are other male shows I will recommend others because of her. Too bad because those men really work it hard to have a greeter tarnish their review.",-1
trn_4127,"Did a nice job re-soling & re-heeling my old Frye Boots.  It wasn't cheap but they did a solid job.  Also love the crazy guys that own that place.  What are they? Israeli or something?  They should have a reality show, they are CRAZY.",1

trn_4129,"Bluebird Kitchen is a decent place to stop and eat at if you are downtown and want to grab something quick and healthy. Everything is pre-made and al la carte. The only downside is their selection is pretty small and since everything is pre-made you can't omit or add anything. Their house made potato chips are some of the best chips I've had. 
They do have an awesome selection of desserts. 
If you're not already downtown I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here. Parking downtown is too much of a pain.",0
trn_4130,"The roasted pork special was really amazing. We also ordered a traditional combination plate with an enchilada and taco and it was delicious. I like that this restaurant offers many of the Americanized favorite Mexican dishes, however, they taste authentic with the heat and real chilis!",1
trn_4131,"Worst korean bbq I have ever eaten!
Ever since the new owners replaced Chingu, the place has been a mess.
Waitress could not speak english and she did not ask her other coworkers to help translate, nor did any of the other waitresses bother to help until we finally managed to flag someone else down.
Only half of the grilling meats on the menu were delivered to our table. And the ones that did, you could clearly tell they were still frozen/half frozen.
The chicken was mushy, the squid was still frozen solid and the pork belly was sliced badly (the thickness was like the thickness of a chocolate bar) and they were not mariniated.
We came here on a Saturday evening, you would think they would be prepared!!
Extremely disappointed and would never come back.",-1

I always find clothes I love here but I also found all sorts of cute things for my new apartment here (which is hard cause I'm kind of picky) and this is pretty much always where I go first to find gifts for friends.

trn_4138,Good Gumbo. Good deal on clams. Love the sauteed alligator. Good happy hours,1
trn_4139,"I gave this place 4 stars, NOT because I think it's some great fancy Italian Eatery but because they go for the low cost - fast casual Italian dining option, and at that standard I feel that they successfully live up to it.    I feel if you want a pasta, pizza, or Italian salad for under $10 and dinner in just a few minutes this is a place that you can't go wrong. 

The service is alright, again it's fast casual so I hold them to a standard slightly above fast food so I am putting the bar relatively low.   

Check it out for a quick option for dinner if you want to avoid fast food and have hit the nearby Panera too much recently.",1
trn_4140,I'm pretty sure this is what heaven tastes like. I've never been a big fan of crepes before- but this place has made me a convert. Specifically a raw sugar and butter crepe has stolen my heart forever. The wait can be a little daunting and it can be a little hard to find seating- it's in a narrow indoor pathway between Paris and Bally's casino. You'll wait a little bit to order. You'll wait a little bit to find a seat. You'll wait even longer to hear your name called- and then you'll forget all about the wait when you taste the crepes.,1

On top of that, they continue to broadcast videos of naked Japanese men in bathhouses on the wall, making for a really uncomfortable and strange experience.

trn_4145,"This mainstay has been at the corner of Saxonburg and Rte 8 since at least 2002; it's a pretty good place to get your Chinese buffet fill, and it's also supercheap ($~6 for lunch buffet) - with that said the food is your typical Chinese fare in Pittsburgh, but it's also the only Chinese restaurant for miles around.",1
trn_4146,"The reason Essence of Life gets 5 stars is not because it's posh, lush, or has every single item I could ever need (altho I haven't checked that yet).  It's because it's prices are SO FREAKIN GOOD!

I feel like an idiot for spending so much at the Big Carrot, Whole Foods, and Loblaws when I could just come here and get all my house and personal products here.  My girlfriend told me that the Diva cup is $10 cheaper than elsewhere!  My Gioavanni shampoo is $6.99 instead of $9.99.  All the products we use are significantly cheaper here.  How do they do that?

If Honest Ed's could own an organic shop, this would be the place (altho, without the huge, sprawled out chaos).",1
trn_4147,"I was not a fan of Hardee's at all! The advertisements are what dragged us in with the hopes of a huge, quality burger as advertised, but we got mediocre food at best. I got the curly fries, chili dog (~$5.99 combo) and the chicken tenders (~$9.99). The chicken tenders were chewy and did not taste or look as though they were ""hand breaded."" I didn't like the honey mustard dipping sauce. It had a heavy taste of Dijon mustard and a hint of horseradish. The curly fries were not good and didn't compare to other fast food curly fries. The hot dog was salty, cheap tasting and the chili on it was over processed and looked like dog food. The staff was friendly and the wait wasn't long, so nothing but positives there, but I would not be visiting Hardee's again due to the lack of taste for the prices we paid.",-1
trn_4148,"This place is okay as a sushi restaurant, it's nothing special, though it doesn't have many character flaws either. It's got nice ambience, and the service is relatively good. The staff isn't particularly attentive, but really, at what sushi restaurant is it?

The sushi was alright, nothing spectacular. Although I would recommend getting the Sunshine Roll if you drop by.

I mostly tried the sushi, as that's what I went for, but the other items on the menu looked really good, so I'm definitely going to try them the next time I go.

The food was reasonably priced. Will definitely be coming back.",1

It's clean, well-lit and has great customer service. Sure you can go somewhere cheaper but this is definitely a you-get-what-you-pay-for place. The machines are huge and there's plenty of them. The place is kept very clean and they even have a small area for the kids to play in if you're into that.",1

The feeling of rock and roll pervades the space yet the attitude of staff and students is respectful, kind, energetic. When music is in your soul, it shouldn't be a painful extraction process to let it out...and School of Rock understands this. They get students directly to the fun part right away and give them confidence to explore their passion while still instilling work ethic, practice and technique. My 10 year old loves it and so do I. So happy we found it!",1

I had a conference to attend here and was lucky enough to get to stay in the same building. Conference space had 4-5 floors with spacious rooms for workshops and sessions. Yardbird is here and the casino is always busy and lively. I enjoyed my room even though my view of the strip was of the parking blocked with other buildings - if i knew i wouldn't see much, I would've gone for the cheaper room facing in towards the pretty pool. The only inconvenience about this place was due to the fact that it was too big. It took 3 elevators for me to be home everytime and definitely at least a 10-minute walk from the lobby, through 3 elevators and then my room. Would totally stay here again for personal and business travels.",1
trn_4154,"Located in The new shopping district of Summerlin...Public School 702 makes it's home in Downtown Summerlin. A very modern and hip restaurant at that, themed after school/education like atmosphere. Everything from their menus to decorations sets the place off right. This huge place located on the second floor also has an outdoor balcony area that almost rivals the inside seating of course depending on weather. This casual yet up beat restaurant provides quick and friendly service by their staff who are also dressed casual. Not quite sure, we came on a weekend and noticed a weekend menu...so there might be a separate weekday one as well. They also have happy hour which they call recess which plays to the theme. Menu choices were kinda small but quality and choices were there. It is a bar and grill brewery type of restaurant so expect the usual burgers and custom beers and alcohol. Choices of even Lamb and Bison burgers which were tender, juicy and mouthwatering delicious. Still Public School 702 is family and kid friendly & very refreshing. As casual as it is, it still gives you that classy feeling with fun elegance. Prices are average and maybe slightly a little more for casual dining...but service and ambience make up for it as well as the food. Definitely recommend this place, at least to try out once or twice if you are in the area or after a long day shopping in Downtown Summerlin.",1
trn_4155,This is a truly excellent doctor but his office needs major help. The doctor really cares about his patient and wants to help but the office is poorly runned. Plus he's so booked its very difficult to get an appointment and they never answer the phone. The only reason I got in to see him was because I was very sick and another doctor I was seeing called to get me in to see him. Otherwise I would have had to wait months to see the doctor.

trn_4158,"I've been coming here for years since I worked at my second real estate office, C-21 MW, 2000-ish, (which used to be located nearby)- how come it's taken me so long to write a review?!

Our most recent visit was a few weeks ago, when we used my promotional Birthday Gift, the iconic Messy Sundae (ooey-gooey caramel and fudge topped vanilla ice cream with walnuts and whipped topping; it's one of my fave desserts of all time---yeah, it's that good). It was a saturday and was way before the lunch rush. So, it was quiet, until the large family who kept asking for ""gluten-free"" this & that arrived (Oh, I'm sure that their server was annoyed. Ok, maybe they weren't as annoying as the family who complained about the salads being ""way too big"" and thus their bill was adjusted, ahem; that was on another past visit). We got a different pizza this time (we've tried five different ones total, over the years), and had the truffle fries (to-die-for romano cheese-topped goodness). Our son loved the fries. He's kind of a picky eater, meaning, he won't eat it if he doesn't like it, picky. 
 
Service is always good. The bathroom is always clean. The rest of the restaurant grounds/main dining area, is always clean. If you can brave it, it's cold right now, there is seating outside, in the front. There is a bar part, too (separate---and yes, you guessed it, I've been to that part, too, years ago, though). And Happy Hour too. The food is solid--- from the pizzas, and must mention that the mini kobe beef burgers are really yummy, too. The salads are really good, too (I wouldn't be complaining about how big they are, either, hahaha).

It's christmas time, and there's a gift card promotion (Buy $50, Bonus $10 certificate), so why not get some christmas shopping done here, too? Grab a bite, try the kobe minis, along with a pizza, and get the messy sundae. Sounds like a plan. 

Also has a few other locations: centennial, flamingo (9516), rainbow/215, and green valley, too.",1

trn_4160,"This came up on my search for consignment shops in North Carolina. It's next to TCBY - parking can be a challenge if you are going to park close to the store, but there is a garage. (I've been lucky to find parking near the shop.)

It's a well curated store with a range of brands from small boutique ones to the bigger names like LV and Chanel. Everything is on racks by size for ease of shopping. Tops seem to be on the left front of the store, dresses and skirts are opposite, sale is the far right, and shoes, pants/jeans, and atheleisure in the far back left.

Pricing is fair and all of the items are marked with what the price will drop to based on certain dates. (This depends on how long the item has been at the shop.) Condition on clothing and accessories is very good - nothing seems to be in rough shape.

I have not made a purchase yet, but they have a good selection and it's a pleasant space to walk through. Everyone who has worked there when I've gone is polite and happy to answer your questions.",1

In addition to the broken dispenser, we also watched the gentlemen at the counter missing using the counter and wasting additional time. Once at the counter, we asked if there was a convention, which we were told there was and we asked if it was a surprise for them but were told that this was like this for them every day until it got hot...

trn_4164,"I really like this hotel and there are many reasons why. 

1. Rooms are an excellent size with plenty of space to move around and stretch out if you're 2 or more and of course it's a plus if you're alone. The bed is quite comfy with decent pillows. The toilet is separate from the main bath area which I appreciate and there's a nice window ledge wide enough to put luggage. Shopping bags or anything else you may need to prop up. There's also a decent closer to hang your clothes. The bathroom is bright with a good shower and they have pretty good amenities included. The room also include a couch, a desk and a mini fridge for your food and beverages. There's also a microwave to warm things up. 

2. This hotel has a pretty good Happy Hour every day from 2-6 pm. I've had the beer, the wine, the wings and the house made chips and everything is delicious!! I really enjoy the wings! I ask for them well done and the kitchen staff does a really good job. They also come out nice and hot just covered in sauce. They have a handful of items on the happy hour menu and I'm sure they are all good. 

3. The buffet breakfast in the morning is included and it's pretty good. I've tried many things and I have been very satisfied with the choices. Items include: eggs, turkey sausage, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, cheese, and a wide selection of breads, muffins and croissants and they also have coffee, tea, juice and hot chocolate. They also have peanut butter, jams and Nutella in mini to go packs. They also have quite a bit of seating available for everyone to enjoy.

3. Lastly, all staff have always been friendly and helpful here. They also have a shuttle bus that drops you to the strip and Fashion Show Mall.  I believe the bus runs every hour. The hotel itself is just behind the strip and it's easy to find. It's close to the convention centre. There's also a 24hr convenience store locates just beside for all your treats and a shopping plaza on the other side about 10 minutes walking. 

If you book your Las Vegas trip at this hotel I am sure you won't be disappointed",1
trn_4165,I've only had the crepes here but there are lots of other good looking things on the menu. The crepes are the best in town. So good! And the owners are so nice and welcoming. Great customer service here! If I could come here everyday I would. Jealous of those who live nearby. I live across town and make the trip out here on the weekends just for these crepes.,1
trn_4166,"By far the BEST massage place I've ever been to!!! I discovered this place a little over a year ago and I absolutely love it and will never go anywhere else. They are professional, clean, and have a great VIP rewards program with awesome incentives. I always see LISA. She's such an amazing masseuse! She always takes care of every inch of my body and is extremely good at what she does. I highly recommend Sam's Spa, if ever you're in need of a relaxing and satisfying massage.",1

Everyone working there looks like they're having a great time, which is really important. Having everything fried in duck fat makes it taste really good.  Definitely a place to try!",1
trn_4168,"I'm writing this as an update to my last review.  Since my last update,  they brought back karaoke and the drink specials, for which I am happy and grateful. They have also allowed smoking on the back patio again. The bar is still bland, however,  and the only thing on the menu that excites me are the fish tacos. They are the bar tender's personal recipe (kudos to the owners for putting an employee's recipe on the menu) and fantastic.  The wings are also rather good with fries but thats about it. This place still feels like its rolling further and further downhill and I can't help but to think the owners didn't know what they were doing when they bought it. I was there this past Sunday and spent the evening with a whole 6 people,  3 of which came with me and one I believe worked there but was off the clock. Rumor has it that this place won't survive a few more months and that saddens me but its not the same place it was as RTOs and probably shouldn't stick around.  Hopefully whatever goes there next is more successful and better managed. 

PS.: Calling Restaurant Impossible like another person said is actually a good idea. Maybe try it.",-1
trn_4169,sometimes you just want to go to an old fashioned country style restaraunt and order some biscuits n gravy and don't need all the over the top fixins some of the other places put (hint hint: snooze putting carrots in their gravy realllllyyyyy?!?!?!?!) in their dishes. the place serves generous size portions and I am a fan!,1

trn_4171,"The food truck came to my workplace. I feel like they came unprepared. We waited in line for 15 - 20 minutes and still no one was there to take our orders. A few people just gave up and got cup of noodles from a vending machine instead. 

I really like chicken and waffles in general but their chicken and waffles are just okay. The butter is on the waffles so they got soggy pretty quick. The chicken was tender. It's definitely not worth waiting for 15-20 minutes plus to get the food. 

I would still prefer chicken and waffles from Skinny Fats to this place if I'm in vegas; otherwise, I would vote for roscoes in LA.",0

Let alone the rude delivery driver, the food was wrong, they put several toppings that I did not want on my pizza and also they forgot napkins and forks and they even forgot to bring out Mac & Cheese balls.
I also called to advise them and they told me they don't care and they will not fix the order nor will they refunded my money, I will never in my life go to this place again and I hope anyone else who wants to eat here does not

We had ran into some people in front of the ticket booth trying to sell what may have been tickets, not really sure as I wasn't biting that line. I walked up to the ticket counter and brought it to the attention of management who then called security and had it handled. Come to find out the tickets weren't legit.

I was not impressed with any of the food to be honest (except the steamed buns). The presentation is nice but the flavors were not so much. The ramen was super funky to me reminiscent of dirty water. I really wanted to love this place but it wasn't for me. Idk if I would go back given the $13 entree price.",0
trn_4190,"We have a ""win""ner...for the best value for lunch specials. Of course, you can't go wrong with the fish ball with shark bone noodle soup, which is their specialty.

Oh, in terms of that? Not bad at all! The fish balls were definitely homemade and some of the best I've had. The shark bone soup probably could've done with a bit more flavour, as it didn't really taste much different from your normal chicken soup. The noodles were standard.

I also liked how the noodle soup came with fried fish skin, though the problem was it wasn't mentioned in the menu. We ordered a second fried fish skin batch without realizing our order initially came with it! Better communication there, folks.

Service was blah at best, but that's typical of Chinese restaurants. I'll come back for the fish ball noodle soup, but not sure if any other food there is worth trying out.",0

trn_4199,"Incredible food, amazing value, horrendous service. 


Let's start with the good. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon to grab some lunch. We were seated quickly and got our menus right away. We ordered the Lalibela Platter for Two, which came with a mixture of vegetarian and meat dishes. When the food arrived, all the negative was forgotten as the flavours ""dance"" on your palate. 

For $26 dollars, the dish was also of incredible value. The Platter came with eight different dishes and was served with two injeras. We could not finish the fold and more than half of it was taken home. 

Now let's move on to the bad. The concept of service does not exist in this restaurant. At one point, we were the only customers inside and the waitress still did not seem to bat an eye at our requests. After we got our menus, it took at least 25 minutes to get her attention and order the platter. The food took at least 30 minutes to arrive. Afterwards, it was another 30 minutes to get the bill. When asked to split the bill, the waitress entered it in the machine and left--leaving me to complete the rest of the transaction by myself (good thing I have POS experience). When we asked for a takeout box, we waited another 20 minutes. If you have three hours to spare on a meal, go ahead and waste it here.

I will be returning for the amazing value and the food, but I'll make sure to leave any expectations of customer service out the door.",0
trn_4200,"I actually wondered for a while what was up with this store - I mean really, what is a Home Economist?  Do you get your own personal Alan Greenspan?  And yes, I have been a resident of Charlotte long enough to remember that was the name of the place before they changed it.

Really I cannot say if Healthy Home Market is all that much better name-wise, but at least you do not expect some stiff coming over to invade your place.

The store itself is not much to look at.  Or be inside.  And the parking lot is only decent if you compare it to the one outside the Asian Corners.  As has been mentioned many times, the South Boulevard version is vastly superior in just about every respect, yet the new location near the Matthews Wal-Mart is strangely modeled after this store, being on the small side.  So obviously they think there is something for it.

As to the inside, it is actually a cool little space.  It is strangely reminiscent of a grocery you might find in the downtown of a large city, with stuff crammed everywhere - though the product is decidedly funky, and you can get all sorts of things you might not find at most places.  Many spices available by the ounce/pound/whatever weight you choose, and oils and honeys as well.

I would also echo that they are excruciatingly slow, but it is definitely worth a peek if you want something out of the ordinary.",0
trn_4201,The service is fantastic. John is the best and the bacon wrapped dates are delicious. Add an albino stout and it's a perfect evening.,1
trn_4202,This is the slowest Wendy's I have been to in a while.  The people working here are friendly enough but they just can't keep up with demand.  There has to be something they aren't doing that other Wendy's manage to get done quickly.,-1
trn_4203,This was our first time here and won't be our last. I had the Turkey Monterey Panini and it was loaded with Turkey. The sauce/spread was tangy and delicious along with the peppers and mushrooms. My son had the burger which he said was juicy and seasoned well. We will definitely be back to try more!,1
trn_4204,"What a great place to have dinner. The chicken breast is so juicy and delicious and the rice is amazing! Very nice atmosphere and the employees are very nice! They have lunch specials which are very affordable. There food fills you right up and I usually can't finish my food in one sitting. 

The only negative side is that they always forget to give us our drinks, forks, knives, napkins and sometimes water. Its annoying to have to get up and ask for everything. 

Other then that I would TOTALLY recommend this place it is delicious",1
trn_4205,Food was great! I was looking for a place I could easily eat at close to the airport (I'm vegan) and this place popped up! Happy to see it was pretty busy on a Thursday night and it was across from my old school (QAA)! I never knew this place was in that strip mall! Service was slow and I questioned how much they understood what vegan was (I swear the vegetable soup had chicken broth) but they made me a delicious coconut milk curry and amazing rice dish!,1
trn_4206,"The only dish that I like from Hush is their fish and chips, besides that nothing really stood out. The customer service was very poor...our waitress never refilled our water and never followed up with us regarding the food. They stood around near the bar area (first floor) and chatted.
The interior of the restaurant is classy and spectacular.",0
trn_4207,"This is my new guilty pleasure when I have the chance to work from home in Ballantyne during the week. I tried the original restaurant at this location and found the food lacking, so when I saw the ""Under new management"" banner and new name a few months back, I hopefully popped back in looking for something different - and Hyderabadi Biryani House is definitely different, and delicious!

They've got the best buffet I've found in Charlotte. In addition to your typical, ever-present Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Tikka, they occasionally include some special treats like Samosas, Samosa Chaat, vegetarian Tikka Masala and more. (And I'm serious, if you hook me up with a Samosa during your buffet hours, I'm a fan for life!)

There are also all sorts of other dishes that I've not ever seen on other buffets in the area, including frequent appearances of Gulab Jamun (honey soaked dough/donut type dessert).

I like that they use plastic wrap in the huge pans to cut down on the volume of food in some of them, so that the rice, or the little pancakes are fresh, presented in smaller portions so they don't get stale. 

The food items are all labelled, but I'd appreciate perhaps a short 2-5 word description of some of the more unique or unfamiliar items. I discovered Indian food in my early 20's in the DC area, so I thought I'd tried a variety of dishes, but they always have some items on the table that stump me, and I'm not the sort to try new things when I eat out on my own. I require peer pressure to be adventurous, apparently. I've been guilty of taking out my phone after my first trip to the buffet and Googling the names of some of the unfamiliar dishes to learn more about them! 

All of the dishes I've tried are tasty and the choices are varied and plentiful, though the buffet versions of my favorite dishes seem a little bland. I think this is typical of Indian buffets, as dishes that aren't cooked to order need to appeal to a wider range of palates.  Still, the buffet is tasty enough to warrant filling up over lunch! I haven't ordered off the menu yet, because I have a habit of craving Indian food during my lunch hour so I'm always getting the buffet. I'd really like to try their Chicken Tikka Masala cooked to order sometime, to see if it's a little spicier.

I often get here right after they open, and I'm in and out in 20-30 minutes tops, with at least 2 trips up to the buffet. Service is exceptionally fast and friendly, and the restaurant fills up quickly at lunch. When I'm by myself, I deliberately try to avoid staring at my phone during my meal, because I have such a soft spot in my heart for tasty Indian food and I believe it should be experienced and appreciated, without focusing on something else!

The owners running this restaurant appear to be very engaged and friendly, and they seem to be doing a lot to build up a great business, including building a new banquet hall. It's refreshing to see a restaurant with owners who care so much about getting the food right. I'll be back for many more visits (both solo, and with anyone I can drag along with me) in the future!",1
trn_4208,"The bibimbap is mind blowing.  I had never heard of it or knew what it was and went solely on Yelp reviews and ordered it.  I ordered and extra sauce to mix in and it made it perfect.  The side dishes were sub par but it didn't matter bc the entree was so good.  What a perfect addition to the park road shopping center!  The environment is really nice so you could go for a date night, girls night, etc.  the service was really good as well!  I wish the prices were a tad bit cheaper.",1

trn_4210,"I eat here regularly because I work in the parking lot. We do have tons of choices nearby but I still eat here more than the other places in our lot. Mainly because I have so many favorites on the menu that it makes it tough to get old. I usually call in my order then walk over. 

This is not my favorite robertoes and definitely not the most consistent location. 

The main reason they get 3 stars is because it is a total gamble that my food comes as ordered, I bet it comes right about 65% of the time. When it comes wrong it is still good though, just not as I ordered it. For example, I like to order a #4 no rice extra beans in it's place... They mess that up a lot. Or chorizo burrito add potato add cheese, also commonly botched. They have never messed up my carne asada burrito tho...

All in all, good food at a good price. Quick and tasty in a valley of terrible Mexican food. Try not to customize your order. And do yourself a favor and grab some of the free jalapeño soaked carrots at the salsa station!",0

trn_4225,"One of my worst experiences ever.  Food was OK.  Not great, not bad.  Very stereotypical of the type of restaurant.  My problem lies with the staff.  No one we tried to speak to spoke English.  We just got a lot of head nodding no matter what we asked.  There was a table of loud twenty-somethings.  They were so loud people on the other side of the restaurant could hear them, kept looking their way and shaking their heads.  This is a large establishment.  No one came over and asked them to quiet down.  They were so loud (I was about 3 tables away) I could not hear what my dinner partner was saying.  I got up, went to the hostess (whose English was better than anyone else's) and asked to see the manager.  All I received was a blank stare.  I asked three times.  Nothing.  I sat back down, and the rude table only got louder.  I finally got up and went over to the table myself.  This only made them even more rude.  I went back up to the buffet to get some food, turned around and the leader of the bunch was literally in my face telling me I'm a bitch and if I touch him he will call the police.  I backed up, (remember, he invaded my space) and started yelling, hoping management would now come out.  STILL NOTHING!  I won't eat where management does not have a backbone if a customer is being threatened.  I'm a very small woman.  I'm the only one who stood up against these people.  There were large men in the restaurant.  No one.  People thanked me.  No one helped.  Where was management?",-1

Specifically a raw sugar and butter crepe has stolen my heart forever. The wait can be a little daunting and it can be a little hard to find seating- it's in a narrow indoor pathway between Paris and Bally's casino. You'll wait a little bit to order. You'll wait a little bit to find a seat. You'll wait even longer to hear your name called- and then you'll forget all about the wait when you taste the crepes.,1
trn_4233,"Had reservation for small SUV. Told it would be 20mins, it was in the car wash. After 40 mins, they tell me there are no SUV's (wasnt it just in the car wash??) so I could get a mini-van or a sedan.  Ok, mini-van if I must.  Wait 20 mins please. Another 40 mins, I inquire. Manager goes to check on it. Nice man working offers me a free 2nd day but I only need the car for about 4 hours, so I ask for comp on gas, Ok he says.  25 mins later, I'm mad, go next door to Enterprise, they have SUV's.  Go see if I can cancel and get refund...now the mini-vans ready. Nice man is now off shift. I mention his gas offer to the manager, she looks at me like I'm outta my mind, tells me I already was given an ""upgrade"" to the mini-van, I about lost it! I DONT WANT the mini-van, I WANT my reserved SUV, keep your ""upgrade""!! She says she will contact the man to see what we agreed on. I go to get the car, I see TWO Suv's there.  I ask the lovely lady at the key kiosk about them, she hooks me up into one of the SUV's quickly.  As I'm going to SUV the manager walks by, tells me she added the note about the free gas to my account and was nice.  I'm sure they all have heard alot of angry words, esp if this is the norm for them.  I feel bad for the employees here.
So, even though I received the SUV I had reserved, and got approval for free gas (we used so little the register barely moved) the waste of my time and the frustration of the event has me saying I would never use Advantage again.  Not to mention I was not the only one waiting or frustrated.  This was a Tuesday afternoon.  The rate was awesome, but I would have easily paid double next door at Enterprise (or any other) to not waste 2 hours of my precious Vegas time, especially since we rented the car specifically to drive to Red Rock Canyon to drive and walk a bit through that park.",-1
trn_4234,"Took my '10 Tacoma over there earlier. Not a sophisticated looking place. Hot rods and classics all around. No lasers - all old school. Cash or check only. Also, no appointments. There's a clipboard you sign in on, and he does them in order (although he will call when done if you drop off).
Have to say that Gary is very thorough. He drives it, works on it, drives it again to double-check, and tweaks it if it isn't just perfect. The Taco definitely seems to be aligned correctly, and drives good.  
Read other reviews that say he seems like he ignores you.  True, he stays focused on his work and isn't much of a talker, but I think the clipboard is his version of automated check-in.  He's not real pricey either.- which is getting rare nowadays. 
I highly recommend Gary's!",1

trn_4236,"How fabulous to have such a fantastic place open late at night. Most food late night is fast food. Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired. I ordered it because I had never heard of it and it was great. Two thumbs up and my first visit to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. If/when we are in MGM I plan on eating here again.",1
trn_4237,I used to go to the Bikkuri on king street quite often and really liked the sushi there. So the name stuck with me and when this place opened a few years ago I was happy there was another location. However the food wasn't great when I tried it before. The sushi wasn't great quality and there was a lot of rice. Yesterday I ordered take out from here because I was on the area and decided to give it another try to see if things improved. It hasn't. We ordered the sushi for two dinner and a salmon teriyaki. The sushi has a bit nicer presentation but the fish is sliced very thin and there is a lot of rice. Some of the fish seems not fresh. The salmon teriyaki was a good portion but the sides was two pieces of broccoli and two pieces of carrots. Based on my most recent experience not sure if I would come back for take out. Overall not memorable place for sushi takeout.,-1

The restaurant is beautifully appointed and the service was quite good.

The extensive menu offers a little something for everyone and I love how you can try so many different tastes during your dinner.",1

trn_4244,"A little pricey, and the quality and service was not there to match.

Had the filet sandwich was very much overcooked (you could not request how you wanted it cooked), the beef was not at all tender, probably because it was over cooked.

The pizza was OK and the salad was great!

There wine bar looked interesting but I am not sure I will be back.",-1
trn_4245,"Not sure if we got rip off by a Half Off ticket booth in Planet Hollywood, but $180 for 4 is steep for what we witnessed.  

I guess I was expecting top talent for Vegas.  I been here about 6 years ago with super funny comedians with Gary Valentine headlining. That's what I expect for this entertainment capital of the world.  But this time was pretty poor.   Sure I laughed more than my share, but you can tell the level was bottom rung.   I been on two carnival cruises recently and they were Vegas quality. 

The place hasn't been updated in probably 20 years. I don't mind as much but let's get real talent or lower your prices. I always have my local improv if I want to take my chances. 

Thank you for reading",-1
trn_4246,"This is my local.  It's the closest thing you can find to a cozy English pub in the area, and it fills that role well.  

This is a place where you can can rub shoulders with rowdy students, unwinding professionals, artsy types, tourists, old folks, possibly underage neighbourhood kids....  

There's always a comforting ""bar buzz"" here, with suitably depresssing lighting, lots of eye candy to keep you occupied if eavesdropping doesn't, and best of all, NO TVs!  

The food is unspectacular sub-par pub fare, although I've actually had decent brunches here.  Also munch-worthy is the poutine (not on the menu).  

Contrary to some reviews, the beer is surprisingly cheap, if you resist the import-urge and stick with the house domestics on draft.  

The only downside is that high staff turnover means the service is spotty (so you'll never get that ""Cheers"" vibe here).  Personally, I think that just adds to the charm and hilarity (let's not forget this is a place called the ""The Village Idiot  - L'Idiot du Village"")",1
trn_4247,"Me and my boyfriend came here for the first time for 4th of July lunch. I have to say...Out of this world food and service. We have been to many top rated places while visiting here in Vegas but this place was by far our favorite. The prices are affordable and the portion sizes are huge. The food was so flavorful we just wanted to keep eating. Our server, Nick (sheriff of flavor town) was awesome! He gave us some great recommendations and made our experience here even better. We are already planning on coming back for dinner.",1
trn_4248,"My experience with this company was dissapointing. My carpets did look clean but that's because I had to pay for add ons to shampoo it. The person who came told me ""it's like washing your hair with no shampoo, is your hair gonna be clean just by adding water?""  Gross. So why do you sell carpet cleaning services if your price doesn't include the cleaning part? Anyhow, to have 3 rooms + the staircase ""cleaned"" I ended up paying over $150.00. P.s. I went with this company because of the glowing reviews. Nothing special. This service done back on July 2015.

In response to Hydrocare's comment:
That's the best ""sorry not sorry""comment I've ever seen. If I go get an oil change I expect my car to get an oil change. Not get a car wash. Like I said, I didn't appreciate the guy telling me if you want your carpets clean then you have to pay to shampoo them. So you should advertise your service as ""getting your carpets wet"". I'm just a consumer leaving my two cents. Congratulations on your fantastic reviews.",-1

I'm not a first time car buyer but my husband is.  We had been searching for a decent Elantra for a while by that point, and coming up short all over the place.  First car was a hologram car, used solely as a bait and switch, next four were beat up beyond their price tags, and we even considered going back to the Nissan Altima, despite mine having a total engine failure not too long ago.  But I was dead set on the Elantra, so we just kept looking and looking.  

Prior to going to this lot, we had found two cars that met our requirements(Elantra, Low mileage, Less than $10k) that were said to be on the lot.  We'd printed out their ads and carried them in my MAMMOTH purse.  As soon as we got on the lot, we were greeted by Cole, who let us meander the lot and talk to ourselves about the various cars.  We sat down and outlined our requirements for him and let him know we wanted to see no more than 3 cars.  He disappeared for a bit, but came back with one car that met all of our requirements.  As my hubby and I looked at it, we got out the paper and it was indeed one of the cars we were after from this dealership.  So we took her on a spin.  It was a pleasure to drive that car after all the crappy Elantras we had been driving.  So we sat down to talk it through.  My husband and Cole went back and forth on price until it was within reason for us, and we shook on it.  My husband made this contingent with the manager on our mechanic giving the Elantra a clean bill of health and we were told that the dealership would fix anything that was a less than $500 repair.  

After a fair bit of time (though in dealership terms for a Saturday, not all that bad), we spoke with Tim in finance.  Tim was amazing.  He said that he took so long because he was getting the bank sweet talked into a lower interest rate.  He spoke with us about our financial state and gave us some really valuable credit advice.  What impressed me most was him saying, ""I'm only partially concerned about this car.  I'm MORE concerned about your next purchase.  Let's get your credit to a place where that next purchase can happen.""  

As to the car, she got a PERFECT bill of health from our mechanic, except she needs a new timing belt and water pump as a preventative.  It's a $400 repair and as soon as my husband called, they said they'd clear it with the boss man (Bill) and schedule service.  If they don't, we'll just bill it to our warranty program.  All told, we really had a great experience car buying at San Tan Hyundai.",1

I forget the young woman's name at the front desk but she worked there Thursday and Friday, she was personable and very enjoyable to talk with.  The breakfast was just what we like waffle eggs and fruit which tasted good.  The other thing we really enjoyed was Seymour who works at the hotel.  At breakfast he walked around and welcomed the customers and asked if they needed anything.  He was fun to talk with and was full of fun experiences.  He also had many ideas on what to do around the area if you needed help.  He made us feel very welcomed and comfortable.  He made are stay top notch.  The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and quiet.  We will stay there next time we go to Scottsdale.",1
trn_4257,"Why does Amazon.com continue to contract with this company?  They are destroying the Amazon.com brand one delivery at a time.  Whenever I get notice of an Amazon delivery via OnTrac I know that it will be late, and there is a 50% chance they will miss the promised DAY.  On a number of occasions they have reported delivering a package  at a time earlier than actual delivery,  Really, a delivery update hits my email at 8:30 PM and you think I didn't notice it wasn't delivered at the reported time of 4:00pm? a few occasions packages have arrived well after 8:00.  In one instance the package arrived after 11:00pm.  

I am not surprised by the review saying OnTrac drivers have twice the stops of FedEx or UPS or USPS.  All the more reason why this company should be avoided by anyone who needs reliable timely delivery.  All the more reason Amazon.com should kill their contract with OnTrack.

trn_4259,"Rather than do multiple reviews for each location i visited during my week there, I'm just going to lump the experience on one review.

Holy crap. the blocks are big. One city block to Vegas is 17 to most normal cities. And i thought everything was supposed to be bigger in Texas.

Wow. The fountains at the Bellagio are everything the movies made them out to be. 
The rest of Vegas, however, isn't.

I felt like I was being attacked w/ tourist money stealing ninja moves the entire time I was there.

We stayed at the New York, New York. The radio station f*d up our room reservation, so the manager upgraded us to a room w/ a hot tub in it at no charge to us. (woo)  The rest of New York, New York however is not so cool.  I didnt realize you could take a ""theme"" that far..

Mandalay bay was my favorite of the casinos inside, seemed less full of itself than a lot of the others. The bartenders were good there, and the whole vibe of the crowd was much more chill there. 

Excalibur ...what, am I 12?
The Mirage...kinda cool..
MGM.....geez ...it's huge. Kinda ok, my one and only ""big"" win here. $200 on a slot I chose cause of the colors, lol.
San Remo; old, dirty, in the middle of a remodel and the only casion that felt ""movie Vegas"" to me. Cheap, huge, tasty prime rib dinner, fun slots, and a really lively crowd at the tables. My favorite for the experience.

We did a lot of other stuff, there was a cab driver strike while we were there, did a few shows,...but overall the entire experience would NOT have been worth a week if I was paying for it. 

I'll go again, but it will be for a weekend, or for a certain show, or just to spend more time in 'old town', or visit my tat art buddy and finally get the custom art done......but that's about it.",-1

trn_4263,"Ok, it's not the fanciest place, but I have to say it's a lot of bang for the buck. $16.00 buys a kid all day unlimited rides and use of the jungle gym. We took a friends kids here and had a day out for under 40 dollars. They had a blast.
    I might have rated it a little higher if the place was kept up better. The first thing I noticed was the carpeting was bunched up in several places. Not a trip hazard, but unsightly. I noticed that only some rides were going at any one time. The attendants would run one for a while then move to another. Not enough attendants to run all at once. The jungle gym was huge compared to others. One of the kids said ""it's bigger than the one at Peter Piper"". The thought did cross my mind, how clean is it in there? Some of the games use quarters and some use tokens. They should standardize to all tokens.
   As far as the food, you might do well to avoid ordering food there. We ordered pizza fries. They took 15 minutes to get. The fries were soggy and bland as they were nothing more than fries with melted cheese and pepperoni.

We all ordered soups. My mandu soup was delicious. My son's seafood soup was also delicious but some of the clams did not open up so they could not be eaten. Wife's soup good also. The service was friendly but food delivery not ideal. My soup was delivered first, and a few minutes later my son's. I was half finished with my meal when my wife's food was finally delivered.

About an hour and 15 minutes later the buzzer went off earlier than expected- which we thought was delightful. However the hostess accidentally somehow buzzed everyone on the list and there was a giant queue of confused people. They fixed the error rather quickly and we were told there is another 25 minute wait. So we just kind of stood around the bar and the buzzer went off- but at least i know why they always fighting at cheese cake!! ( please ignore lame attempt to make a drake reference).

I tried the stuffed cheeseburger and it was delicious with chedder oozing out the middle and also started off with the spring roll platter that came with a choice of salmon, chicken, avacado and ground beef spring rolls with different dipping sauces. They were all good. Unfortunately i had loaded up on beer while waiting for so long that i had no room for cheesecake at the cheesecake factory.

trn_4273,"Oh, Bonterra. I wish I made more money and could eat your food every day. 

This beautiful restaurant, located in an old church, is definitely one of Charlotte's best. I've been there twice - once during restaurant week and once with my dad and boyfriend. Restaurant week was great - I had the soup of the day (a carrot something, it was divine) and the mahi-mahi (also amazing), and a peach tart (good). Didn't think that meal could get much better, until my second visit.

We started off with a bottle of Malbec. Solid. The wine list is extensive but pretty pricey. We shared the tomato basil dip (a little too whipped for my taste, but the guys loved it), some olives, and proscuitto. The house-baked bread, prepared fresh every day, is fabulous. 

I had the Arctic Char with risotto and mole sauce. To be honest, I was a little wary. Mole with char? I thought it would be too heavy or overwhelming. Instead, it was amazing. The char was perfectly cooked with a little crust on the outside. And OMG the mole. Oh that mole will be in my dreams. My dad had the ribeye and loved it; my boyfriend had the veal porterhouse and enjoyed it, as well. We were stuffed, but split the creme brulee for dessert which was, you guessed it, pretty darn good.

That char, though...man oh man, get yourself to Bonterra now.",1

trn_4292,"Go see Francis in the Golden Nugget's men's restroom located near the 24 carat club. (I'm being specific because most of the knuckle heads in that place don't have a freaking clue when you ask where to find the shoe shine guy). With over 30 yrs experience, he's a great individual who takes immense pride in his work. He only charges a few bucks for dress shoes, but he did such a wonderful job, I tipped him well. I recommend you do the same. He'll reward you with the biggest smile and gratitude you'll ever get in Las Vegas.

*If you've ever got your shoes shined @ Nordstroms you can really appreciate the work that this man does! I only make it out to Vegas a few times a year, but I wait to get my shoes shined by Francis rather than wasting my time and money going anywhere else!*",1

trn_4294,"Luna's is one of my favorite places to grab healthy food in Charlotte. It's located in Southend. They serve healthy raw vegan food that is absolutely delicious; even if you're a meat lover.

*organic farmers, *seasonal produce, *family-owned farms, *organic, *living food, *plant-based cuisine

I love their coconut milk lattes. They are rich, creamy, and full of flavor!

I've been there several times. I usually go with their arugula harvest salad. The salad has arugula, red cabbage, spriralized root vegtables, avocado, pear, caramelized pecans, pumpkin seeds, raisins, homade cashew basil cheese (The cashew basil cheese literally tastes like legit cheese!) and maple mustard vinaigrette. I like to have falafel added on top. Their salads are giant, which I love, because they fill you up all day. The vegetables are always fresh and ripe. 

I also like their tree of life juice. I'm obsessed with the jars that their juices come in. I like to keep them for to-go drinks and around the house. I usually drink their juices before a race.

They had a new item on the menu, sweet potato sushi! It had red bell peppers, cucumbers and arugula wrapped with sweet potato rice and nori leaves and garnished with a lightly spiced Thai chili sauce. I highly recommend these too! 

Their whole grain vegan bread with almond butter is also a delicious side in the morning with their coffee. 

Their collard green wrapped quinoa burgers are also a great option!

Another favorite of mine is the Lunasagna. It has layers of tender, crisp zucchini noodles, cahsew basil cheese, sun-dried tomato sauce and mushrooms. It's also served with a side salad. The Lunasagna was really good and I didn't think I'd like it because it was cold, but it was perfect!

Ive also ordered the avocado and basil sandwich. It was filled with fresh organic slices of avocado, tomato, onion, sprouts, basil, homemade lemon parsley hummus and cashew sour cream wrapped up in a collard green. You have the choice of vegan multigrain bread or collard greens. I like the collard greens because they are thick and strong; they don't fall apart like iceberg lettuce wraps. For my side, I had their broccoli Waldorf salad. It consisted of diced broccoli, green apple, celery, walnuts, raisin, red onions, homemade chasew mayonnaise, and lemon juice. I don't know how they do it because it didn't taste vegan. I felt like I was eating a summer broccoli waldorf salad drenched in mayonnaise. I'm so impressed. 

I love Luna's atmosphere, their staff is very friendly and helpful, and the service is quick! I can't wait to try more on the menu!",1

trn_4296,"Must say everyone at this location was super friendly and very helpful. I was picked up by Aaron and was brought to the branch. They were very limited in the selections of cars. They had 1 small car, 1 huge truck and a mini van. My reservation was for a full-size vehicle which they obviously didn't have. Ty (branch mgr) and Aaron was going to give me the van for no extra charge for a day or two as I waited for another vehicle to switch with or until I was able to speak to the third party insurance company paying for my rental. I decided to take the small car as I didn't need anything big like the van or the F150 truck they had. Plus, I didn't want to have a gas hustler. Long story short, I called the next morning to see if they got any cars I could exchange with as the one I had was way too small for the two car seats I needed. Unfortunately, they didn't. Ty and Tony (asst mgr) helped me by contacting another branch and arranging my Switch. I had no issues at all. They worked with me and ensured I didn't leave without a vehicle. Way to go guys! 

Docking one star for the limited amount of vehicles available only.",1
trn_4297,The team work in this place is amazing. Everyone works together so well.  Our sushi was very very good. The best we've had. The service was very quick! We're definitely going back with friends next time. The only thing I wasn't impressed with is the ice tea wasn't very good.,1
trn_4298,"I was looking for a spot to drink and watch the NCAA tournament before the Jimmy Buffett concert at the Grand Garden Arena.  Level Up was the only only bar that wasn't packed so that is where I ended up.  It was off to a good start when I sat at the bar and they had several Jimmy Buffett themed cocktails.  I picked one and waited for a bartender to be available.  It took quite awhile considering the ratio of bartenders to customers but I wasn't in a hurry so didn't sweat it.  I ordered my drink and asked to run a tab, he said ok but didn't run a tab.  Again, no biggie I can pay as I go.  There was a contest on the cocktail menu if you ordered the Jimmy Buffett drink you were entered to win tickets and hotel stay when he is back in October.  I asked how to enter the contest and he didn't know.  Ummm Ok.  I probably wasn't going to win anyway.  Now I have finished my drink and put my glass at the edge hoping one of the bartenders will notice.  No one did.  I finally flagged one down and got another round.  By now I am over it.  I finish my drink and leave.  Drinks were ok, not great and not worth the hassle.  Drinks were overpriced like everywhere on the strip.  I am used to and don't mind that.",-1
trn_4299,"I come here every Thursday with my family for Team Trivia (they also have trivia on Saturday) and the staff makes us feel at home.  Our favorite server is Gina, she is very friendly and always accomadating.  Their menu is very impressive for a sports bar.  They have numeruous specialty burgers (which can be served on their fantastic pretzel bun!) as well as an extensive selection of sandwiches. My favorite burger is their pesto turkey burger, it has great flavor and the basil mayo is delicious! They also have several items not normally found in a sports bar like their grilled salmon dinner or fish and chips.  I've also had fajitas there when they were on special and they were quite tasty.

The layout of the bar features a misted, fenced in patio with tables and hightops where you can smoke while enjoying your cocktails and food. Inside there is a host station to your left or you can just seat yourself at the bar or at one of the 12 or so hightops surronding it. To the left of the bar is the ""restaurant"" area if you will. It's seperated by a partition wall and two large screen tvs. There are about 10 tables in this section as well as a larger table tucked in the back that could comfortably hold 8 people. There are tvs galore in this  place. All of them high definition and large screen. There really isn't a bad seat in the house when it comes to watching a sporting event. One of my favorite things about this place is that they have a couch set up in back infront of two of their televisions, if you get here early enough during football season snag it! It's like sitting in your living room watching the games yet someone is serving you cold beers and delicious food. The only time you have to get up is too pee. Legit.

I have never attended but I hear they have bingo nights as well as poker tournaments here. There are also dartboards as well as a golden tee machine. Free wifi as well, just ask your server for the password.",1
trn_4300,"Wow. I ate the best omlet of my life here. The eggs were so light and fluffy and fresh. The vegetables were crisp and the avocado guac mix inside was to die for. Thank you, Yelp, for guiding me to the ultimate Sunday Funday brunch in Phoenix. I loved that the atmosphere was so casual. You felt like you were in a famiily's back yard (if their back yard was big and beautiful and filled with goodies. I loved that it was dog friendly. What dog wouldn't want to chill on a patio in the fresh air and maybe get a few scraps of bacon. The Bloody Mary was so fresh and had a good kick to it. We also got an order of the Monte Cristo. Woah. Insanely big slice of fluffy french toast w/ syrup, ham and an egg. I want to go back! I am a huge fan!",1
trn_4301,"I'm definitely going here again. The cucumber water was refreshing as a start. However, the strawberry lemonade could have had a little bit of sugar. My friend's spaghetti and ""meatball"" had a little kick to it, which brings out a burst of flavor. However, the ""meatball"" aka eggplant was a little dry. I had the spinach and artichoke flatbread and it was really good. I kind of wish the spinach was less dry. As a side for my flatbread, the waitress recommended, fingerling potatoes and it was phenomenal!! I savored every bite. Last, but not least the Ice Cream Sandwich. Overall, it was delicious but I wished that the cookie was warm and soft to melt the ice cream, so that the dessert melts in my mouth. If they can make these change, it would have been a perfect meal! I'll be looking forward trying other things on the menu next time I come here!",1
trn_4302,"I'm a big fan of this place. It's great to find a gem, where the prices are truly worth what you're getting! You have great gourmet meals at just a decent price tag in the 20s. I have had the Paprikash soup, which is rich, creamy and delicious. I have had both the beef short rib dish and the seafood pasta, both are items I can't steer away from when I go there.

I was a huge fan of the bone marrow appetizer special, but this is not for weak and weary. If you are not a fan of meat fat texture, this is not for you. Otherwise, for those who don't squirm at mushy, greasy deliciousness, GET IT. Your taste buds will thank you, while your arteries rebel.

Service has been very good the few times we have gone, with the wait staff being extremely knowledgeable of the menu and friendly.

I have seen their Monday/early bird prix fixe menu (3 courses for $22!), which is next on my list to try!",1
trn_4303,Really nice place. They are remodeling so it will look pretty cool soon. Everybody is friendly. Prices are reasonable. Kelly is a newbie and is still hourly but did a fantastic job with my hair and the owner came by several times to watch her progress and teach (as it should be). Great place. I will be coming back.,1
trn_4304,"This space is lovely. The food is terrible.

The shrimp ceviche bragged of avocado and jumbo shrimp. The shrimp might have started out jumbo, but they were cooked down to be the size of popcorn shrimp. They were tough and lacked any flavor. What once might have been a sliver of avocado was nothing more than greenish slime in the bottom of the bowl. This dish was mostly just acid sludge.

I also ordered the spinach salad. The first thing delivered was an arugula salad. I should have kept that. When the spinach salad came, it was overdressed (again, pure acid) so that the croutons were just soggy flatbread. 

I had a flight of wine. The Riesling was surprisingly good. Not too sweet. The Sav Blanc was vaguely reminiscent of warm swamp water.

Wishing I'd packed a kind bar in my bag. I won't come back to this place. I suggest you not either.",-1
trn_4305,"I've always wanted to try this place and last night I finally did.   My 3yr old son was demanding pizza and our options were limited in this area.   I, personally, have had it with cracker-crusts (aka Monicals, Jupiters, etc) and knew that a 3yr old and 7month old baby would not tolerate a 60minute wait for Papa Del's.  Jet's was a possibility, but they don't have indoor seating and we'd be relegated to eating pizza in the van.   So this is what came up on Yelp.   This pizza place is smack in between Seaboat and Jarlings.  So I knew if the pizza was a complete disaster, we'd at least have a good ice cream dessert afterwards!   Vinny's has a small/medium sized dining area.   They have a HUGE menu -- tons of pizza options (make your own, hawaiian, gyro, cheeseburger, mexican, BBQ chicken, and any other combination you can think of).  They have calzones, salads, appetizers, wings, slices (they roll out new slices every two hours and each day they pick about 10 different varieties to make).  The prices are reasonable.... we ordered a large supreme pizza (pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, peppers, onions), along with a bottle of rootbeer and an apple juice -- came to $22.   The pizza came out within about 10 minutes.   My toddler son was happy.   For NY style, it definitely wouldn't fly in NYC.  Not a chance.  But here, in Champaign.... it's not bad.   There's no char on the bottom of the pizza.... the crust is thin, chewy, crunchy and foldable.  The bottom is covered in cornmeal if I'm not mistaken....  The toppings were ok -- generous.   But past that.... it was ok.   I still think the best NY style pizza is Manalo's over by Krannert.  Nothing to write home about, but at least it wasn't a cracker crust!  And yes, we went over to Jarling's for dessert!",0
trn_4306,"Friend and I decided to try this place on a busy Saturday night since there was no wait time compared to the other Greek places.
Boyy was that a mistake! Restaurant was half full and we ordered chicken souvlaki's (w/ salad, rice, and potato). Service was really slow for all the customers nearby even though there's plenty of front staff. Took like 20 min for bread and another 20 for the salads. This is after the server checking up on us twice to ask if we received the salads yet. Chicken souvlaki dinner was bland. After our meals, we both felt a bit sick in the stomach and I felt like puking. Upon walking past the kitchen to the washroom, the cooks looked miserable...doesn't feel like the food is made with care here and will not be going back. 

Sometimes it's worth the wait at a good restaurant than try to satisfy your immediate hunger and risk the potential food poisoning. An hour after we felt okay so it's not a big deal. The staff seemed pretty courteous; still would not go back though.",-1

Stumbled upon this gem for the first time this past weekend, and I'm sure glad I did. The store is very clean, very well organized and the friendly staff is the cherry on top. There are lots of different styles to choose from across several decades, and the prices on everything are reasonable.

trn_4308,"It was great when I saw Dr Amy Sparks for the 1st time. Then I never saw her after because she is booked 6-8 months out so I always see the PA everytime. Imagine my surprise when I received a bill a year after that 1st visit. the annual physical is supposed to be free according to my UMR contract then they wrongfully charged me $100+ after a year. The most I should've been charged is the $14 copay. Patients are supposed to have 6 months to dispute but they will settle their bill with UMR a year after???what about the patients who cannot dispute??? I argued with them for weeks until they told me to just ignore it. Sparks family medicine is supposed to be part of the network according to our provider's website. I even confirmed with the clinic before I came in and they said yes but they charge patients! Now I just got another bill for a copay that I already paid for this year. Are they taking advantage of patients who will just pay and not check what they're entitled to??? that's it, I'm  switching doctors",-1
trn_4309,"I'm not one to give stars lightly.  

I was first introduced to Chino Bandido (or 'Chinos', as it's affectionately called by its regulars) by some friends of ours.  It was explained to me that it was a cross between Chinese food and Mexican food.  

I'm sure you might be saying 'Huh?' right about now.

Trust me on this one.  They have the most amazing burritos, quesadillas, and beans.  They have anywhere from very mild (teriyaki chicken) to really spicy (cuban black beans).  They have amazing fried rice and carnitas.  

It all comes together in what can only be described as an addicting concoction.  My stomach is grumbling as I write this ... just at the thought of this place.  They actually have die-hard regulars that have written poems and music about their food.  (Poems and music!)

Don't come here for the ambiance.  It's a hole in the wall.  Don't let that scare you.  Walk right up to the counter, tell them that you've never been there before, and prepare yourself to be taken on a tour of the food.  

Seriously -- they'll give you samples so you know what you like!

No, I'm not joking.

They have quite a lunch crowd during the week.  (For some reason, engineers just flock to this place).  Come either around 11:00 or after 1:00 to beat the lunch crowd.",1

trn_4314,"Ok first off the food was not cooked with any care. My daughter who was allergic to shrimp literally cried because the chef wasnt even skilled enough to cook it carefully on grill in front. So they made it in back and it literally took the whole meal for her to get it. She is 5 years old and loves hibachi. She cried simple as that. Now the food only thing was good was the scallops only because of the product not the cooking. My steak was over cooked i wanted rare to med rare came out med well nearly well. The chef joked like I was being sarcastic but it was bull literally bull caca. He wasnt funny, no volcanoe until i asked. No egg trick No sesame seeds again until i asked. He went to other chefs cart to get ingredients. This place blows and you will blow your hard earned cash. I am a chef myself. I have also worked in a kabuto but it was not this poorly ran or any degree near this. Not all kabutos suck but this was horrible. Get better chefs. The other 3-5 star reviews I am baffled that Charlotte thinks that it is quality hibachi? Read my reviews I have eatten hibachi all over.

You might think it odd, right? South Park seems like they would have a decent selection - but for whatever reason, theirs isn't very good. Monroe? Not good. Concord? Pineville? Not that great either.

But Northlake, for whatever reason, not only has excellent staff, they have an amazing selection - even for us big-bodied types. To make matters better, they offer some pretty amazing sales if you take the time to look for them (though those you can get at almost any location).",1

They don't open till 11AM, I get there at 9:30AM. I was the first in line and waited for an hour and a half. I was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else. Mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and I waited an hour and a half... and what happens? They do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog. They claim they are first come, first serve which is NOT true at all... False advertising and they really need to stick to what they say.

But we were hungry and decided to eat here anyway.

It's a tiny place.  There are perhaps 6 or 7 tables.  I would guess they could fit in maybe 20 people.  It's also divey.   Those are not bad things, just reporting what I saw.  If they ever get really busy you may not find a seat.

The host was friendly.  He doubled as a server. Authentic ambiance with the TV (in Spanish) and decor.  Reminded me of a couple of divey places I've been to in Mexico. 

I ordered the carne asada chimichanga.  Sort of my 'standard candle' by which I assess different Mexican joints.  My wife had the mole poblano (chicken).

The chimi had beans in it.  This surprised me.  Also the meat was not evenly distributed, so I got several bites that were just beans.  The flavor was OK. However, the mole poblano was really good.  I got to try my wife's.  The chicken by itself was bland, not marinated.  In fact we think it may have been boiled.  But the mole poblano sauce was truly outstanding. The rice was nothing special.  Not bad, but not particularly flavorful either.

So to recapitulate, the chimi was maybe 2.5 stars.  Not great, but not bad.  The rice was similarly about 2.5 stars.  The mole poblano was a solid four stars.  I think if the chicken had been grilled or fried that could have been a 5-star dish.  Overall I'm going with three stars.",0

trn_4324,"What I love about Fry's is that their prices are competitive compared to other grocery stores. I come to Fry's not necessarily for healthy food, but for the basics like peanut butter, bread, ingredients for a cake, milk, canned beans, etc.

Fry's App: Download the Fry's App, and create a shopping list, find exactly where your items are in which aisle, and don't spend extra time just roaming around the grocery store! The app shows the exact price of each item and what is in stock, too. Super useful and efficient for shopping. There's also a section for weekly ads that lists the specials for that week such as 10 artichokes for $10 with card.

When checking out, I usually give my phone number which doubles as the Alternate ID or VIP card. You can also add the scan to your Apple Wallet if you have an iPhone.

They also have a great wine selection! Wine at any grocery store excites me because back home in Oklahoma, you can only get liquor/wine at the liquor store.

They also removed the Beer of the Month special and it was 60 cent boneless wings night, but they make you get ten. They should let you get five and of course no dressing is included. They copied BWW exactly, no creativity. Well, the TV's are still great and the beer is still served icy and the mozzarella sticks at HH price were decent, so still a good place to catch a game.",1

My husband and I stopped in for appetizers and dessert no drinks and spent nearly $50.The food was mediocre and the service was poor!My husband and I decided to enjoy the cheesecake at home.Our server was unattentive until near the end of our meal. Deffinetley not a value.,-1

trn_4340,"A good place to stop by to get a bit buzzed before heading home.  Not too noisy, perfect place to share their giant goblet with your friend or friends.  You get a good amt of alcohol for the buck. It's like 9 shots in one.  We saw 4 guys sharing one goblet, hahaha, but it's Vegas.  Party as you please",1
trn_4341,"Came here for a quick getaway with my family.  Hotel is nice and modern..what you would expect of the Kimpton brand.  There is free coffee in the morning on the second floor.  This hotel is in the heart of downtown Phoenix and right next to the convention center, ball park and arena so during concerts and games, the area can get quite crowded.  Valet was I think $30ish/night which we did because self-parking was full when we came.",1

trn_4345,"We went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was empty aside from us and one other couple. Also, this place does not offer all you can eat sushi. This was a plus for me since I always think that the quality of the food is better in most cases. 

Spicy Bacon Tempura: This is one unique dish. I had bacon rolls before but not bacon tempura. What can I say? I love bacon and its flavor. I just did not like the oiliness of the dish. The bacon was fatty (I am not complaining!) and so frying it and putting batter around it made it a little too oily in my opinion. However, the sweet sauce that came with it balanced it out. I love anything sweet and salty.

Salmon Poke Tacos: The fish was fresh and the flavors were spot on. The fusion of the crunchy taco mixed with the mild Asian zing of the fish blend so well together. 

Salmon Rolls/Spicy Spider Rolls: The rolls that we tried all had wonderful flavors in it. The spider roll was just a regular spider roll. They were more than accommodating when I requested for it to be spicy. The rolls were fresh and the flavors were one of the best I've had. 

Grilled Salmon Bowl: One of my favorites yet! I love salmon and if you can cook salmon perfectly, I'm always sold on your establishment. The flavors were simple and yet extremely satisfying. The salmon was served with white rice and a side of sautéed mushroom and vegetables. It was cooked in a sweet sauce that blends well with the saltiness of the fish. One of the best salmon I had! I just inhaled that thing like crazy. The portion was a good amount. But because it was so good, it kept me wanting more.

What a wonderful find! This place is located near Skinnyfats on Durango. I've passed by this place so many times without realizing it. I highly recommend that you check out this place.",1
trn_4346,"Went last night, it was probably extra crowded because the June event had to be cancelled because of a storm.  Crowded is the operative word here, Rockwell Avenue was almost impassible and the East 21st Street and parking lot stands were just as bad.  No problems but I thought that they could have used a few more police/security.  There were so many (large, off leash) dogs that I wondered if we had wandered into a dog show.  Afterwards went back to Phusion Café on Superior Avenue to get a snack that we could eat in peace. 
 
Rockwell is so jammed with people, they should consider closing off the street all the way from East 21st to East 24th and only having stands on one side.",0
trn_4347,"Love this nail salon! Unlike others I have been to they talk to you in a friendly manner, they let you pick your pedicure from a list of prices ranging from 20 to 30. You have the option of hot stone foot and leg massage, paraffin dip, and different scrubs. They take their time doing your pedicure. Unlike other places where you wait an eternity and then the service takes 20 minutes. The nail techs in this shop are awesome. Will continue to go back every week.",1
trn_4348,"Started with soursop juice, which I had never had.  What a refreshing drink.  Tangy and sweet but not in an overwhelming way.

Had chicken stew for main, which hit the spot, along with the salbutes - kind of like a tostada, but more flavorful.

Family-owned and run.  Went in over Memorial Day weekend, so the place was quiet.  But I could see it getting busy on a regular weekend.  Nice experience - recommend giving it a try.",1
trn_4349,"Our waitress Lola was wonder helping us decide how to get exactly what we wanted from amazing menu unique menu choices.  Menu had eggs all over it not happy, but waitress and taste of food mde up for it.  They should was down menus before putting back in pile to give out.  

Ok lets get to the food. We order Incredible Omlette which was amazing. See pics.  Hot, fresh ingrediants and just as I ordered!  Service was quick and people around us were very friendly.",1
trn_4350,"I stopped here on the spur of the moment as I was headed to another restaurant.  I should have kept going.

After looking over the menu, I told the waitress I wanted a cup of hot and sour soup and an order of braised pork belly with preserved vegetables.  She gave me an odd look and then said, ""Those are dried vegetables.  They're not fresh vegetables.""  My response was, ""Yes?""  She then told me again they were not fresh vegetables and she added, ""I don't think you'll like that.  You should order something else.  We have fish and...."" and she gestured to other items on the separate, non-main menu.  I just got profiled because I'm not Asian.  I won't like it!!  I don't think she'll like this 1 star review!!!!

I looked over the menu some more and opted for the curry chicken.  In a short time, the curry chicken was brought.  Note that since I didn't say hot and sour soup a second time, it was left off the order.  In a few seconds, she brought the small bowl of rice.

They use plastic chopsticks and I have a difficult time with heavily sauced Chinese food and plastic.  I should have gone to the car where I always keep a pair of wooden chopsticks but I put the plastic ones down and started using my fork.  The server saw this and asked, ""Do you want a spoon?""  My answer was a quiet but firm, ""No!""  In a few moments she came to the table with a small plastic spoon that looked like a child's spoon.

The chicken was OK.  The sauce was heavy.  There should be more curry flavor.  This was my fourth time here (and last) and I have always gotten Singapore noodles and after the first time I've had to stress heavy on the curry.  That was my mistake this time.

I finished my meal, paid, crossed off the line for tip, signed the charge, and left.  

As you can tell, the service experience was awful.  But I would like this server to know that if she ever came to my restaurant, I wouldn't tell her she wouldn't like the scrapple.",-1
trn_4351,"This is a grand place in many ways; the lobby is pretty, the décor is over-the-top Disneyland, the shops are great, the choice of restaurants (which skew towards heavy foods) is good, and the rooms are big and comfortable. The room is probably the best reason to book here if you can get a room during the week for $175 or less. The room always smelled a bit funky when we first walked in though.. not sure. Maybe time to rip up the carpet.  But this property is crowded. And the crowds aren't exactly the fun type of Las Vegas people. Its like the show ""Jersey Shore"" invaded the place. And while I am sure the average person from the Garden State is enjoyable, this crowd is just too .. too. cheap and plastic. Gaming there is average strip gaming with a lot of slots and fun machines.",0

trn_4353,"Ideally, I would give this place 3.5 stars. The menu is filled with unique dishes such as butternut squash hummus, coal roasted cabbage and lobster avocado toast and has a strong focus on locally sourced ingredients. However, there's a certain ""je ne sais quois"" that is lacking. The ""smalls"" dishes are in the price range of $8-20 and are meant for sharing. My table ordered the following:

- Peppadew rellenos ($9)- tasty but nothing special 
- Charcuterie plate (with all the options- $35)- highly recommend, great assortment of meats (e.g. duck prosciutto) and cheeses
- Maine lobster mac & cheese ($20)- this dish used fettuccine noodles and was trying to be too gourmet- flavors did not go well together - prefer classic mac n' cheese topped with lobster 
- Pacific yellowtail crudo ($16)- four thin slices of tuna (no flavor), paired with bland crispy rice cakes and plated on top of a sriracha type sauce 

I really wanted to love Zeppelin's but some things need to change before I give it a second chance.",0

Food was not that good but the service was good and the manager came by our table to make sure all was okay. the young black women came back again. She was very nice. We came back on Tuesday 9/11 with a party of 12. The service was bad and there was a different manager who wasn't very nice. 
i asked for ketchup several times and she didn't respond. She wouldn't even bring salt and pepper to the table. towards the end of the night she brought some fried dough to our table. This didn't make up for poor service and poor management. Parry's was pretty empty. With poor service and mangement it will stay that way!",-1

The venue itself is pretty decent: a large main area surrounded by plush private tables (think: a bigger version of Zuma), a good sized patio with tables, and a wrap around bar that is accessible from anywhere but outside.  

Now I may be a little bias on this one because I don't believe I've gone when it's not one of their ""free Effin vodka"" nights (from 9-11), but holy hell I've never gotten so smashed on ten dollars. The bar tenders are busy as hell, but throw them a nice bone each time and they'll keep the vodka flowin.",1

Graham cracker crust was perfect thickness and delicious.  The key lime filling was great balance of tart and sweet.  Would stop by for another key lime but probably won't bother trying any onther flavors.  Only two stars because one out of three isn't very good...",-1

trn_4361,"All you can eat Japanese. We decided go order from the menu instead of the all you can eat buffet. Worst service ever. 
10 tables 4 were occupied including our party of four. 

It took 40 minutes for our order to come and it didn't all come at the same time. Only one of the orders came. Which left the other 3 staring at walls. 

The other orders came within the next 15 minutes one at a time 10 minutes apart. 

Our appetizers came after two of my friends finished their lunch. One of my friend cancelled his order because he ate our left over food.

I've been here a few times in the past and the service was always poor. I go here because my sons school is near by. But today was the worst ever.",-1
trn_4362,"The food from this place reminds me of home. I'm mostly Taiwanese, a little island off of China, but the food here has the taste of Hong Kong with a few American favorites for the locals such as the classic mongolian beef or the citrus-y orange chicken. 

I personally go for a mix of both. When I'm feeling more cultural, I'll grab some lobster with garlic, or even some chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (warning, expect this dish to be bitter, that is a valued taste in most Chinese cuisines).

Today, I grabbed some take out of the mongolian beef for myself with fried rice and egg roll, and the girlfriend at home got the chicken lo mein with fried rice and egg roll.

Dude, just the egg roll alone and a few bites out of the entreé and you are FULL. Seriously, their portions are huge. 

Expect leftovers and merry moments later in the day to finish your food.

Caveat: Don't expect the service to be very kind. When going to truly authentic Chinese places, do not expect the customer service standards of that of even a TGIF. The Chinese are very ""to the point"" when it comes to food. You go in, sit down, say hello, order some food, pay your bill, get out. Don't make chit chat.",1

But seriously, they were great. Very clean facility and the people were all quite helpful. She ended up getting a small tattoo on the inside of her wrist, a little cute flower.

trn_4370,"I'm not big on chain restaurants so this is my first visit ever to Kelseys despite driving past so many before. 

I ordered the goat cheese and beet salad with chicken. Should have asked for the dressing on the side because the salad was soaked. It wasn't bad, just not my preference. It was a lot of salad and I couldn't finish it. Aside from the amount of dressing, overall it was delicious and had a nice blend of taste.

My sister got the lunch trio and for 10.99 it's a good deal. The soup however was a bit too creamy and thick. The sandwich was on cranberry rye and was delicious. The salad is nothing to rave about but they gave you dressing options which doesn't happen for most house salads. 

Service was top notch. Very friendly server. Our glasses were always full without having to ask for refills. 

Docked one star off because the silverware was dirty and that's a pet peeve of mine when there's fingerprints all over the utensils I'm about to put in my mouth. We just grabbed a new set off another table.

Again, we had 2 cranky toddlers so we ordered a beef chow fun right away to get the girls started. That dish came out QUICK, but in good timing. As soon as that came out, we ordered the rest of the dishes. Chinese broccoli, mushroom with fried tofu, fried fish cutlets, fried chicken. All decent.

trn_4374,"Saw all the great Yelp reviews and scheduled a deep clean on 6/26 through their website, since North Royalton was listed as a city they covered.  On 7/1, I received a notice of cancellation with an email from Melissa, the owner, that she did not have a cleaning team servicing that area.  Okay, I was disappointed, but asked politely if she would then reimburse me for the $10 for $20 voucher I purchased through Yelp to use for her service.  Radio silence.  I followed up a week later on 7/8, and still nothing.  I finally got sick of being ignored and contacted Yelp directly, who was able to credit the $10 I spent (for a service that I would obviously not be able to use) on the same day I requested it.  She may do a good job--I have no idea--but bottom line, for me: unresponsive, unprofessional, and I consider that bullet dodged.

trn_4378,"Wow! My new favorite happy hour spot!

I was planning on seeing a matinée at Desert Ridge with some girlfriends on a Sunday and we were looking for a place nearby that offered happy hour on a Sunday. Humble Pie has happy hour every day of the week. YAY!

After our movie, we drove across the street to Humble Pie. It is a wee bit smaller than I expected and a little cramped. It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the patio. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the HH prices. Bud lights for $2 and ANY other draft for 2.50. And while they don't have an extensive draft selection it is a good one. Specialty drinks were only $4. My friend and I had a cucumber gin/vodka drink that was very refreshing and delicious. My other friend had a cranberry martini. I usually don't like cranberry martinis but I tasted it and it was really good. They sprinkle cinnamon on top which I think is a fantastic touch. It tasted a bit like Christmas! 

For food we ordered 2 orders of fries and 2 happy hour pizzas, one margarita and one cheese. Their fries are to die for! They rival the garlic fries at Gordon Biersch. Smothered with garlic, Parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Yum. The pizzas were pretty good. Thin crust, flavorful sauce and cheese. We ordered pretty basic pizza so I'm pretty curious about how their more adventurous pizzas taste.

So what was the damage for 4 girls with 4 drinks, 2 pizzas, and 2 orders of fries? Under $40. Such a good deal. And the staff was super nice too. You know how girls can get. Even when the food is gone our mouths keep going and we can sit and talk for hours. But the staff was gracious and patient. They will probably make regulars out of us.",1

Last night I dined at Parallax.  I arrived at 10:30 when their kitchen closes at 11.  However, our server Chris was very friendly and gave no indication that it was a bother.  He gave us great recommendations on wine and was very friendly throughout the meal.

I ordered the chicken.  It is almost exactly the same as the chicken breast at L'Albatros, except with different accoutrements.  It was very good.  We also had the gnocchi for an appetizer.  It wasn't quite what I expected, because of the brown butter.  It made the gnocchi oilier than I am used to, but the flavor was very good.

Because it was late at night, there weren't very many tables.  We ate in the lounge area which I think is a little more comfortable than the main dining room can be when it is busy.

I am enjoying Parallax more each time I visit.",1

Unfortunately the Yelpers got this one wrong or we caught them on a bad day. Lived in the Middle East for 5 years and really like the food but this was a real disappointment. I do have to say the lady at the counter was very friendly and genuinely seem liked she wanted to serve. We ordered  gyros sandwich combo, two falafel sandwich combos, chicken kabob plate, humus and baba ganoush to go. We were home in 10 minutes and began to eat.  The gyros was good, the chicken kabob was flavorful but dry. We had ordered an extra side of Tahini for the falafels  but for some reason there was none on the falafels themselves. They must have forgotten which added to making them pretty tasteless and dry. I love falafels but not these.   Fries were good to dry depending on the batch you ate from. The absolute worst was the pita bread they included for the bland boring hummus and plain baba ganoush.  It was some of the driest and chewiest pita bread I have ever tried to eat. Just terrible! They were pulling the pita out of bags at the diner so none of it is made there. Any way, not a great food experience. Certainly not a 4 star. Maybe 2 or maybe 3 stars if you give consideration for friendly staff. Not far from my home but I doubt we would go back. Too bad. Would have been nice to find a good pita place nearby.",-1

trn_4393,"Pita Jungle is a pretty solid place in my book. My 4-star rating is for my overall experience here over a few visits. Tonight probably would have been more like 3.5 stars. I really didn't feel like cooking tonight because that would require me to go grocery shopping so I recommended to my fiancé to grab dinner here. 

We sat out on the patio because we probably won't be able to sit outside at night for much longer because this summer heat is creeping up fast. 

From the seasonal menu, we ordered the avocado hummus. Why? Because I was telling myself it was healthy fats so it made myself feel better about eating all that pita bread with it. 

For my entree, I went with the chicken tikka masala. I went with it because my boss always orders it so I wanted to give it a try. Honestly, I'm not sure if I would order it again. It tasted fine but I wish it had a little bit of spice to it and also, it was just somewhat warm when it got to the table. I think my plate was warmer than my food. The brown rice seemed like it was cooked with not enough water so it ended up a bit drier than it should be. 

My fiancé made a smarter selection tonight. He went with the chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. I had a slice of it and made a mental note to get it next time.",1
trn_4394,"I went to Biaggio's because of all the positive yelp reviews on here. . . they did not disdapoint.  They serve real pizza here.

We ordered the white pizza, it was awesome. The mozz was fresh and the ricotta was smooth and creamy. No one ingredient on the pizza was overpowering, a rarity in my opinion. The crust of thr pizza was perfect. PERFECT. It was thin, crispy but not burnt, and completely cooked. The crust was what really made the pizza and what will keep mr coming back.

The only reason I didnt rate it five stars was because the pizza had too much oil on it for me. Also, I wasnt the biggest fan of the decor, i dont think that the oversized pictures of food fit this place very well.

Biaggios is pizza without equal in west las vegas, give it a shot you wont be dissapointed.",1
trn_4395,"This place was crazy busy the Sunday before ASU started classes.  Breakfast was awesome and the portions were decent.  Loaded Omlete was my choice.  My friend had the waffles.  Both were excellent.  The oatmeal looked good too, if you are looking to be healthy.

trn_4397,"I'd like to start with the ambiance, it is absolutely gorgeous with white marble tables and a lot of natural light coming through their wide window. I've just learned about Neo coffee bar via Instagram and i've already visited 6 times in the month of February. I have tried their Matcha latte with both Almond milk and Cashew milk, as well as their traditional green tea bag, and drip coffee. With respect to goodies, i've tasted their matcha roll cake, matcha white academia cookie as well as vegan sugar free breakfast cookie - which was my absolute favourite, super nourishing, filling, chewy and satisfying. The service all 6 times has been phenomenal, as they have a smile on, greet you nicely, accomodate customers, and provide helpful answers with any questions. In addition to that, i had requested for a special latte art on my drink and the barista was kind enough to try his best to make what i requested. I would definitely recommend this place for a pick me up and lovely photos for food photographers. My only concern was seating, but if you go early enough or wait around you will definitely snatch a seat. There is a variety of couch corner tables, individual seating which can be tight but fine for one person, as well as a high top bench/bar.",1

If you are going to complicate the process with added steps, maybe you can improve your capacity at the counter, have a few more employees checking us in. 
I mean you pay them what 8.25/hr? Tickets cost $10 or so. You charge $7-8 for popcorn and it costs you .30 to make it. It's not like you can't afford a few more kids at the front desk.

Upstairs there is an bar behind 4 full size tables,  and 4 tables for two. Fish freshness was good and dishs had good flavor.

I noticed a day later that it had a dent.  Well, I delayed reporting that for a few weeks (but less than 2 months).  This is why they denied my claim, even though the ODO reads no miles, and there is a very obvious ding that only a tie-down chain could have caused.

trn_4406,"Let me preface this with a simple statement: I absolutely LOVE the food from Pita Jungle!

That being said, there are a few things that irk me about Pita Jungle.

First, the music is very loud. I'm noticing this is a common theme with the new wave of restaurants that are opening. I have asked a couple of times if the music can be turned down, but the reply I hear over and over (at multiple locations, mind you) is that the music is at ""company standard"" and that I can sit outside. This is rude, considering it is the middle of the summer in Phoenix.

Second (and this is a personal problem), I really, really wish there were french fries. I know this sounds silly, but they really do taste amazing with hummus. Oh well, the personal battle ensues.

Third, most of the people that are hired are pretty snobby and incompetent. This sounds rude, but I was in the customer service industry for a long time. I know I have high standards, but I minimally expect people to do their jobs.

Anyway, I eat here all the time. I just get the food To-Go :)",0

trn_4408,Fried Chicken Heaven. We have been looking at the reviews for a couple of months.  Wow! Hands down the best fried chicken I have had.  We started with the cheese and charcuterie platter and that would have been enough food for the two of us. It had 3 cheeses a yellow cheddar a white cheddar and a blue cheese with two types of prosciutto and a meat spread.  The blue cheese was a little to serious for me (hints of horse hoof).  Other than that our platter was wonderful.  Our waitress (Lazetta) was very friendly and helpful. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and she was extremely happy.  I tried a bite of the waffle with the bourbon sauce and it was awesome.  I ordered the house chicken with a side of grits. I have never had a better tasting fried chicken in my life. The grits were cooked perfectly and were topped with cheddar cheese.  I liked them but I would have liked them better with a softer whiter cheese.  It is definitely a place that I will return to .,1
trn_4409,"Service is horrible, staff are usually quite rude, the only ones who actually pay attention to you are the cooks when you walk in. I ordered from here for my break, got told it would be 15-20 minute wait, so I didn't take my break until it should have been ready. I got there and my sushi was sitting on the counter but waited 20 minutes until the rest of my order was ready. Wish I hadn't paid before I got my food because there would have been ZERO tip. My sushi was mushy and cold (it was tempura, so it should've been warm). Honestly not worth the money to get treated like crap by the employees and have such gross food. I've given this place far too many chances & this was the last one.
It's a great location, wish they would try harder to keep their customers happy though.",-1
trn_4410,"Meh. Went in 2015 for an exam and the staff was OK. Dr was great. Friendly and patient. They gave me a sample of Bausch and Lomb contacts to try out and within hours, my eyeballs were bloodshot red. I called and asked if this was normal and that instead of using the 'only' type of contacts they had available at their office, if I could order my usual ones. The staff wasn't so nice then. They insisted I try using Bausch and Lomb again. Since my prescription changed, I was at their mercy. I said I'd purchase another sample set just to try them again. Same reaction and the way my eyes turned completely red, I immediately took them out. Fast forward when I go back in 2017, some of the same staff is there and I notice as I'm signing in and doing my paperwork, they are showing each other my chart and looking at me. I spent over $150 and that is WITH insurance, yet again because I thought everyone deserves a second chance. I leave with no contacts or no frames because the frames are too expensive given the cost of my exam alone, and I don't like the contacts they have available through their office. I attempt to place an order online using the brand I've had luck with FOR YEARS, and I get a call just now that the company that I purchased my contacts through need to put my order on hold because they can't issue that type/brand of contact isn't on my prescription. I just got off the phone with this office and to be able to use another brand, I can go in there and order contacts (she said), to which I replied ""You don't have my brand I use"" and she said because I had been there more than 30 days ago, I would have to come in again for another exam which of course would cost more money.

They use hard wax, which is awesome since it significantly reduces the ouch factor and I'd like to think it's overall a little less harsh in my skin. They always apply this great calming cream after, which enables me to continue running my errands without sending small children running for cover after spotting my angry red eyebrow area. I usually try to get in with Ashlyn, but even if she's unavailable and I have an emergency, all the girls there have done a great job. And my personal favorite thing?

trn_4416,"I heard about this store from a friend who purchased her dress here 2 weeks before my mom and sister would be in town to help me shop. She raved about their prices and friendly staff, so I decided to make an appointment. 

This was the third store we went to; I'd already found three dresses I liked well enough, and was pretty sure I'd be going back for one of them. Melody, the consultant we worked with, was so great!!! She had us pull 5-6 dresses, and as I tried on and we talked about what I liked and did not like, she pulled different dresses for me to try- eventually, she ended up bringing out the perfect one!!! She really knows the stores stock well, which is impressive due to the ever changing stock and the fact that nearly every dress in the shop is the only one there of that same dress-- not like some of the chain stores where they only have so many styles and they stay consistent for seasons. As soon as she'd laced me into my dress, I knew it was the one! It got rave reviews from my mom, sister, and grandmother-- who stated she couldn't even think of one thing she didn't like. I don't even know if it was on the sales floor yet, as she had to go figure out the price. The price was great, and it will need minimal alterations because it fits perfectly aside from being brought up a few inches. Plus, we liked the veil she put on me so much, and it was such a great price, that we went ahead and got that, too!! They were having a St Patrick's Day raffle, and I won 10% off my purchase, saving us an extra bit of money. This store is great and I am so happy to have heard of it! 

I highly recommend Brilliant Bridal, and Melody! She has a great sense of style and knows what she is doing-- I would not have found this dress without her, and would have ended up in a dress that I merely 'liked' from that one chain store. Instead, I got a gorgeous, designer dress that I am in love with, and feel unique in!",1
trn_4417,"Definitely more high-end appearing than other taco joints in town, but still serving pretty authentic Mexican street tacos. Prices are not too high overall for food, but probably a little pricey for tacos.

Nonetheless, the flavors are excellent and there is quite an extensive offering. Get into the various different lines to order various different foods. Everything is assembled to order.

There is also a complimentary sauce/condiment bar in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite large and has additional seating upstairs.

Order at the counter, so no table service, though workers will come by to clear things off your table.

We went on a Friday about 7pm with a group of 5, took about 20 min to seat us because the place was packed. 

The rolls were yummy. My hubby disliked the sashimi because the ones he grabbed had been on the conveyor too long and were warm. Its biggest feature is also its biggest drawback. They should have some sort of marking system for when dishes go out, so that if they're not picked up by anyone fast enough they toss them. 

It took them a while to get the check and they had issues splitting it.",0
trn_4419,"Just got a delivery from them.  Probably the worst  Naam Tok and Laab I've ever had.  Both pork dishes lacked flavor and spices.  In Naam Tok the pork chunks were too thick and tasted boiled.  There was no hint of lime and zero mint leaves which generally are added to these dishes. I'm ok with them having a different recipe, but at least make it flavorful. The egg rolls were reasonably good.  Seafood Salad $15, had several pieces of squid, few mussels, and few shrimps.  The shrimp were large.  Seafood was cooked perfectly, but again, the flavors didn't come together and it was just bland.  Onion pieces were cut too big and were larger than seafood itself.  Very disappointing.",-1

After another 10-minute wait, my dish eventually came out but it was only 80% cooked, tasted gooey like eating glue sticks.

However, I tried some Mac & Cheese for my daughter, it was ""glue sticks"" as well. She did not want to eat it any more after taking five bites.

When I ordered the POD I told the woman that we had a lot of boxes and furniture and I was concerned the POD would not be big enough.  We had a two bedroom apartment and she assured me the size (the largest) would be fine - it could fit up to four rooms of furniture she said.  I told her I had some bureaus and a large entertainment center and she said it would be fine.  When the POD driver delivered the POD, I again told him I did not think the POD was big enough and he said ""you would be surprised at how much can fit on one of these"".  When the mover arrived the next day, his first words were ""all of your stuff is not going to fit"".  I was moving across country and needed to leave the next day.  This had all been scheduled and organized perfectly!  But when I called PODS in a panic to get another POD delivered, and was told I could not get another POD for 4 days, I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown.  We had to use ABF Freight, at an additional cost of $3,100 plus an additional cost of $600 for the mover to load the ABF freight at the warehouse, after my husband had to go and get a UHaul truck because the mover of course did not have a truck with him because he and his crew were loading everything on to the POD.

trn_4432,"Have you every had one of those experiences where everything at a restaurant truly was excellent? Well, that was Salvatore's. They take their menu to a whole new level. 

First there was the salad. I end up eating a huge amount of greens in the course the year, and that's fine. But it's a pretty rare day when I'm eating a salad and think to myself that the lettuce is just delicious. The salad also came with interesting vegetables -- like slices of purple carrots and speckled string beans (I HATE string beans by the way, but gladly ate these). 

After talking with the waiter I realized that they had just come back from the farmer's market with everything. A lot of food here either comes directly from the farmer's market or from the farm itself, and it makes a big difference.   

Then there is the beer: a very nice mix of small, craft breweries.

Then there is the pizza. If you are looking for just peperoni, this is not your place. I'm really up for creative pizzas, and Salvatore's doesn't disappoint. When there are too many things that look good on the menu and you can't make up your mind, then you are in a good place. 

I ended up with the Fig and Bacon (Cabernet poached mission figs, with gorgonzola cheese,  balsamic red wine reduction, and bacon). Excellent! 

Easily could have also gone for: 

Forestiere (Thinly sliced onions, bacon lardons, crème fraiche, Pleasant Ridge Reserve,  fresh thyme and local mushrooms)

When we went back to Las Vegas, I figured that we had to visit Battista's again, so we stopped by - with the same friend who was married on our last visit.  As it turned out, none of us really drank (other than to taste the wine that still flows freely).  We found out that it's really pretty bad.  Sure, it is included, but the reason for that is that it's just not very good.

The steak ($22.00) was maybe 1/4 inch thick and had a kind of fish taste to it like they are cooking fish and beef in the same area or the same pan - we call this cross contamination. 

The Not yo momma's pot pie was definitely NOT my momma's. For the $11.00 we could have gone to the store and bought 4 frozen pot pies and it would have tasted better.

I was with my wife and son. While my wife (a vegetarian) couldn't decide what to eat, I had to help my son with the paper towels in the bathroom because the dispenser was jammed. Upon my return to the counter, my wife informed me that the chef had been coughing and that she didn't want to eat anything. I still ordered for me and my son.

We sat down in the small seating area. My BLT wasn't bad. Quality bread. But very little tomato and barely a smidgen of lettuce. I basically ate bread for lunch. My son didn't love the grilled cheese sandwich, but this likely relates to a different kind of cheese than he's used to opposed to quality. 

The tables still had some remains from the last people who ate there, and the windows weren't spotless, but that's being a little too tough. No big deal. 

Overall, it might be worth a shot if you live nearby. Otherwise, not a place to travel for, at least in my opinion. I would not eat here again. That said, the reviews are high, so my experience could have been a fluke.",0
trn_4450,"This is a nice, quaint breakfast/brunch place catered to a younger, more hipper crowd based on the atmosphere and food choices. Casual environment makes it a good meet-up place with friends in the early AM.

Food was decent, a little bit more pricy for breakfast for Chinese fare, but they have some interesting choices. I would recommend the egg crepes (it was light and tasty but expensive for the amount you get). Noodles were okay, but there's a lot of good noodle shops in the area, so nothing to write home about.

I saw a lot of people got their sandwiches which I will try next time as it seems to be the specialty!",1

Everything was good quality, tasty, service was pretty good, they kept the endless mimosas coming...it was a good brunch. Nothing really was that spectacular that it stood out to comment on, but it was still a good brunch spot. One thing that i was completely disappointed with was the dessert section. As i was enjoying my brunch, i kept eyeing those french macrons. OMG, right???? They have french macrons! Who doesn't love em!?? Unfortunately, when i went to get them, they were all gone. Gone, as in not coming back out. We asked and the lady behind the counter said they were done and not making anymore. Umm? Seriously? You ran out of something at a buffet? I haven't experienced that EVER...and i definitely wouldn't have expected it at a pricey buffet at the Bellagio. Totally disappointed with that part of things. Oh well. Meh.",0

trn_4454,"Lagerheads is a Distinct Pleasure

There are very few restaurants in Medina, Ohio that can be described as a great experience. Lagerheads demonstrates that good food and drink are possible outside of urban environments.

Lagerheads brews their own beer, and it is quite tasty. One act of poor judgement of the 200th Aniversary Committee was denying the community the pleasure of a quality beverage that represents the excellence of the people of Medina. Any ways, the beer is cold and good!

The food is excellent. If you like smoked meats and thick, juicy burgers, then you are looking at the right place for a great meal. Go there! The only problem with Lagerheads is that it often gets crowded and parking is impossible. Hopefully the owners will resist the temptation to expand. When places go for size, quality often suffers. I would rather wait.",1

I guess we were all thinking in synch because everyone at my table ordered the same thing.  The only odd thing is that one of the 4 people had a slightly smaller chicken piece.  Other than that, the dinner was delicious.  We sat in the outdoor seating, but I stepped inside periodically to check out the eclectic decor inside.  Lots of big screen TVs everywhere for sports fans.  Service was a little slow at first. Meaning, it took forever for them to bring waters and the drink orders, but once they did the food arrived not long after.

trn_4461,"a friend and i were in bowling green, ohio for an orientation for school and for our last night in ohio, we decided to rent a car and drive out to cleveland. she wanted to try sushi rock after reading a little blurb about it in a ""discover what clevelands about"" type of magazine. she liked the idea of a ""live dj"" haha i didnt expect much, since im pretty picky about what i consider ""good"" sushi. anyway, so we walk in

us: two please
hostess: do you have reservations?
us: no...
hostess: oh! its ok! right this way...

it was pretty nice in side. they have a bar area in the front and then a sushi bar in the back and a few tables here and there and then an upstairs with big booths and tables, which is very dimly lit. maybe half of the downstairs was filled but we were taken upstairs, where there were only about 3 tables taken. and then we noticed that those other tables were occupied by OTHER asians like ourselves.  hmm... jokingly we said to each other ""is this where they seat the asians?"" but maybe we really did feel that way because as the night when on, there were more asians being sat upstairs... weird.

anyway, our waiter was very nice. great service. he recommend anything that was a sushi rock signature item. so i got the beef sushi. sounds nasty but it was this beef tenderloin in a sake and soy sauce reduction i think. very tender and very tasty! it came with two little pieces of sushi rice (like a strong vinegar taste. kind of awkward for me with the beef) and this ""mushroom stick"" thing, that looked like one of those cigar like pastry things with this weird tasting cream sauce with mushrooms inside. i just ate all the beef... 

my friend ordered the lobster crab cakes which were pretty tasty. it came with this spicy sauce which went really well with the crab cakes.

we also ordered a sushi rock roll (Shrimp, crabstick, salmon, spicy tuna, asparagus, masago) and a rock and roll (Shrimp tempura, crabstick, avocado, cucumber). the rock and roll was just OK but the sushi rock roll was pretty good. definitely too big to try and eat in one bite. 

i ordered a peach mojito which was made with peach puree. pretty tasty. my friend got one of their red wines and said it was pretty good too.

if you ever go, i definitely recommend the beef sushi.",0

trn_4463,"2.5 stars. I expected more from Union Social Eatery and I just had a disappointing dish in the Penang Noodle bowl. I am sure I would have had a better experience without that dish, so stick with the tried and true classics! 

For the appetizers we had the pulled pork poutine, and two salads in the big market salad and the herbed spinach salad. The pulled pork poutine was excellent and probably my favorite thing I had. Good fries, gravy, and the pulled work was really tender. Great balance of sweetness too! I really liked the herbed spinach salad which included beats, cheese, and all in a very nice vinegrette. There's definitely enough portion size wise and if you add a protein, the salad can definitely be a meal.

The main was more disappointing. I had the chicken Penang noodle bowl and it just didn't have much flavor at all. I do not recommend this dish at all!  It wasn't sweet, salty, nor creamy enough. The curry wasn't curry and was more oil based. There was a lack of red curry and also vegetables, and chicken. It was mostly all noodles, combined with the fact that there wasn't much flavor going on, made it a very difficult task to finish.

However, portion size was acceptable here (you get what you pay for), and service was nice and friendly (but on the slower side - i.e. for initial checkup, drinks, and speed the food got out). The environment was quite pleasant.",-1

Showed as 21.76 for the total but then brought us a different receipt after bringing out the extra fries that he admitted he forgot to put in. New total was 19.78. It didn't have the fries on it so we assumed that he had taken them off to compensate for the time we had to wait for the rest of our order. So we left a nice tip and made sure to thank him. Got up to the register and she scanned in the receipt to pay and it rang up for the 21.76. I understand that this was what we got and we paid but what a shitty move. Then the girl that cashed us out pretty much blew off our issue. The fact of the matter is whether it's off 2 cents or 30 bucks, the check was different than what we were presented with. And after we paid she took off while I'm putting the change in my purse without giving me a receipt to show what I actually paid. I had to flag down one of the cooks to ask if someone could produce me a receipt. He's response: We don't give receipts on cash purchases. This is not the first steak n shake I've been too.

Dean W. O'Connor, P.L.L.C 
1212 E. Osborn Rd. suite 109 
Phoenix, Arizona 85014 
PH: (602) 965-9555
Dean@Dean-oconnor.com

On November of 2014, I interred into a verbal agreement with Dean O'Connor to represent me in a Family Law case FC2005-011856. On November of 2014, I gave him $1000.00. Although this was a flat free for a $1,000.00, I did provide additional money on 03/19/2015 $500.00 and on 04/03/2015 $500.00 and on 05/ 18/2016 $1,000.00 and on 05/31/2016 $250.00 to perform the follow duties that were agreed to: 

1. Counsel shall draft a proposed pursuant to Court order outlining the therapist's duties and submit it to the Court. (Dean O'Connor did not perform this duty as hired.)

2. Help guide Valentyna through therapy to complete a good evaluation. (Dean O'Connor did not perform this duty as hired.) 

3. Once a good evaluation has been obtained from the psychologist, O'Connor shall prepare and file a Motion for reconsideration for visitation at my home from Thursday through Sunday. (Dean O'Connor did not perform this duty as hired.)

4. Dean O'Connor also was obligated in this agreement to file a Contempt of Court Order against Mr. Sprinkle for not providing Court Order phone visitation on Wednesday at 5:00 p.m. (Dean O'Connor did not perform this duty as hired.) 

Further more, one of Dean O'Connor's selling points was that he would always provide Valentyna with free consultation. In fact, he has inferred on many occasions that he was doing me a big favor for not charging me for reading e-mails and talking to me over the phone and in person. But in his accounting of the fees, he doses just that he bills Ms. Sprinkle for phone calls, e-mails, and in person interviews.  
 
Note: The only things disgusted in these contacts were why he was not performing his contractual duties.

The above agreement was estimated By Dean O'Connor at 5 to 8 hours - a maximum of $1600. AS A FLAT RATE (See agreement between attorney and client date Nov. 14, 2014 attached to this complaint.) Note: This was verbal and PARTLY CONTRACTIUAL -not all wrote out. The second half of the contract was never signed by Valentyna for $200.00 hour. Although, she did not agreed to $200.00 an hour O'Connor tried to charge her $250.00 hour for e-mails, phone calls, and in person talks relating to why he was not doing what the court order requires of him and what she hired O'Connor for.

More over, the nine motions that O'Connor did file were so frivolous that the court barred Ms. Sprinkles (not in full but in part) from filling any more motions- basically, increased the criteria that she needs to meet. In fact, the motions were only a rehashing of old motions that where filed by other attorneys. Obviously, the issues were already heard and denied. The question is why would an attorney file motions that he knows or should have known would be rejected by the court, and why wouldn't he fallow the criteria the court clearly lead out for Ms Sprinkle to follow and to show the courts that she was confident to request her contact visitation back.

THE COURT NOTES that the Court would consider whether Mother is ready for unsupervised visitation once the therapy has started and initial reports have been provided to the Court from Mother's therapist (or other authorized individual)."" (Page3 paragraph 3).

T0 sum up 

Dean O'Conner was provided a total of $3,250.00 to perform his contractual duties above 1 through 4. 
Dean O'Conner DID NOT outline the therapist's duties and submit it to the Court.
Dean O'Conner DID NOT Help guide Valentyna through therapy to complete a good evaluation. 
Although Dean O'Conner prepare and file a Motion for reconsideration for visitation at my home from Thursday through Sunday, he did not follow courts criteria's for reconsideration.
Dean O'Connor DID NOT file a Contempt Rule 92 Rules of Family Law Procedure of Court Order against Mr. Sprinkle for not providing Court Order phone visitation on every Wednesday at 5:00 p.m... On numerous occasions Ms. Sprinkle requested for contempt motions to be filed. Although one motion was filed, O'Connor withdraws before the hearing took place without confirm his client of the continued the hearing unreasonable",-1

trn_4498,"Horrible customer service! It's ridiculous to believe that the largest department store in all of Canada cannot get their customer service right! I don't usually like to write critical reviews, but SEVERAL bad experiences shopping there have compelled me to write this one. Here are the things that I found from my shopping experiences there:

1. Above the first floor of the store, it was VERY difficult to find any sales rep around to help me. Once, I went to an upper floor to shop. There was only one sales rep at the cash, and she was preoccupied with chatting with another customer for about 20 minutes! And so, I looked for another person to help me, but the only other person around that I could find refused to help me, as she said that she doesn't work at that department (she also didn't even offer to help me find another sales rep)!

2. For the shoes section, the warehouse that stores all of the shoes seems to be far away from the actual sale section. And so, sales reps have to call someone to bring the shoes back for customers. The sales rep that was helping me accidentally ordered the wrong size from the warehouse, so I had to wait even longer for the right size shoes to be brought to me.

3. The sales reps seem poorly trained. The sales rep that helped me in the shoes section accidentally misplaced the shoe box that contained the shoes that I tried on. Then, when I went to pay for my shoes. She couldn't find the box! Apparently, another sales rep must have returned the box back to the warehouse.

It's such a SHAME that the Bay cannot provide some decent customer service, as I actually like the products that they sell. It's no wonder that Sears, Target, and lots of other department stores in Canada had to declare bankruptcy or shut down. The retail market in Canada does not understand what good customer service means!",-1

trn_4500,"The first time I came was on Friday when they had soft opening. I came around two pm and the server said they were not ready and already informed in Facebook that they will open at 5pm. (Darn, I was like so hungry, long drive too..)

The second time I came with my friends. The drinks came quite fast although we have to wait more than 40 minutes for the server to take our order.

The green tea, when it first came, the color quite thick green, very nice flavor, not too sweet. The second drink, the color got light, watery, and sweeter. 

The ramen house black that I ordered, the flavor was light. Tips for you guys who usually like salty food, you will need more salt or soy. The pork meat was very soft and great flavor, little bit salty, so I think it quite balance with the broth. 

The takoyaki, the fried very nice outside, but the batter inside wasn't cook enough, so we ordered the second one and ask them to cook it longer, it turned out very good.

The calamari fried, no batter on it, so I thought, maybe they concept was super less batter, (I think..lol). 

Overall, all the foods that we ordered was OK. 

The services, OMG, they only have 2 servers and keep meshed up the the order even she wrote it on her paper, but still she keep asked us like 3 times, and sent the wrong one. Which part that she missed actually? lol...For that, one star for the services, but again, I would like to give them 3 stars for their patience for taking care the angry's customer.",0
trn_4501,"Per my very, very informative cabbie who drove me to Aloft from the airport, Cleveland will be home to many a new hotel in the next year or two. With the new Global Center for Health Innovation, it's no wonder that hotels are popping up all over town. Thus, it's nice to see that Aloft is ahead of the game and supporting the businesses and conventions that are (or will be) in town. 

It's important to note, above all else, that the staff at Aloft are fantastic. They're friendly and informative, helpful and cheerful - all the things you're looking for in a hotel. The location of Aloft is also pretty prime if you need to be anywhere near the Flats. You'll find tons of walkable restaurants and bars nearby. 

The decor of the hotel and bar is slick and modern - typical Aloft style. Light sleepers should be well aware of some major hiccups - the train shook my bed (on the 6th floor) so hard at 12:30am on a Thursday, I got up to make sure it wasn't me who was convulsing. And while I'm not a super light sleeper, I heard doors slamming loud and clear throughout the night and traffic along the roads (which is no surprise as my room faced that direction). The room, however, was impeccable, with a comfy bed and nicely appointed desk, outlets, free bottled water, and TV. Pair the desk with super stable WiFi, and you have a solid work environment right in your room. 

Food wise, I typically enjoy the grab and go setup of Aloft. My turkey bacon wrap was fresh and I appreciate the we're-not-trying-to-take-advantage-of-you pricing. There are snacky items that will appeal to most and plenty of cold beverages like Honest Tea and vitaminwater. 

I'd stay at this Aloft again if I need to be in this area, but next time I think I'll utilize the free earplugs they provide!",0
trn_4502,"I was in Mesa for the morning and found this gem. I was greeted with a big smile and friendly service. The almond latte was really good, like REALLY good!

If I need coffee in Mesa again, this will be my go to place.",1

trn_4505,"Creeper alert.

A little over a year ago, I moved to Scottsdale, and returned my U-haul here. No big deal. Thought nothing of it.

Today, I returned to buy some packing materials. As I walked in the store, things were laid out in usual clustershuck fashion. Boxes and whatnot in no order.

The first item I wanted was bubble wrap. To pack my vintage action figures, beer glasses, and whatnot. Of course.

The moment, I touched the bubble wrap, and attendant quickly approached me and asked if I needed help. I said, no thank you. Then he stood there. And stared. At me. Like a rapist. 

Yeah, I said it. Like a freaking rapist. He didn't move. He just stood there and stared. I didn't know what to say, other than, I don't need any more help. 

After the longest 10 seconds of my life, I said, ""so....this bubble wrap...it's made of high quality plastic eh?"" And the Jackass still didn't catch my drift. 

At this point, I whipped out my credit card and said, let me just pay for this.  I had a ton of other stuff to buy, but I felt so freaking uncomfortable here because of the U-haul rapist. I am never coming back.

If you need packing supplies, need to rent a truck, or are planning on moving, don't come here. Your soul will be stolen by this guy.

Thank God, I rented my truck from Penske. 

U-haul? More like U-fail.",-1

So much so we went back that night and had dinner! We told the other team parents this is a spot from now on- we need to come back to again and again. Wings are to die for! Many flavors to choose from and the beer is quite tasty too! My husband and I both had the brisket sandwich and a bowl of yummy onion soup. My dinner choice was homemade mac n cheese, coleslaw and cornbread that I could have eaten a dozen muffins. Another parent had the BBQ mixed platter and could barley finish it! Everyone raved about the onion rings as well. Too many good things to choose from on the menu. We will eat here every time we're in town with our soccer team.

I thought i might have a termite problem but after a few questions from Dave he figured it wasnt termites i have but crickets! Dave even walked me through google pics to ensure what i saw. He also gave me a great price and worked with my schedule to get an appt set for next week. If i go w the other reviews i pretty sure the service will be great too!

trn_4512,"i thought this was an awesome store.  you feel like everything in it is of a strong quality from the boots to the jackets to the traditional cowboy shirts.

as should be expected, their selection of cowboy boots is vast.  they have boots in leather and furthermore in that category are very detailed, bold and funky styles (that i would guess would be more for the women than men, but hey no ones judging, and who cares).  they also have a wide display of motorcycle boots, ones that go up to just below the knee and others that just rid above the ankle.

i think cowboy boots are pretty cool, and it might be one of the few things i think i couldnt pull off - or maybe theyd just be horrible for my feet, but if thats what you need this SURELY is the place.

i found their display of shirts and leather jackets were impressive as well, and with all the interest in vintage clothing, and funkier styles of shirts a good ol' cowboy shirt can fit in perfectly (as long as youre not wearing chaps).  i wish i may i wish i might but i dont ever think i could walk the streets here with a cowboy hat, though id love to get one one day and they also do well on that count (at least from a non-cowboys perspective.)

though it does seem kinda funny to see a store such as this in toronto, it is necessary and perfect and a great spot for those who have stronger ties to these types of looks. 

but im sure theyve been here a billion times before.",1

The place is nice and bright and clean.  It's a perfect little spot for a snack or meal.  

One word of caution though, you have to come during the main part of the day, not too early or too late because not all of the baos will be available.  I learned the hard way =(",1

I even asked for the soup to be medium spicy and the pad thai to be medium to hot. The Pad Thai has got to be one of the worst I have ever eaten. There is no egg, no tofu and no peanuts which is listed as included on the menu. It literally is just greasy noodles with a few pieces of chicken and a wedge of lime. Terrible, I won't be ordering from this place again. Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else.",-1

Long story short going here and getting my hair cut from Stephan who also cuts my best friends hair and his brother was an amazing choice, He did an amazing job and would suggest him to anyone!!! Only reason why I'm giving the barbers chair a 4/5.

Out of what I saw he was the most professional as he focused on me the customer the whole cut and never talked to his co-workers once which is something small but means a lot (I bring this up because as I was waiting I noticed the ladies who cut hair their really do a poor job focusing on the customers and rather talk about what they ate for lunch with each other so keep that in mind when choosing which barber you want to go to)... Stephan focused on small details and I can't thank him enough for such a good hair cut.",1

trn_4529,"Nice vibe! Lots of cool interior design. We sat at the bar and only order cocktails and appetizers because we couldn't get a table on the patio. So a tip is to call ahead and advance to get a reservation if you likes on the patio because it's absolutely not going to happen if you are walking in on a busy night. My bad!
One really interesting appetizer was the trio of bruschetta and you were able to pick which ones you wanted. They were very good and a real fun appetizer to share with my husband. I highly recommend Oil & Ivy if you really want to get a feel for modern Scottsdale culinary landscape.",1

If it's your first time in Vegas you should go here. Also be careful because the ground is slippery and once I fell and landed on my back pretty hard, but thats ok because I was drunk and I couldn't feel much, so I got back up and started partying again.

also, they close really early on tuesdays . i dont know if that's the case anymore but once i came all the way from north york after work, DURING rush hr, cuz i wanted the food so bad but they were closed when i got there . :( i left them a note and shoved it in the gap of their door cuz i was so disappointed . i dunno if they got it or not . =P",1

This was a Saturday night at 6 but the place was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted by our server, I forgot her name, and drinks came out right away. We had the chips and salsa, street corn dip and a variety of tacos. The green chili chicken, bbq adobo and pineapple pork were all very tasty. You can have them on soft flour or corn or hard shell. The sweet corn ceaser and totrtilla soup were both a hit with our group as well. Service was fantastic and the restaurant is so cute. I'll definitely go back!

Update! I went in yesterday and Levi was our server. He was training someone and they were fantastic! The sangria was tasty and we tried the guacamole, which was creamy and delicious. I did a salad that was awesome. Quinoa, seeds, papaya and we added steak. It was with the best vinaigrette I think Ive ever had. Coconut! Amazeballs. Plantain taco was also great.

trn_4542,"""I want to try poke (as in to jab or prod, pronounced p, long o, k)"" my Chi town poker bud tells on the way to the cashier holding racks of checks that once belonged to me.

""Huh?"" I reply

""Yeah, you know, poke, the raw fish stuff you guys from Hawaii eat"" he attempts to clarify.

""I don't get it.  The hell you saying?"" I say looking like a confused dog with my head tilted to one side.

""Poke made with fish, you know poke, poke, poke"" being totally serious as he jabs his finger into my side.

Yes, were talking ahi limu poke, wasabi shoyu poke, etc. 

Is it as good as back home?  No.  But it is prepared in a way that makes it more approachable to mainland taste.  Cultural sharing through food is a good thing.

The various selections of ahi poke are made from previously frozen fish.  The sauces are deeply flavored but since the fish is not fresh when marinated, the flavor does not permeate it, just coats the outside.  Limu (fresh, raw seaweed) is used very sparingly and lacks the texture and ocean flavor you would expect.  Several types of poke such as the raw salmon (with onion, green onion, soy, sesame oil and sesame seeds) and  ahi kim chee poke (exactly as it's name implies) are not traditional but taste surprisingly good.

Prices are high compared to Hawaii (about $12.50 per pound for frozen fish) but expected.  It's a poke shop in the desert after all.

Recommended for those wanting a taste of Hawaii or the Hawaii expat jonesing for a fix of home.

trn_4543,"I went to Bottiglia for bunch. The aesthetics were great and they had a very presentable staff. BUT, service was just bad. My food came before my drink. Our server was confused half the time. It took our server forever to get our check, and another eternity to run the transaction. Mind you, we didn't even have separate checks and there were two tables tops in his section. The food was just not good at all. I had the chicken parm-- bland, pretentious and over priced. We also ordered gnocchi-- mush, mush and more mush in canned tomato sauce.  If that sauce is house made, please reevaluate that recipe because that was not good. It was probably the same bland sauce they used in the chicken parm just with a touch on cayenne pepper. It was just bad. The gnocchi wasn't even sautéed the way a proper gnocchi should be, it was probably ripped open from a package of pre-made gnocchi from Target, boiled and thrown in thinned out Hunt's tomato sauce. And what happens when you bake mush in a pool of sauce? You get the picture. We paid almost $200, and normally it that would be a fair check for four for brunch, but it really was not worth it. I later found out that they were actually managed by Clique Hospitality and I've learned from past experiences that they're restaurants are nothing short of disappointing. Great drinks, but the food and service was very pretentious and just overall bad. It's a shame because the restaurant is designed beautifully. They're food and FOH operations need a lot of work.

trn_4548,"I have been doing keto for over 6 months and having a stall. My husband recommended a doctors review of my current situation. My husband researched keto doctors in Arizona (on the Jimmy Moore site) & suggested I make an appointment. I called and spoke to F/O staff completely explaining the reason I wanted to come in to see the doctor. I was told Dr Derosa did not see patients anymore, but trained each health care provider on her way of medicine. I had an appointment booked almost a month out. I did not request any specific person due to the fact I left it up to the F/O scheduler to put me with someone who could address my keto concerns. I checked into the front desk 15 mins early and gave them my name & was told to sit down until my appointment. Less than 2 minutes to my appointment time I was asked ""why I was there?""... Then I instructed to fill out over 10 pages of paperwork due to the fact the person who scheduled me did not write why I was coming in to see the doctor. I was brought back before finishing the paperwork and met with Kylie Kersten FNP. She was friendly, concerned and listen to my story. Asked a few questions and ran blood work. Did not mention or ask one keto related question. Neither negative or positive about this way of life. I left feeling defeated and like I wasted my time. I explained to my husband who took the time to research keto doctors in Arizona and he was frustrated that Dr Derosa advertised as a keto specialist. After my blood draw I was told to return in one week for follow up. The F/O staff did not have an opening for over three weeks. I now have to wait 3 weeks to review my blood work. Feeling frustrated again. Not impressed with this office for my specific concerns. This is not a Keto/low carb option.",-1

trn_4550,"The good: The most important item a hotel can provide is a comfortable bed and mine was excellent. The rooms are clean and spacious. 

The bad: The hotel shuttle wasn't air conditioned and they picked us up in 95 degree heat. The person who checked us in also cooked our first meal and cleaned the lobby. Maybe they were understaffed but never seen this before. The NBA playoffs were on ABC and that channel did not work in our room so we went downstairs to the lobby to watch and although the channel was on they could not get the sound to work. There is no decent restaurants nearby (walking distance) so you're stuck with three fast food place and the hotel lobby restaurant which we tried our first night after checking out the other walk-able offerings. I ordered a spinach salad and they served a large plate of cut spinach and pretty much nothing else. 

Despite this, I would come back here due to the great beds and accept the fact that I'll need to eats meals away from the general vicinity.

On 7/1, I received a notice of cancellation with an email from Melissa, the owner, that she did not have a cleaning team servicing that area.  Okay, I was disappointed, but asked politely if she would then reimburse me for the $10 for $20 voucher I purchased through Yelp to use for her service.  Radio silence.  I followed up a week later on 7/8, and still nothing.  I finally got sick of being ignored and contacted Yelp directly, who was able to credit the $10 I spent (for a service that I would obviously not be able to use) on the same day I requested it.  She may do a good job--I have no idea--but bottom line, for me: unresponsive, unprofessional, and I consider that bullet dodged.

The run down....
- Great choices and selection from the buyers. They really know how to select the brand's and designs they carry in Nordstrom as it offers a distinction of choices compared to what they sell at the stores in Eaton Centre and Saks.
- Excellent variety of skincare brands. You name it, they have it. Especially the little must- have travel section. Convenient and great products perfect for on- the-go.
- Concierge services available for Torontonians and can be delivered within 2 hours. 
- Personalisation services for purchases made in Nordstrom for only $8
- Great location and ease of accessibility layout and entrance, exit point
- Being a coffee person, I must mention about the Ebar Artisan Coffee almost like a Starbucks. Great fresh light bites, coffee and sweet treats.

trn_4563,"I originally tracked down my former eye doctor, Dr. Carolyn Cruvant, whom I saw for exams for over 15+ years, and discovered she was now at Shepherd Eye Center. Unfortunately, I learned Dr. Cruvant doesn't do eye surgeries, so I chose the next best person; Dr. Steven Hansen to perform cataract surgery. This was done in 2016 on both eyes. I liked Dr. Hansen's honesty, professionalism, and bedside manners. I felt very comfortable having him do my eye surgery. No second guessing about him. I chose to have distance lenses because I always had to wear glasses to see far away. I didn't want two separate lenses in each eye to be able to see close up and far away. I should have listened because now that I can see far away, having to read close up is horrible! I needed reading glasses! You don't realize how many times during the day that you need to read or look at something close up and you are literally blind. So, I decided instead of wearing reading glasses hanging from a jewelry chain around my neck all day, I would go back to tri-focals that I originally wore before surgery. You need distance, computer, and close up reading to get by. At least when I'm watching television I don't need my glasses anymore. That is a plus for me! Around October 2017, I started getting ""floaters"" in my left eye. It got worse, so I saw Dr. Hansen again this week and I need laser surgery to clear up a routine problem that occurs in some patients having cataract surgery. Outpatient laser surgery, you can see right afterwards and drive yourself home. I'm very happy with Dr. Hansen and his work. The ONLY complaint I have is with the optical department in Summerlin. I ordered glasses and wanted a DARK tint that transitioned outside and was assured by the salesperson the grey tint would be best. When I got my expensive eyeglasses, the tint wasn't dark. I figured I needed to wear them outside in the sun for a few days to get the lenses to darken with use. When I brought them back with my tint concerns, I was informed the transition glasses don't go really dark outside. The salesperson that sold me my glasses and gave me false tint information wasn't working that day. Because I chose to return the glasses, and wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer due to false representation of the salesperson, I had to sign a form after a manager reviewed my complaint, and I was ""banned"" from further purchases in the optical department. Talk about salt in the wound and being insulted. Bottom line: Choose Dr. Steven Hansen as your surgeon and stay away from buying eyeglasses in their optical department!",0

This was my first Cirque show (and my second!)  I am a big Beatles fan so I am biased.

trn_4566,"I got a coupon for a free item in the mail, so I thought, ""what the truck? I'll give it a try."" 
I have to say... I was skeptical, but I will definitely try it again. The process was seamless. I ordered from my computer, their site was easy to navigate, and their prices seem really reasonable. With UberEats you pay the full restaurant price + delivery which makes it pretty pricey IMO but with this, delivery is included and you have the option to tip so even without the coupon it would be pretty affordable.
I ordered at a few minutes to 5 and had my food by 5:15, which is pretty impressive (I work in Playhouse Square).
The menu: they have a lot of options, which always makes me go hmmm... how do you do all of this? The way the menu is set up, it kind of feels like you're in a food court- choosing a dish from different restaurants with very narrow offerings. But you can filter by dietary preferences/restrictions if you want, which is a nice feature.
I ended up ordering a Cuban sandwich and curly fries. The Cuban was less than authentic, but I could tell that from the photo. But it tasted GOOD. The curly fries were really good I thought. They came wrapped in foil that was open at the top to keep them from getting soggy. I was amazed at how hot and fresh the food was when it arrived.
It was so easy and they have a lot of options, so I could definitely see trying this again.",1

I also had a Sparkling Raspberry Margarita and a lime margarita. They were both good but I preferred the lime margarita.

trn_4570,"Believe it or not, among the sushi places I've gone to in Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Miami, LA and San Francisco, this random little place in nowheresville Ohio was really  quite good!  They had very progressive sushi dishes, even back in 2002, when sushi was just becoming ubiquitous.

This is a very fun place with the right vibe to it.  Cleveland is not recognized enough for all of its charm (Rock and Roll museum, Cleveland Browns), but restaurants like Sushi Rock help make Cleveland more memorable.

The staff is knowledgeable, but not very friendly. I have been there several times and have yet to see any of the guys smile. 

The range is decent. I sense this is what keeps the place in business. 8 stalls. Fairly clean. You are expected to sweep up your own casings. There are shot up cardboard targets available for free for you to attach your own paper targets to. Cost, including tax, was $16.01.",1

trn_4580,"Just returned from the 2015 Arizona Taco Festival.

If you love tacos of all kinds, this is a must attend event!!

There was a wide variety of tacos from both local and out of area vendors and every one that I tried (at least 8) were all delicious.

As great as this event was, there are some things to consider before purchasing your tickets which are:

1. Online purchases of tickets will cost you an additional $3.00 per ticket, cheaper at the gate (and there was virtually no one in line to purchase)

2. Upon entering, go right to the $2 Token & ID Check line, you have to pay for everything in tokens ..... and if you plan to drink (other than water), expect to purchase a minimum of $30 in tokens (have to purchase in increments of $10) since tacos are $2/ea & drinks range between $6-$8/ea

3. Get there early, the place becomes busy in the afternoon

4. Honestly, this is not really a kid friendly event if you are thinking of bringing the munchkins

5. Watch the weather, there is not a lot of tents to use as shelter if it rains (especially once the place gets crowded) and the parking lot will turn to mud since it is all dirt

Overall though, definitely a fun event with lots of good eats and looking forward to the 2016 event ... and will try to make time to attend the Chihuahua Pageant.",1
trn_4581,"I feel like all I do is review valley happy hours, but this one is way at the top of the list! The sushi is beautiful, excellent quality and the daily special rolls are always killer. I've never been disappointed here.

I've also never come here outside of happy hour. It's later in the day, which is good for people with, you know, jobs and real lives. I can still come here for dinner after a day at work/school and still save big with their happy hour menu! And they have this great special when you buy a large Kirin, you can get an appetizer for $1. How sweet is that?! I usually opt for the edamame or calamari (be careful, it has jalapeños). Some of my favorite rolls beyond the daily specials are the rainbow (can't go wrong there) and the scallop bomb. Really rich dishes, and very filling!

Je ne suis vraiment pas une cliente difficile, et mes cheveux sont importants mais si je naime pas le résultat je suis capable de mendurer un mois, jusqua la prochaine coloration. J'ai pris des rendez-vous avec Yves pour ma couleur j'ai du retourner à chaque fois pour essayer de corriger. Mon copain, qui ne remarque jamais ce que je change à mes cheveux n'avait que des mauvais commentaires à faire sur la couleur que Yves me faisait, et ce, à chaque fois. La couleur désirée était blond naturel mais à chaque fois je sortais la tête grise avec des reflets mauves même parfois roses et sans oublier du orange à l'occasion. On se demande pourquoi je n'ai pas changé de coiffeur? C'est simple, j'ai cru à tous ces beaux reviews et j'ai cru que si un salon avait une bonne réputation il y aurait forcément d'excellents coiffeurs. J'ai donc laissé une chance à Yves, jusqu'à temps qu'on me refère à Aveda, un salon avec des coiffeurs talentueux. Bref, ce n'est pas tout. Vient le moment où je fréquente le salon Aveda pour ma coloration mais ils n'offrent pas la pose de rallonges. Je vais donc chez Pure, croyant qu'un autre coiffeur serait mieux que Yves. J'ai eu Nick, pour être honnête, je n'ai jamais eu d'aussi laides rallonges de ma vie, un mois et demi après la pose (je dois préciser que j'ai du retourner plusieurs fois pour des rallonges qui tombaient le jour suivant la pose) et les cheveux sont secs, mais le pire... Ils sont d'une autre couleur complètement. Ce que je déteste c'est lorsqu'il dit que c'est un effet ombré. Non, ce n'est pas un effet ombré, ce sont des rallonges pas du tout la même couleur que mes vrais cheveux. Le pire la dedans? Ça m'a couté 1200$ c'était des rallonges adhésives donc j'aurais pu les recoller pendant plusieurs mois sauf que là, elles sont affreuses, la qualité est mauvaise, le cheveux est brillant comme une peruque de faux cheveux, elles sont d'un blond atroce donc je dois tout jeter. Le pire la dedans c'est que les jours suivant la pose les rallonges se sont mises à tomber et il me chargeait pour les recoller.

Le seul point fort : ils offrent du vin lol!

I should have listened. There was one table with 2 people at it, at 9pm at night, that should have told us everything. We stood up front waiting to be seated, there was no one around to seat us. Then a waitress walked through the back and looked at us, I thought for sure she was coming up front. Wrong. She walked back and forth, didn't acknowledge our presence. Then a manager walked into the same area, looked at us and didn't smile, didn't say I'll be right with you, nothing. He turned around and started talking to the girl about some issue in the kitchen. He completely ignored the fact we were there. At that point we left. We went across the street to Village Inn (full parking lot btw). Imagine when walked in we were greeted and told they would be right with us. The manager saw us and immediately went to try and seat us while he was in the middle of something. I'm done with the Denny's. You have sealed the deal I won't be back and with the way things looked the restaurant sales won't keep you in business either.",-1
trn_4589,"Being from the east coast I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to italian/american food and have been searching for decent fare in my half dozen years here in the valley.  You may ask what right does an irish guy have to be an italian food snob and a quick reply is I've lived in both boston and nyc and if there is anywhere better in the US to develop a taste for true italian/american in the us than these 2 cities well I'm listening ... made my first visit a couple of weeks ago to La Piazza al Forno and was simultaneously greatly pleased and slightly disappointed.  We went on a weekday afternoon and had the $10 pizza, salad and soda special as well as an order of meat lasagna.   Since I'm giving a strong review let me start with the negatives first.  The service was passable at best as there were only 2 other couples in the restaraunt and the waitresses seemed more concerned with rolling silverware and prepping for the night shift than filling the drinks of the patrons finishing their lunch.  Also I was hoping for some east coast style greasy heaven in the pizza not some ""gourmet"" fare with bland sauce and shitty toppings that fit better in a salad and this is not what I found. Yet instead of being dissappointed I was pleasantly surprised and decided to roll with the flavor and see where it lead.  The pizza although not what I was hoping for was still fantastic, light chewy crust from their imported brick oven and the homemade mozzarella definately made the pie unique.  Fresh tomato with bazil and oregano sprinkles gave it a hint of an east coast taste. Light and fluffy crust which I usually don't like in a pizza was counter-balanced by the freshness of the home-made sweetish sauce and again the mozzarella really shines through and makes this pizza far above the norm (exspecially for phoenix).  Although everyone talks about the pizza the lasagna to me was where the $ is at.  Getting the flat noodles of lasagna to come out el dente instead of soggy and wet was a surprise and was a reminder of home.  The meat blend of sausage and hamburger layered with ricotta tasted like something my italian ex's mom would make in her kitchen and the  homemade mozzarella again sealed the deal.  We didn't sample the wine but the list looked very reasonable.   Two solid meals and out the door for $25 (with a %20 tip despite the crappy service) will lead me back to try this spot again.",1
trn_4590,"The food here is amazing - one of the best Thai food in the city in my opinion.  It may even give Pai a run for its money.  We ordered the masaman beef and the garlic pepper beef.

trn_4594,"As Janet K. mentioned, Potbelly is set at the far end of the West Towne mall at the edge of the food court,  making the environment much less rowdy than the main seating area.  It's convenient because you can enter from the parking lot or the food court, and with the outer door and the occasional breeze,  it doesn't feel quite as claustrophobic.  

My mom and I both ordered a Skinny Pair, which is a ""Skinny"" sandwich + side of soup for $6.60 (quite a deal).  My combination: a mushroom melt + spicy southwest veggie soup.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted with fresh mushrooms - filling, but leaving just enough room for dessert (or a Butter Rum Mocha in my case). Not too much flair. Not too much oomph. The spicy southwest veggie soup reminded me of the corn chowder from the SF Soup Company back at home - creamy and chock-full of corn kernels with just a hint of spicy - so that was a definite plus for me. 

If you are a fan of super stuffed sandwiches drenched in sauces, this is probably not the sandwich place for you. On the other hand,  if you are just looking for a hearty, wholesome meal, give this place a try. All in all, a great place to stop for lunch or a quick dinner. Potbelly me up! :9

Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the salon doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside everything is great. The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. 
Johnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with. He did a great job and was also really personable.

Having now been here numerous times, I've yet to have an experience that I wouldn't call anything less than good. On my most recent dining experience, my date and I were looking for dessert only. The dessert selection was quite vast, but we both chose a mini trio of desserts, which included a mini cheesecake, lava cake, and panna cotta. We paired our dessert with one of their many dessert wines. Service was good but we did run into an issue with the gift card. Apparently, they recently switched vendors and the balance was showing up as $0 when it actually was $50. The manager took a look online and verified the correct amount and gave us the remaining balance on a huge paper certificate. Sonoma Grille is under the same ownership of Perle (in Market Square). I'll add that we had the same issue with the same gift card at Perle, but they did not look online and, instead, we were forced to pay cash that night.",1

I think you're better off with beer or paying the price for some of their specialty drinks, as the malibu/pineapple was not strong.  I've been to this location twice.  The first time, I had a steak salad that was to-die-for that has since been removed from the menu :(  Last time I went with my boyfriend and we split the Sugar Factory Salad and a Tomato Basil Pizza.  They were nice enough to add marinara to the pizza, which doesn't come with it, but only a little.  Over all a nice place to go if you want to get one of their gigantic goblet drinks for fun ($36), or if you're out on the strip anyway, but pretty pricey for a dinner out.  The first time I went was for a bachelorette party and they were very accommodating and friendly.  The second time, we had a Groupon :)

Edit: forgot to mention the dessert - we had the drunken sundae, which consisted of Guinness gelato topped with Irish whiskey sauce, miniature brownies, and whipped cream (all non-alcoholic) and it was AMAZING.

I've never had soup dumplings and they had it here so we placed an order but we got something that I wasn't expecting, but it was so good! We ordered wrong and got the pork and vegetable potstickers. All the dumplings were together in 1 which was kind of a pain.

The show is a fun girls night out kind of pit stop. We drank and watched a outrageous show of half naked men. And at some points of the show, fully naked men. 

My friend, who was celebrating her bachelorette party, was pulled up onto the stage. She later told me that the guy was very forceful with her. Yet she said she had a blast! It was so funny! 

After the show, we wanted to take a photo with the performers. So we stood in a long line. The line went all the way to the bar in the back of the theater. Once we got up to the front of the line we were told it was 20$ per a person even though we wanted to take one photo. So that's 20$ per a person regardless of taking one huge group photo or individual photo shots. They only take cash for their photo booth. We only had $30 in cash so we told the bride to be to take a solo photo. We were pretty bummed. But the photo with the bride to be and the performers was pretty epic. She was engulfed with rows of sweaty hot men. It's a great keepsake.

The welcome was warm and inviting.... friendly. Then the chips came with 2 kinds of salsas. I am a bit confused. They're American Cantina chips. Where's the authentic deep fried tortilla chips???? Negative 5 points. The salsas were mediocre. I didn't taste the authenticity of the flavors. 

Now, many will rant like crazy about me:""you're Asian, what do you know about Mexican food?"" Let me tell you to--PAUSE, hold on to your tas-tas, and let me finish my review. When you grow up in TACO FLATS USA-California, your expectations are set high. Why? Because Juan, Jose & Maria's grandma used to do a lot of Latin foods. You definitely could even go to Sal's little taco stand and receive the best Buche taco and never looked at it any differently. Yes, be spontaneous and allow yourself to go balls deep into trying everything once.... enough said. Muchas Gracias! 

Pros:

Great customer service 
Big portions for what you pay for
Open bar
Family friendly 
Clean


Cons:

Lack of authenticity in Latin flavors

Chips-cantina style
Steak over cooked (ordered med. rare)
Salsas lacked flavor


#chipotlebeatsLosCucos worst part..... I HATE CHIPOTLE FRANCHISE.... I am all about small joint places and support local businesses! 

So, I warned you. 

You're welcome.",-1
trn_4607,"There are two people in the entire world who I have entrusted to cut my hair...my mother (who owns salons) and Carrie Bupp at the Robert Cromeans Salon.

As you can imagine, growing up with a mother who is a hair stylist, I am extremely particular about my hair. Because I don't get a chance to see my mom as often as I'd like, I decided to trust Carrie for my hair cuts and I have no regrets.

The salon itself is lovely. It is located on the beach level of Mandalay Bay. Although I am a person who has been spoiled enough to receive free hair treatment my entire life, I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for and Carrie is worth every penny here. She listens to you, is very knowledgeable and also does fantastic up-dos.

Ladies, (and guys), go see Carrie. She is fantastic. Tell her that Lisa S. referred you ;)",1
trn_4608,Great place to spend a night with friends enjoying good drinks and good food. The small plates are a fun way to snack on better-than-authentic Spanish foods. The flavor combinations can only be described as incredible. I particularly enjoyed the Morcilla Sausage and the Pato Escabeche (duck leg).,1
trn_4609,I had the chicken BBQ salad with a glass of locally brewed Porter Beer.  Of course since everyone there has a plane to catch the service is fast and the food is good.,1
trn_4610,"Quiet and friendly!!! This is not my first time here... It is fresh and flavorful!!! The chef is always here and sitting looking proud of his dishes as he should be!!! They are all prepared in an authentic Indian ovens and pits... Besides the lunch buffet which is amazing, I recommend trying some of their unique specialties which one would rarely see on an Indian buffet... Most of my Indian eating experiences have only been buffets until now... The chef recommend som amazing items.... On the section of the menu labeled, South Indian menu, there is an amazing crepe made from lentils, it has different choices for fillings, but it is a must try... I think it's called, dosa... Try it let me know what you think... It is vegan and gluten free as are many things on the menu... Atmosphere is great.... Bring a party here... Could get busy so call ahead... I bet the chef tasting menu is the way to go dinner time!!!",1
trn_4611,"This Mediterranean style restaurant is located inside SLS hotel. I had a nice Christmas dinner here last year thanks to the manager who corrected some minor issues caused by a few staff members who seemed flustered by the busy crowd that night. I had the seasonal lamb shank and flatbread and hummus. Both were very tasty. The lamb was a pound of tender meat with a pomegranate balsamic reduction over couscous ($37). I paired it with a house red. In hindsight, it was way too much food for just me but I enjoyed it. Would return.",1
trn_4612,"I have NEVER had an employee at any restaurant become physically violent with paying customers, until yesterday. My friends and I are regulars at Blue Agave, coming in almost every night after work for a drink and occasional beer pong. We're always respectful and have never had a problem. Tonight an employee, Eddie, asked if he could play next, and we agreed. Then before we had a chance to finish the game we were still in, he states we have two minutes to finish, and when we asked why he said he can do whatever he wants ""because he works there."" This man then becomes very hostile, getting in my friends face and actually FLIPPING the beer pong table over. He proceeds to yell and scream at my friends for the next twenty minutes, and everyone at the bar (even the people not involved) left because of it. We would hate to lose out on our favorite place because of one incident, but something has to be done when an employee becomes violent. It's unacceptable.",-1

It's not like it's bad now, it's just that there's better out there!  It's cheaper here than the other places, the dessert is good here too!  I love their fruit tart and their cheesecake!  I have good luck gambling here too!  =D...wait do I?  I can't remember, I hope I did!  I'd totally go here again after getting my fix at either the Rio or the Wynn!!",0

trn_4622,"My wife and I were starving for some good sushi and wanted to pig out on a budget. What better place then Haru Suhi, it was recommended to us by a friend thats live near there, and we were hooked. The place has a traditional REVOLVING sushi bar just like they do in Japan. ( you sit at the bar, and sushi comes around on a moving belt )

They always yell hello in japanese when you walk in and once your seated ( which sometimes you might have to wait if you wanna sit at the revolving bar)  you can sit down and start eating right a way. There is already sushi on moving belt, you just take the plate you want and start eating.  The portions are small but this way you get to try alot of different rolls and types of sushi instead of filling up on one or two rolls ( which is what I think what they wanted). 

They charge you by the plate anything from $1.00-$2.00 and if you dont see anything you like they will make anything you want ( but charge you accordingly). I recommend the VEGAS roll, BAKED SCALLOP roll, HARU sushi, and SIZZILING SALMON are some of my favorites.

We were so full! (sushi coma) we had 14 plates ranging from $1-2  and our bill was $31 and some change, with tax, for the both of us. CHEAP! 

anywhere else we would have spent $50 at least.

We go there at least once a week or every other week just to eat there, and we live in Central Phoenix. Its worth the drive for us.",1
trn_4623,"We stopped here for some coffee and a small bite to eat after a day at Carowinds. We waited 25 minutes to get our drinks after ordering. The waitress after finally bringing them to us took our order, and proceeded to go talk to the other employees for 10 minutes before ever entering the orders into the computer. BTW we were the only table she had. While waiting on our food for over half an hour we watched as 4 of the employees attempted a birthday song for the table near us and failed miserably because they didn't know the words and acted like it wasn't important anyway. The restrooms were disgusting, overflowing toilets, trash over flowing onto the floor. They weren't even busy for the hour and a half that we were there. This place is in need of some serious management. I'm not sure how it's still in business.",-1
trn_4624,Bleh!  The only enjoyable part of our meal was the odd couple seated next to us.  But the food was awful.  We've never gone back since.,-1
trn_4625,"Yet another dissappointment in my quest to find Mexican food with soul...

Not far from The Broadacres Swap Meet, we drive towards this big sign that reads"" Las Islitas Mariscos Estillo Nayarit""...The Region of Nayarit, Mexico is well known for their seafood specialities, so we thought
This has gotta be good!

The first good sign-a PACKED parking Lot

We step inside, I'm hoping not to see abuelita upfront making tortillas a mano(fingers crossed)-YES! another good sign....

Instead, tables are packed with the majority being Hispanics(Go where the locals go,right?) and not one, not two, but THREE different bands are going table to table(2 Mariachi bands and 1 Ranchero Band) taking song requests as you dine.

Service staff are hustling in and out of the kitchen with all kinds of seafood specialities trying to get orders to the guests ASAP....We finally get sat at a tiny booth in the corner and I'm eager to see the menu.

So we decide on a mixed seafood Campechana-seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, oysters, and abalone, and a plate of Pulpitos, or sauteed baby octopus as suggested by our waitress.

I guess the dissapointment set in after the first bite. Both dishes looked better than they tasted....the octopus was rubbery from being overcooked.

The Campechana tasted watered down and lacked flavor even with all that seafood inside. we kept having to season it with condiments on our table. Even worse was the unadvertised addition of imitation
crab meat!

Did we order the wrong things? Kitchen have an off day?  Hard to say,but hard to say if this restaurant does Nayarit any justice...ALOHA!!!",-1
trn_4626,"I get the whole ""dicks"" theme that this place is trying to pull off, and that's why I went to check it out. Expecting the staff to be jerks, but funny jerks.  I am not uptight and can take a joke, but the staff was not funny, just mean, arrogant, rude and gave really bad service. First we were ignored at the bar for 11 minutes, then other bartender didn't even know how to make a simple drink! I didn't mind the bartender referred to me as ""titty's"" but I was offended I paid 10 bucks for a half-ass drink!",-1
trn_4627,"This location has poor customer service. We placed an order it was wrong twice when checked in the store.  We ordered 1 chicken cheesesteak and 1 regular cheesesteak. On the third attempt we came home (15 min away) after being reassured it was correct only to find there were two beef cheesesteaks in the bag. We called and the guy that answered appeared not to understand what a chicken cheesesteak was, despite this being on the menu. My husband returned to the store with the order we received, only for the staff to inform him that one was chicken. I think everyone knows the difference between chicken and beef. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location.",-1

It's a buffet at the Rio so it's not the same quality as fine dining but the mini lobster tails are easy to get out of the spines and plentiful. There are crab legs, prime rib, and other buffet type items that can be found at the main buffet which is also phenomenal.",1

trn_4633,"Staying in downtown Phoenix and craving some sushi, we stopped in. We went right at 6pm on a Wednesday night and they were busy and already had a wait! They serve sushi with black rice which is a neat little fun distinction, but I honestly couldn't taste any difference from usual sushi rice. The OhMyGod roll is a definite must and was delicious! The staff are nice but they were like chickens running around with their heads cut off being so busy. It's a little noisy, but overall a great little place.",1
trn_4634,"I have flown with Allegiant several times before. I wouldn't say I was ever very impressed with them but I knew they cut costs to save their customers money and they did their job, getting me from point A to point B. However, the last few times we have flown with them, their prices seem to have skyrocketed while their services seem to have diminished. There are less workers, more delays, and messier planes. The money they are saving by doing this is no longer being passed on to the customers and their workers are being put under more stress, decreasing customer service. 
This wouldn't normally get a one star from me but their incompetence has taken 2 days from my honeymoon. We missed reservations due to delays on our flight to Vegas and spent the last whole day of our honeymoon in an airport instead of by the pool. I think it's safe to say that this will be my last Allegiant flight.",-1
trn_4635,"Ancora is a great little coffee shop down a half a block from capitol square. I came here on a Saturday morning before walking around the Madison Downtown Farmers Market. The line was relatively short, which was good because I was ready for my coffee! I ordered their cold brew with a half shot of their house made mint syrup and a half shot of cream. It's delicious. Not too minty, but just enough to be refreshing, especially on a hot day. 

Ancora makes their own beans, too, which are a regular standby in my house. My favorite are the Ancora D'oro and Black and Tan. The D'oro has a medium body with hints of chocolate and Black and Tan is full bodied with hints of cinnamon. The beans are a little on the pricey side, but the extra couple of dollars is well worth it!!",1
trn_4636,"I effing LOOOOOOVE EBC! Why?! People are running around half naked and having a damn good time. There's nothing to hide here people, it's all hanging out in the open for everyone to see. Whether it's real or fake, jiggly or not jiggly, you'll see it for what it is here.

Pool parties in Vegas are awesome. They are a hella (whoa! i just said hella) good time and I honestly prefer to get chocolate wasted at the pool than at any crowded nightclub in Vegas. Of course when you make a weekend in Vegas, the plan is usually to party all day then party all night. I tend to not make it out 100% alive after a day at the pool, but this past time I managed to do it. 

It was my friend's bachelorette party and we had about 18 girls with us. We all got in for free and partied in a cabana which had a balcony with a great view of the empty lot that was once Stardust. It didn't matter, it was nice to have to place in the shade with couches and free alcohol to drink. Some guys our girls knew had a cabana and allowed all 18 of us to hang out and drink their Goose. I drank in the cabana, partied in the pool, and don't remember much of the walk home. 

EBC is really nice compared to some of the other pool parties I've been too. It's crowded, which is a good thing, but not the point where it's uncomfortable. The pool is clean, the area is clean... I wouldn't expect anything less from a nice hotel like the Encore. We got there at 12 and it was already jam packed so I suggest getting there earlier than that.

Day drinking in Vegas is AWESOME! Even if you don't make it out at night, it's okay. Nightclubs are overrated. Pool Parties are where it's at! ;)",1
trn_4637,"I found an unwanted guest.

Was it on the top of my mound of rice like a loud warning, keeping me from engaging in my mid-evening food fest? Nope. Was it on the side of my meal, preventing me from eating my much anticipated plate? No. No, my fair friends. It was at the very bottom of my bowl of pinto beans. Lurking like a handicapped king prawn. Flattened antennae sprawled across the bowl bottom like wanton wet hair strands. Yes, its languishing frame lay heavy against the white, brown-stained backdrop of my already devoured bowl. That cockroach didn't stand a chance. The weight of several savory legumes, piled up, packed on and sealed in, must have suffocated the bugger. I can only imagine how its death essence must have marinated in my entrails before I swiftly exited the dining room and retreated to the can. 

Upon submitting a formal complaint to the management, I did receive a refund. But sour insult was added to salty injury when I was offered coupons to the same establishment! This was a special kind of face-palmed fail. If you're thinking of taking a trip to this particular Baja Fresh, I would admonish you to reconsider. Save yourself the pain of upchucking your hard-earned money. Go to Chipotle instead. At least there you can see your gourmet goodness made in front of you.",-1
trn_4638,"Everything here was fantastic for brunch on a Saturday! The delicious coffee was served in a cool little cup with free refills. We ordered the Jidori fried chicken and jalapeño cornmeal waffles, salmon with succotash, ahi tuna salad and eggs Benedict pizza. The fried chicken was moist and delicious gravy on the side; the cornmeal waffles were the highlight of the dish. The pizza was out of this world delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with egg and hollandaise sauce on it. The salmon was so moist and perfectly done. The succotash with citrus sauce was an unexpected delight. Even the standard ahi tuna salad was really good. I am looking forward to coming back here again and trying everything!",1
trn_4639,Dang good tacos! I thought it a bit pricey for tacos. Once I tried them though - I knew it was well worth it. Mix and match - one of my buddies didn't realize you can do that so I thought I would mention it. If you are looking for possibly the best tacos in Charlotte - this is the joint!,1
trn_4640,"Visited for lunch on a Saturday morning, July 7, 2012 (sorry, long overdue review!)

Open 24 hours? Check.
""Interesting"" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check.
American-sized portions? America, Fuck Yeah -- CHECK.
Indoor firepit? Check.

As Damon H mentions, the food is ""surprisingly very good.""  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.

The wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)",1

trn_4643,"It pains me to write a rather poor review given that there are so many glowing reviews. I had read the nachos here were incredible, but I have to disagree. Yes, the portion size was absolutely massive, however the cheese wasn't melted and really, the quality of the cheese itself was lacking. When our under cooked nachos arrived, we didn't receive our water we previously requested. No one came back for a solid 10-15 mins, while we waited parched.

trn_4644,"Beau and I did a limo tour our first day in Vegas. It was Friday night and we were sipping on champagne and by 'sipping' i mean we were drinking it straight out of the bottle. Joseph, our driver, took us all over the strip and then down town. We were having such a great time getting to know our surroundings and chatting it up with our driver. He asked us if we wanted to see something really cool. We said ""Yes"". He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices... But like any horror film, against our better judgement, we follow the leader through the back door of the puppymill PEPPERMILL...  we walk in through the back, enter this room filled with fake trees, bright pink couches and pillows and a smoking atmosphere... no, literally... you can smoke in here. There's a beautiful fire pit lounge with blue flames. The waitresses there are dressed in long black gowns and smiling faces. The cocktails are priced well-- the company was established 72 years ago... totally cool feel. It's like you're in an old movie with mobsters relaxing and sipping on gin... except most people are tourists in there. Beau and i didn't order any food, though I've heard it's perfect for late night snacks. Our drinks were great but the atmosphere was awesome. So perfect for the feel of the restaurant. You never would have guessed that the interior would have contrasted to greatly from the exterior. Super cool place. And then we thanked our driver that we got out alive... ;-)",1

Last year while in Vegas we saw KA and liked that quite a bit. I'd rate this slightly below that, but I was never bored for a minute.  There is an incredible amount going on and it's pretty surreal so:

A: Don't expect to ""Understand it.
B: Don't expect to ""See"" everything going on. (It's a circular stadium)

They have a restroom inside the auditorium, which is nice, so you can comfortably get your seat before worrying about finding a restroom.

If you are averse to large crowds you might feel a bit uncomfortable after the show as everyone queues out of the place.

Overall if you are looking for a Cirque show, this one is certainly well worth your attention.",1

Stopped in when we were nearby, hungry, and saw Tott's has a great rating on Yelp!.  Nice restaurant with a good pace of customers and very pleasant staff.  Dessert options were a step above the norm at a small diner like this, which is useful when you have little ones like my wife and I.

Food is good, but not great to my tastes.  The Hot Korean is semi-spicy and would do better with bamboo versus the carrots and more chili pepper.  My wife had the Pepper Chicken (name?) and thought it was tasty enough, but some pieces were warm while others were cool.  Dumplings are not meaty and are more veggie... and the sauce is a sweet vinegar thing that doesn't give much appreciable flavor.  Our daughters thought the Terriyaki Chicken was too dry to finish.

Pumpkin Roll was yummy.  Almond Cookie Cheesecake was left half-eaten as my wife said it tasted more like orange mixed with cheesecake.  I took a bite and have to agree.",0

The chips were thin and crunchy just the way I like them.  We had the fish tacos, chicken tacos and the mini chimis.  We all thought our dinners were delicious.  I had the grilled fish taco and they said it was halibut. It had large chunks of fish as well as avocado.  It came with an awesome sauce to pour over it.  The rice that came with it was equally as delicious.  The black beans that I received with it were a little bland.  

The decor was classy and they had a pretty good happy hour, too.  Service was spot on!   I will definitely be returning!",1
trn_4663,"I had dinner here a few weeks ago, and although it was Ok, it was nothing special.  We were quickly seated by the staff.  This is NOT a 4 or 5 star restaurant - period.  I don't care what other Yelpers say, they tend to over rate places.  There are no white table linens, fine cutlery or service that you will find outstanding.  It's not like Vegas or NYC.  This is a very casual restaurant and you sit literally in the kitchen.  You're not too far from the dishwasher!  You'll see what I mean.

We ordered the home made tagliatelle alla bolognese to be split between us.  It was OK, but unremarkable.  I've had a lot better.  We ordered a dessert, which was good, but I don't see it on the menu now and I can't remember much about it, so it must not have impressed me enough to do so.

Overall, try this restaurant and see how you feel. Others have highly rated it.  I don't see it. Still, it may be worth a try.",-1
trn_4664,"Maybe it was the time of night, or maybe we just caught a bad crew or maybe every one else is super drunk when they done here so it's delicious to them, not sure but our food wasn't good in the least bit. My burger was burnt and dried out and so were my two friends. But, if you check in on yelp and show the bartender, you'll get a free shot...which you'll need if your burger is prepared like mine was. Good luck!",-1

trn_4668,"I finally found a place for Filipino food that's close to the house.  They're a new restaurant and already they're operating well..I'm a fan!

Manila service: It took about 10 minutes to get my #1 combo (chicken bbq sticks) after ordering. All the staff I came across were so friendly and gave a great vibe.  Happy eating time at Manila BBQ.

Manila cuisine:  My chicken bbq sticks were very tasty.  The sauce was savory and it paired well with the red rice and potato salad.  The combo meals are served in a Styrofoam container with a lid which makes it convenient to bring food home. The cashier area has lined with lots of yummy Filipino dessert delicacies already wrapped to go for you.  I see what you did there, excellent. =)

Manila ambiance: A casual open dining area that's very clean with mobile tables in case you need to push them together for a larger group.  The posted menu showcases the combos and prices clearly to make ordering easy.  

If you're familiar with Teriyaki madness, this is the flavorful Filipino version of that for me.  The food is tasty, they pack it ready to go (I'm always on the go) and their price point is similar if not cheaper than Panda Express.  The Filipino desserts offered is icing on the cake.  I'm looking forward to trying more combo dishes but that's another Yelp tale. Enjoy! =)",1
trn_4669,"I really did not like the food that much.  I wanted too, but I did not.   I ordered a big ol' breakfast that came with eggs, grits, biscuits, gravy, sausage, bacon, hash brown casserole  and coffee.  I was with a large crowd and the wait really was not that bad.   My dish came out last and was lukewarm at best.  Everything was OK...'ish and I must have used half the salt and pepper on the table.    I really don't have anything too positive to say about it.  It was like after thought cafeteria meets soup kitchen.   I know they mean well but it's just not my soiree.

Staff was very nice.  Please was clean.   Service was good.  Interior decor was amusing to stare at.  Coffee was good and they gave me a cup-to-go.   All of this was worth an extra star.",-1

Drove in first thing in the morning and although they usually take clients via appointment only, since I didn't know this initially I just drove up to the shop and decided to wait in hopes that 1 of their appointment would cancel.  Sure enough I lucked out and they were able to work on my truck and do a wheel alignment.  Worked out great and truck now drive straight.  They got me in/out within an hour once they got my truck in the shop.  Would use these again in the future.  They know what they're doing and do good work!",1
trn_4671,"When Peanut Butter Jelly Time went in, I was totally stoked.  I love peanut butter and jelly. There is a place just like this in New York City, but the prices are triple so I have never gone. This place is serving some awesome options for your PB&J cravings.

Upon entering I was greeted by the owner. She and her brother run the business together.  Hooray!  They have a family friend who makes the peanut butter and homemade dog treats.  There are tons of flavors of jelly and a variety of toppings. You can get PB&J sushi, Build-Your-Own, Gourmet sandwiches, Grilled cheese, and Cereal.  Nothing here is terribly complicated, which is nice when life is stressful. 

I tested out the Apple Jack Sandwich ($3.25) and Blueberry Yum Yum Roll ($3.75).  My favorite was the roll, which was crunchy peanut butter and blueberry jelly, topped with blueberries and vanilla drizzle. The blueberry jelly was awesome.  This combination was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. The Apple Jack was good too. It was smooth peanut butter, Apple butter, and apple slices on Cinnabon bread. I couldn't really taste the Apple butter, but I liked this sandwich too. It tastes like fall.

I will definitely stop back in on my next trip through Bloomfield. To be honest, I do not know how sustainable the store is since the prices are so low, and rent must be fairly high.  I hope they manage to hang in there!!  I also would love it if they sold their jelly as well.

trn_4673,Not alot to say except the laundromat is clean and priced reasonable. The attnedant was funny and helpful and I appreciate that at 7a. The 40 pond washers are 6 dollars and the drying is free. For some its location in East Cleveland might keep some away but its really a gem.,1
trn_4674,"I'd have to say that Jerry's nugget is a hit or miss casino. I've come to play here a few times and found more losses than wins. One thing that I found  problematic was the difficulty of finding a waitress on the floor. The waitress also would not serve me a drink because I was not playing at that point she finally showed up. I actually was playing, but stopped for a bit. If she was in the vicinity 2 minutes before, she could have watched me lose quite a bit of money. I understand this policy, but other casinos don't seem to have a problem as long as you are tipping the waitress. If I'm going to pay for a drink, I will go to the bar because they will make it better if you pay for it.  They do have a decent variety of games here, but considering the service it's not worth a trip to the shadier part of town.",-1

trn_4678,"I drove to Tuffy Auto Center on Friday, July 25, 2014, and had brakes and tire problems.  It was my first visit there, and I was slightly reluctant to be there.  However, I had been to a dealership beforehand and was not satisfied with the care given to me.  The service advisor was not interested in my car problems and seemed to be more involved with talking to people on the telephone.  I waited too long and then decided to leave.  So my neighbor recommended Tuffy Auto Center at Rocky River Road to me.  I realized at the start that the service advisor was direct and seemed to know his auto business.  Sure enough after an hour's wait my brakes were adjusted, and my tires were inflated properly.  I thought that I needed new tires.  After an honest and thorough job, I will return to Tuffy Auto Centeer and will recommend others to do the same.

Had pecan pie for dessert--outstanding. (Apparently the banana pudding is great too.) The hot homemade biscuits were just like grandmas. The only downside was they were reluctant to give us more than one biscuit. Not sure why. Overall, I'll be back again but may need to bring back-up biscuits.",1
trn_4680,I finally have the time to leave a review for this terrible restaurant. I was at fireside a little bit ago and had the unfortunate luck of ordering the hamburger. What I got was an undercooked mess. I ordered and even reiterated that I would like my hamburger cooked medium and what I got could only be described as well done with a raw center. Only at fireside could you get a burger cooked that defies the law of physics. I am not even sure how it is possible to cook a hamburger both well done and raw at the same time. The waitress did the best she could given the quality of meat and the skills of the cooks. Complaining to the manager was a waste of time and effort. Run away and never look back.,-1
trn_4681,They make the best Veggie Burger I've ever had. You can get it wrapped in cabbage leaves also. Fresh cut Sweet potato fries are good too. Lots of free toppings to choose from. Friendly staff too.,1
trn_4682,"2 stars because the service is too casual for a upscale restaurant and the food is not outstanding for the price. 

i mean to say the servers are not very dignified or well trained. in spite of there poor service i tipped them very well because i am a dignified customer.
Restaurant is clean.
The girls at the front are very helpful.
Nothing much to write about the ambience as nothing is quite exceptional other than beautiful chandeliers all over the places.
Server started to called me buddy, as if we are neighbors. that behavior belongs to smaller restaurants.
I accept i did not order my prime rib right, but the correction made by the server is not professional enough. It's like pointing me out as if i dont know nothing about eating steak.
Food is dropped on our table as if the other side of the restaurant is caught on fire. There is no gentle placement of the food on the table. Again they behave very casually. They should remember we pay for the ambience and service ethics too.
We are party of three people and the table we sat at is quite big. Servers lack minimum common sense to bring in individual sauce cups instead they just left large sauce containers in the middle and we struggled to stretch across the table to dip meat.
I have eaten at so many upscale restaurants so can easily differentiate .

we ordered 3 entrees , i ate Prime Rib and i will review about what i ate.

30% of the prime rib is filled with Fat. i like it but just saying.
Beginning 10 bites are superb and then after chewy part starts. seriously prime rib suddenly turns into a chewing gum.  Not sure why the same experience did not last until the end.
meat dipping sauces (4 different kinds) are so good, i recommend trying them all and stick with what you like the most. I personally liked Peppercorn , Wine based, garlic based sauce. 
Huge Prime Rib portion, i ate 70% and packed 30% for my puppies.
Overall food experience is better than service. 


If you have money, Go ahead give it a try. 
If you experienced fine dining earlier then think before you pick this place. You may not experience similar hospitality .
Try it if you never experienced fine dining earlier , it will help you for comparision purpose.

Thanks for reading my review.",0

We were surprised that some of the dishes were cold because it was so packed; I could understand if it was empty and the carts weren't circulating but every table was full. It took a while to get drinks and other items (napkins). The dishes were not of the same quality as they had been on other visits, but they were acceptable.",0

Robert offered to get the parts but it would take 3 or 4 days.  The car is 26 years old. Ernesto the tech did everything they could to get it to work with what they had. Robert showed me everything they tried to get the convertible to work.  The car was there for 2 about hours.  They could have charged me an arm and a leg but charged me 0 dollars. I was told they would get the parts or I get the parts. Then they could fix it right. I thought they were honest and did everything they could.  Thanks you guys.,1
trn_4686,"I had a very positive experience with BMW of Las Vegas in the course of purchasing a 2018 BMW 540i X-Drive.  My sales person, Paul Reed, and the inventory manager, Cliff Cho, were extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating throughout the process.  And, absolutely no high pressure pitches from either of them.  They have actually stayed in touch after the purchase.  The ""BMW Genius"" who provided my initial training and answers to myriad questions on the new vehicle was Krystel Bockholt, and working with her has been an absolute joy.  There was an issue with my order that caused a delay in receiving my car, but the General Manager, Eric Ziegenbein, intervened on my behalf, and I got a 2018 vehicle for the same price as I had been quoted for the 2017 model.  I would highly recommend BMW of Las Vegas for anyone considering the purchase of a new BMW.

Records: Great stuff that you never see at very reasonable market prices. Also, the records are cleaned by a sonic cleaner- I didn't even have to nitty-gritty them once I got home because they were cleaner than they ever will be again lol. 

Staff: The store owner is super friendly and very knowledgeable- he did a wonderful job putting together the ideal shop. 

Extra's: Sells inner sleeves, outer sleeves, spin clean machines, high to medium end turntables and audio equipment 

Selection: Off the chain- tons of great 60's-90's collectible records as well as current in print 180g records at great prices.",1

Their stuffed jalapeños and their ceviche my favorite by far! I visited this place a couple times now.

Went next door to Humble Pie and the guy at the front said they shut down January 1st. My heart sank. This is the second Sushi joint that has closed in the past few months. Ten on Tatum was equally amazing and had great food. Sad day when great sushi bars close because the chains get more business, even if their overpriced food sucks.",1
trn_4697,I came here as a kid once and remember not being impressed but as an adult Wolfgang Puck holds some meaning since he is a world renowned chef. Unfortunately it was another negative for me. The shisito peppers were good but there were more mushrooms than peppers in the app. The pizza was dry and terrible. I ate almost none of it. The group I was with got more traditional pizza and seemed to like it although my mother's crab cakes were almost miniature in size and that was strange. Pizza-wise... It seemed like there was a lot of food but not a lot of quality. It was blah in flavor and dry in texture. Sorry WP I am unimpressed again.,-1

A lot of adults there drinking, and they had no kids playing in he play area. Empty beer cans in the sand. People in the parking lot drinking, playing loud music.

They have a great reputation in Pittsburgh, and after 5 years in this city, it was about time I see what all the fuss is about. Although I will never experience one of their famous Pepperoni Rolls (being a vegetarian has its downfalls), I figured the next best thing was the Spinach & Feta Roll.  It turned out to be a huge letdown. Aside from tasting a bit old and dry, it could have used a lot more filling. The marinara dipping brought it up a notch, but I don't understand why they must charge an extra $0.75 for half a scoop of marinara that clearly came out of a $1 jar. The real killer was the unevenly baked bread. There were corners where it was just RAW DOUGH. Why Mancini's?!

trn_4717,"They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.

The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.

All the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).

I wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the ""shrimp sauce"" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I'm stoked they're here.",1

We ordered a few pizzas (one hand tossed..remember that!) some sides and a soda. Showed up 10 minutes after projected ready time to give them a little leeway. Was told our order was in the oven and should be ready in less than ten minutes. No problem! I don't mind waiting, stuff happens. 10 minutes later I'm told it's ready... I wait for another 5 minutes while the employee disappeared. I'm assuming he was getting my order together as it clearly wasn't ready. Finally I received my food and was on my happy way home. Keep in mind I live a short 2.5 miles away from this location and drove straight home. Our food was COLD, and both my pizzas were pan style. Now, why was I told my food wasn't ready but yet when I received it, it was cold?  We tried to call and speak with a manager but after 20 minutes of listening to the employees speak amongst each other and take orders (they never even put me on hold, more or less just laid the phone down).

The waitress was ok but didn't clear the dishes or refill drinks without being asked. As for the cleanliness, the place was a mess. There was a huge mess on the floor below our table where a family of 8 had all of their kids before us and no one thought to sweep under the table or wipe the chairs before sitting a new group. The rest of the restaurant was no better, including the bathrooms. Blah! If that is what we could see, imagine what we couldn't see in the kitchen!",-1
trn_4722,Mike Steele makes this place awesome! Drinks taste amazing and his personality makes me want to come back over and over. Thanks guys !,1
trn_4723,"We loved the old place, Il Nido, but this is a fantastic transition. The place is small so reservation is a must. They are new so still working out some kinks. 

We split 3 things. Beet salad, the cheese ravioli and the lamb chops. All 3 were amazing. 

The big negative I had here was the service. It took FOREVER. I think they have a small staff and a small kitchen, however you would also think with a small number of tables you would have a lot of attention. Not the case. So if you do go, plan on at least a 2 hour dinner.

The food is amazing, just be prepared to wait.",1
trn_4724,"I had their chicken shwarama plate delivered via uber eats.  The portions aren't the greatest, and the quality of the food wasn't the best.  It's like they didn't trim the fat off the meat.  I was a bit disappointed.  Never ordering again",-1
trn_4725,"2-3 years ago I found LifeScape Medical Associates randomly and started going there since then. Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.

There're a few reasons I don't like it there:
1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.

2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.

3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. 

I normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.",-1

trn_4728,"This is a fun place to shoot pool and play ping pong, but the service is shabby.  I had to wait forever to order a drink and the bartender wasn't very personal.  However, I went on a crowded Saturday night.  If I went again I would go on a weeknight, so I could participate in some of the games outside.  There is a cute little cabanaesque bar outside on the patio, I would recommend going outside because it is much less congested.  Not only that, the guys who hang out around the pool table are kind of pushy and not really people friendly.  I did get a chance to meet the owner towards the nights end and he was very approachable, and seemed to care about his guests.  Overall, my experience was decent, but a little too frat-tastic for my taste.",0

trn_4731,"This place is amazing! I've been looking for a cheap, good sushi place in Arizona for the past 2 years I've lived here. Coming from Los Angeles with places like Sushi Mac and other inexpensive but yummy choices, I was a bit spoiled. 

Now I'm even more spoiled! The most expensive plate here is $2! I never even found prices that cheap in L.A. where you have sushi places on just about every other corner. Plus, this place is good! Sure, its no fine dining establishment so the quality is not top-of-the-line, but its BY FAR much, much better than store bought sushi, and again, cheaper.

I recommend this place to anyone who, like me, loves sushi but doesn't want to break the bank.",1

trn_4733,"They have a 5 star rating for lots of reasons!  I brought my jeep here based on a recommendation.  I wanted to find a locally owned comprehensive automotive repair shop that I could trust.  Dealership prices are ridiculous and the chains - I just don't trust because of the upsell pressure.  

Gino's has been in business for 32 years and there are multiple generations working in the shop.  I went in for basic maintenance but I wanted to get a quote on some other things that were wrong (and find out what they were).  The prices are reasonable, they are exceptionally knowledgeable, honest, helpful and friendly.  There is an occasional awful noise that I didn't know if it was my shocks or something loose.  It was the shock on the right.  They gave me a good quote to fix.  I asked them if it was safe for another 6 weeks - they told me 'sure, no problem'.  It was just one shock but they told me they replace in pairs because if one is going so is the other.  It's been about a week and now I can here the left shock starting to squeak.  It's not exactly convenient to where I live but I will go the extra miles to take my jeep to a shop that knows what they are doing and will tell me the truth.",1
trn_4734,"Not terrible, but not up to par either. Beer selection was great. Although, I don't know that I've ever visited a tap haus with Guiness on tap but not Bass. They attempted a black and tan and failed. The appetizers were okay. Salad, tap haus, was bland. We ordered the daily special to split. They apparently were kind hearted and replaced our order with a semi-charred steak instead. They had run out of the fish special which wasn't helpful to my vegetarian wife. The steak was okay. I would have never ordered it otherwise - this isn't Durrant's. The side items were mostly cold and somewhat bland. 
The beer selection saves this place but the food needs some help.",0
trn_4735,"If you have a craving for some Chinese food, come here. I like this place because it's one of the few Chinese restaurants on the strip that comes kind of close to tasting like it. And the price is reasonable considering where it is. Everytime I come here( I go to vegas 2 to 3 times a year), I've always had fast service. Of course it won't be as good as the restautants in the SF Bay Area though.

I know they have some other 'non-Chinese' things here like sake but they have mostly Chinese dishes. This is what I ordered the last time I was there: 
Hot and Sour Soup(kind of spicy but I like spicy)
Red Won Tons(kind of plain but not bad)
Spicy Beef Tripe(this was good although I wish it warm, didn't know it was a cold dish)
Si Jiu Beef(this was good)",1
trn_4736,"When looking for a new place to try I always try to scope out the menu before going.  The menu at Ling & Louie's has some awesome looking items on it.  When we first entered the restaurant there were no employees around to greet us.  It was initially confusing on whether we had to seat ourselves or wait for a host/hostess.  Finally someone walked up and greeted us and took us to our seats.  The server was pleasant and explained the restaurant well.  We ended up ordering the hand-wrapped potstickers, lettuce wraps, new wave pad thai, and miso soup.  I also had a ginger-lime margarita and 22oz Ling's lager.

The food was EXTREMELY disappointing.  The potstickers were by far the best of the items we ordered.  The lettuce wraps (not the lettuce) and the pad thai tasted so strongly of GAS from the wok that it was very difficult to swallow.  The pad thai was lacking flavor and spice and was just so overpowered by gas from the wok that any other flavors it may have had were unnoticeable.  This goes for the lettuce wraps as well; the lettuce they use is fine, however the chicken mix they wok'd was so gassy tasting that my wife struggled to finish it as well.  The miso soup was equally terrible as it was full of thin stringed seaweed.  Miso soup should not have more seaweed than liquid.  It was awful.

To top it off, I ordered my 22oz lager in hopes of having something to wash down the gas after-taste we were suffering through.  I received my beer 16 MINUTES after ordering it, and the bar was NOT busy, as this was a Wednesday night.  That to me is just unacceptable.  Drinks should be the quickest and easiest thing to get customers.

This restaurant receives 2 stars for good potstickers, and a good margarita, subpar overall service, and lackluster food.  If you like your wok'd food tasting primarily like GAS then this is the place for you!  Just not for us..",-1

I've read that others use this to get closer to the shopping on either side of these two hotels and that makes sense too.  When you're on the tram make sure you look towards the strip for an overhead shot of the sure to be crowded TI pool.  Glad we weren't trying to visit that one!

trn_4739,"Vocelli's is one of my fave stops when I visit my sis in Moon. We ordered the garlic spinaci, a tasty mix of garlic,spinach and cheeses. The Vocelli crust is a thing of beauty, chewy where it needs to be, crunchy around the edges.

Service is very consistent here, our pizza arrived in about 35 minutes. The driver mentioned that occasionally the store doesn't get the online orders right away, or it would have been here sooner. 

Knowing this we might call next time, versus using the online ordering system. Still a reasonable amount of time to wait for an excellent pie.",1

It's one of the better Monte Cristos that I've had.  I also like their chessesteak sandwich.  Be sure to ask for this with jalapenos for an extra kick.  Also of note is the spinach artichoke dip, which is mostly cheese with some spinach and artichoke in it, but that's probably why I like it.  People who've had the burgers say they're very good.

Then they'll give you your car back unwashed and claim they didn't wash it because ""you seemed to be in a rush."" Great....next couple of times I tried to make appointments and get a confirmation number, I am told they don't make appointments. Yet every time I drive up they ask if I have an appointment? Do you make appointments or not?? I guess it doesn't matter since they'll tell you they have no record of it.

Decided to try here on a Monday night with JW. There were actually still people waiting for table when we left. Imagine the weekends... packed like sardines in a small, stuffy, charcoal filled environment. No, thanks!

Ordered the lamb, beef and garfish to share. They served the skewers on a heated platform over candles... I thought the presentation was pretty neat :) 

The flavour was spot on but it gets a bit boring when all the food had the SAME spice rub taste. I would love more variety... maybe a good dipping sauce to go along? The lamb and beef tasted exactly the same... just that the lamb was more tender. I'd come back just for the lamb skewers. Garfish was crispy, the meat was soft and tender... but I have had better ones at Oriental Gourmet.

We did wait close to an hour from our first lamb skewers to the remaining orders. Now I understand why it is called Chat Bar. JW and I literally chatted for 45 mins to an hour before the food came lol.

We almost refused to pay tips for the minimal service. The waitstaff were courteous and friendly... but we had to fetch our own drinks from the beer/pop fridge in the front counter and open it ourselves. They charge you after you consume. Bottled water is complimentary. It is a nice feature where it makes you feel like home... I might as well just fetch my food too? Our tips should solely be for the hardworking kitchen staff, sniffing charcoal all day IMO.

I would come back for lamb skewers takeout. I know it is overpriced ($5.95/4 pcs) but you gotta do what you gotta do when your craving hits lol.

P.S. Brush up your mandarin before coming here! You'll need it.",0
trn_4755,"I wish I could give this place no stars. I was traveling to Phoenix from Houston. When I originally called I was excited about how cheap it was going to be to rent a car for me, my husband and our two kids. I was told it would be $189 + $50 to rent a car seat for the 6 days we were in town. While we were at the airport I called to let them know we were there and I wasn't sure where to go to get picked up, I was told a driver would come and get our family and bring us to the location. So I grabbed our bags and we headed outside. I guess while I was dealing with frontier losing our stroller; the shuttle guy (who came from a different company in a Tony Uber like car) told my husband he was going to circle around and come back for us. Well once I heard that I called the driver back and was informed we needed to call the office. So I did, the guy on the phone was crazy rude from the second he picked up. I was scolded for not having my children and I at the curb immediately and that since we missed our ride we would have to pay out of our own pocket to get taxied to their location. I was very confused about all of this and asked if we did indeed get an Uber, would they provide some sort of discount since we were assured at booking they had a shuttle for us. Once I brought up the discount the guy on the phone started screaming at me, called me a brat and basically fired me as a customer. My day was already stressful enough and who I'm assuming is the owner made it much worse and brought me to tears in the airport. My husband was furious and decided to call the owner himself and was told that our money was no good there and  we were basically pieces of shit as people because we missed our ride due to the damn airport (totally out of my control). These people are beyond rude. Do yourself a favor and read the reviews. We ended up going through Alamo and were upgraded to a super nice SUV and a free car seat all because some other company (Phoenix car rental) literally destroyed our day and vacation.",-1

looks unassuming from the outside as well as from the inside (front area). But when you go sit down get ready to be blown away by a gorgeous large raw edge massive table for communal dining! As well as smaller tables for 2 as well as 4 people. 

I ordered the hot pot chicken coconut broth with noodles (also had a few chunks of pineapple to balance out the spice). It was delicious on a cold day in march. Although something was missing, the flavors did not quite balance out. The pieces of chicken were a good size and quite a few chunks which was a treat. I didn't love the noodles in the soup but there weren't too many. 

I also ordered the free range chicken wrap with sweet potato. I asked for mine to be spicy. It was really tasty. Together the soup and wrap were very filling.

But even then the execution wasn't great. The turkey panini was flat grilled on dry bread so it crumbled as you picked it up.  The flavor of the bruschetta was good but again the execution made it hard to eat. The bread was sliced but the toppings were put on after.  Standard flatware isn't sharp enough to cut through prosciutto so I destroyed it trying to serve it to my table mates.

David came out the next day with multiple samples to choose from.  Not only did he take the chairs that day, but returned them within the week and they looked great.  David provided excellent customer service, was knowledgable and reasonably priced.  Would highly recommend.",1
trn_4777,"I was in the area and wanted sushi so, I came here. It's a very small place that can only seat about 20-30 people. I love the display in their glass counter once you walk in. Totoro, sushi and Lego Yoda - these are a few of my favorite things. When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm fee...

They have specials on the board behind the sushi bar. Their items are ala carte. Sorry, AYCE fans.

Uni Trio:
Uni in a spoon, uni dumpling and uni handroll. If you like uni, you'll appreciate having uni served three ways. The uni was of good quality. 5/5

Buffalo Oyster:
Fried oysters tossed in sweet and sour kochujang on a bed of greens. The oysters were tender and not overly fried. The sauce that coated them was a bit spicy and tangy, and quite interesting. 3/5

Salmon Poke Tacos:
Chunks of salmon with mango jalapeno, red onion, red tobiko and sesame seeds. This was refreshing. They sell poke taco platters! 4/5

Warm Springs Roll:
Spicy soft-shell crab, cucumber, avocado, and eel sauce. The soft-shell crab was chopped up and I didn't like that too much. 3/5

XXX Roll:
Soft-shell crab, spicy tuna, spicy crab, shrimp tempura, rice paper, avocado, eel sauce, sriracha, and spicy yum sauce. No rice. The rice paper made it a bit difficult to get from the plate - each piece was sticking to the next piece or the plate. But was it good? Why, yes! It was a bit sweet and a lot spicy. 4/5

Cherry Blossom:
Crab meat wrapped with salmon, no rice. I love non-rice options since I don't enjoy rice at all. 4.5/5

Monaka Ice Cream:
Green tea ice cream with a layer of red bean paste inside a wafer. A dessert that isn't too sweet. Easy to eat and isn't messy. 4/5

My cup of hot water for my green tea was never empty. This place is bright and just delightful!",1
trn_4778,"Do not come here. My group and I did not like the experience here at all. First, we didn't get our waters even after we asked twice. I had to flag one waiter down again just to make sure we got them. They charged us $14 for a combo of  roast pork and chicken, and the plate was small! The fried rice was mediocre at BEST. The tea was not great and our server should not have been given a tip but this place automatically adds the tip to your final bill. What kind of restaurant does that? Never coming back here.",-1
trn_4779,"The Jade Red chicken is literally all you need in life.

Love this place. Such a unique idea! I've been coming here since I was little to the Chandler location and I'm super bummed that it closed :(

Such a cool opportunity to combine two cultures. Definitely one of the most woke restaurants.

trn_4782,"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",-1

trn_4785,"**********TACO TUESDAY*********

My first ever Taco Tuesday was here.  Went with a LOT of rowdy people and the place was seemingly cool with the huge loud crowd, and even was able to seat us (I'm talking like 50 people).

I got a meal #27, don't remember exactly what it was but it included tacos and beans and was pretty epic-tasting.  The meal combo seemed so perfect that all of my friends got the #27 and loved it just as much.  However, my friend Greg did not get the #27 and was temporarily shunned for doing so. 

The chips are epic, as was the salsa and the interior decor.  

Also epic are their margaritas (and from what I remember, cheap too).  There is a seperate bar area you can go to get away from your crowd and order drinks.  Bar is especially cool because there are pictures of el guapo and wooden ships to look at while you order/drink.  

Cabs were ready and willing to take us back to the strip after we were finished eating.  I rode with chuckyhacks and it was fun.

I'm subtracting 3 stars because of one of their shtty workers. He checked me out on terminal 592 at 1:48 on 7/10/2014 (this info is for the manager of the store in the event that he'd/she'd like to check on which worker I'm referring to). I had a screw driver, some screws, and a roll of gaffing tape. After he gave me the total, I decided I didn't want to pay the $26 for the tape roll. He gave me the biggest sigh and said ""are you kidding me? god damn it. jesus."" I honestly could not believe this guy. Whoops! My bad. Is voiding out a line item the end of your world? What a complete mother effer. 

Side note... I wonder what the limit of profanity on yelp is...

trn_4788,The best Southern food you could eat. I suggest fried chicken combo of your choosing! You can't go wrong,1
trn_4789,"High end food + rustic chic décor + blackboard menu + small room + dim lighting = a successful formula. Many of Montreal's most successful and trendy restaurants follow this precise code - think Garde Manger, Joe Beef, Bremner, Club Chasse et Pêche, L'Orignal and yes, Liverpool House.

Don't get me wrong - I love the formula. Just because something becomes popular doesn't mean it should be dissed. I'm not that kind of person. I love Britney Spears.

Liverpool House was one of the few restaurants that began this trend in Montreal. Clearly, it did so successfully. One of the best things about these ""rustic chic"" places is that they re quite casual but still focused on the haute, and that they welcome a certain ""older"" crowd. You know wont be annoyed by loud 19-year olds fête-ing their unfortunate halter-top wearing friend's birthday because of the slightly higher price point. Liverpool House, thank you for existing.

There's something undeniably charming about walking into a small space where RSVP's are difficult to come by, being welcomed as if you were entering a friend's Hamptons' home, and sitting down at an unpretentious wooden table set with a plaid serviette. The blackboards and framed pictures adorning the walls just add to the atmosphere, and the soft lighting makes the good-looking people this place attract even better looking. Really? Yeeeah, really.

I loved everything that contributed to my experience at Liverpool House. Our waiter was supernice and supercute, knew the (new!) menu well, and timed the services perfectly. My friend and I split the braised lamb cavatelli ($11) to start. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the lamb was soft and very flavourful.

Next, we had the infamous lobster spaghetti with bacon and tomato sauce ($49) and the scallops with braised pork belly, lentils and fried egg ($34). Both were insane. The spaghetti had huge chunks of lobster (way more than you would think) and a slightly smoky flavour from the bacon. It was a huge portion, enough for two actually.

The scallops were some of the best I've ever had. Overcooked scallops are an obvious faux-pas, but I also really dislike undercooked scallops. In my opinion, they should be raw (tartar, ceviche) or cooked (pan seared, grilled) - none of that awkward middle ground that results in a warm but raw mess on your plate. Liverpool House's scallops were incredibly tender and cooked to the perfect point - not the least bit chewy. The pork belly was as delicious as ever, and the egg and spiced lentil puree brought everything together beautifully. Sounds weird, but it was flawless.

We decided to finish our meal with the House's parfait ($11). Real crème fouettée, caramelized apples and white sponge cake in a jar, topped with caramelized pecans. Sounds unspectacular, but each part of the dessert had a finesse to it. It really was delicious. My dessert fiend friend was floored. (Tongue twister, anyone?)

And finally, let me address one last thing that I've heard mentioned too many times. Many say Liverpool House is pretentious and has a too-cool-for-school attitude, but I really don't think so. I think that those who call it pretentious are the ones who weren't prepared for the restaurant's price point (even though it's totally justified by the quality of its dishes) or those who tend to feel self-conscious in trendy places. Yes, this place is ""hot"", but everything about it lives up to the hype. So relax and take pleasure in its unaffected vibe. Don't overthink things. Just go and enjoy... It's a foodie must.

trn_4793,"I've been hearing about Paint Nite for about a year now, so I was excited to finally attend.  This is a fun activity to do with friends and family.  Here's what I liked:

1. Everything was well organized, down to the apron, the paints, and all is setup for you in advance.
2. The host has a PA system, so everyone can hear well.
3. The host was very positive, encouraging everyone to be creative and have fun.
4. The painting was broken down into methodical steps so everyone succeeded.
5. It's a great way to meet new people and to socialize with your friends.
6. It's FUN!

There are different instructors and venues.  I went to Getaway Cafe and the staff there was very welcoming and the food was good.  Our instructor had a degree in Art, and she took the time to explain how to complete the painting in easy steps.

Nobody at Paint Nite paid full price, they all got their tickets through Groupon.  Not sure how long Groupon will sell the half price tickets, but if you use the code PITTSBURGH you can bypass the Groupon website.",1

The waffles are a perfect blend of crisp and soft with interesting and creative varieties that will have you coming back. They offer gluten free on certain menu items so be sure to ask. The coffee drinks look tasty but they are definitely cheat meal status.  Luckily it was mine today hence the banana/Nutella waffle, the pizza tasting waffle and the bacon and eggs sandwich waffle.  Shared amongst two adults and a toddler,  of course. Not to mention the two kale chocolate chip cookies,  two July 4th inspired sugar type cookies, blueberry muffin and an all vegan mini Nutella cake type thingy.  Did I mention it was my cheat day?

This time I opted for a steak burrito.

I was a little disappointed that they didn't have or were out of pastor/pork, I really liked my pork taco last time I was in.

This time was a little better, the burrito was better than the taco I got last time. The steak on this burrito was actually steak, and not ground beef, so that was an improvement.

Unfortunately the burrito comes at a cost of $7. I think this is too expensive. For $7 I think I could get not only more food, but better quality food at Chipotle or for even less money, Maize.

Feeling a little bloated, instead of eating a huge breakfast this morning; I decided to start my day with a bowl of superfood Acai bowl, and a glass of toxic flush instead. 
You hear a lot about the supposed health benefits of a cleanse or detox, designed to eliminate toxins from our body.  There are claims, but not sure if they are entirely valid since they are low in protein. But the good thing is there is benefit from increased intake of vitamins and minerals either naturally from juiced fruits and veggies or supplemented from drinks. I was feeling a little sluggish this morning, so the girl behind the counter suggested the Toxic flush. I decided to try it, and I must say it was pretty good. It also actually made me full, so I took the Acai bowl to go.  The toxic flush juice has an apple, spinach, parsley, lemon and ginger which I can probably make at home.",1

I've said it.  It's out in the open.  But truly, get your act together and act like a professional.

Regardless, the VH Spa isn't a dream spa,  It's small, but it gets the job done.

trn_4817,"I spent a month doing a medical school rotation in Twinsburg, and to my good fortune, was treated to Chipotle on a semi-regular basis.  You know what to expect from a Chipotle, and while the company has lost some of its luster in recent years and I don't love it as much as I did in my college days, this location never did us wrong.  Online orders were usually slower than anticipated, but we never had a problem with accuracy.  Everything always tasted fresh.  The queso is mediocre; save that order for a Moe's.  You already know the menu, I'm sure, but I'm personally partial to steak tacos on crispy corn tortillas, chicken burrito bowls, and vegetarian burritos (because let's face it, the guac's probably what I'm craving anyway).

I lived in Dallas before moving here and would pay $15 for this same thing (maybe even better quality) exterior and interior. So I thought it was a bit pricey, but this may be average for the area, not sure. My car looked nice when it was done, but they didn't wash the windows on the inside and didn't wipe the dash inside. Service was pretty good, I spoke to a man inside who may have been the manager, who was super nice. Most everyone else was friendly as well, except for one guy vacuuming who was a little rude (maybe he was just having an off day? Who knows).

trn_4823,"I haven't been a member of this gym for very long, but, I have been a member of several gyms and this so far tops them all by miles.  

Other than the crowd at peak hours, which of course is usually the only time I'm able to work out, you really couldn't ask for much more out of a gym.  The women's locker room alone is enough to rant and rave about! With tons of room, a separate work out area, and spa you don't even have to leave the locker room to have a good experience at this gym.  I like it because I am able to stretch and warm up before I go out onto the main floor.  My only complaint about the locker room is that some women are a little too comfortable there. If you want to sit around naked reading a book or magazine please do that at home! I guess that's what happens when the locker room is a ""cozy"" environment. 

To add, the free weight area is HUGE and I love the hybrid machines, as well as the nautilus section.  I hardly ever see broken down equipment and besides the occasional wait for a machine, you really couldn't ask for much more! 

My favorite thing about this gym is the classes.  I am the type of person that is much more motivated in a class setting and I love the atmosphere and extra push.  They have so much variety, and many times to pick from which is very helpful! My favorite class is spin, followed by Athletic Conditioning which both leave me feeling ""cleansed"" and soaked in sweat.  

All in all I am very pleased with this gym, and would recommend anyone to go there! :)",1
trn_4824,"Baa, baa, black sheep, (Jen k and Wayne arrange for a lamb focused UYE)
Have you any wool? (After a debate we set the date) 
Yes, sir, yes, sir, (12 Yelpers agree to partake)
Three bags full; (How we felt after the UYE) 
This UYE was arranged to coincide with the Year of the Ram. As always amazing effort to arrange such an event. 
We went all out with the menu. So here is the verdict on each dish.
Fried Lamb Tongue a more exotic dish for some I guess though we we stayed away from the Vday special. Decent I would order this for the texture as it was done well. 
Fresh Lamb Soup. Hmm couldn't make much of it a filler IMO.
Sliced Lotus Roots. A good version of lotus root. Even though its pan fried I think its a good way to change the taste of the lamb.
Spicy Cabbage. Again done quite well. For a place that's known for lamb they do veggies quite well. 
BBQ Lamb Chop. Excellent the top item IMO for this outing. Cooked to perfection with crisp out and nicely rendered fat. The dry spice also elevated this dish.  
Lamb Slice Skewer. Intense and looks like a big serving but it is laden with cumin. I would rather order the BBQ lamb skewers as they feel you more satiated. 
BBQ Lamb Skewers. For a place that is known for lamb it would be terrible for them to get this item wrong. They do this quite well. I would say its a crowd pleaser
Sesame Lamb Chop.  This version of the chops didn't quite sit right. Quite bland IMO. The dipping sauce didn't add much to the meat as it stayed bland. IMO lamb meat benefits from being spiced well so this one was downer.
Big BBQ Lamb Leg: Big on presentation a huge hunk of was brought carved and drew ooh and aah from the table. Cooked just right so the meat was tender. The meat was spiced well so a good thing to order if you are a big crowd. There is an option bring it whole so one can carve it on the table. 
Lamb Pancakes. Decent and fulfilling. 
Beef dumplings. Average as just boiled and not spiced. 
Lamb Dumplings: Average. 
Rice. Had raisins in it which provided a nice surprise. 
My recommendations are order the leg of lamb, BBQ lamb chop if you are a medium sized group and balance out the rest of the meal with other items.
I would say a 3 star for moi and would bump it up another star if you are into lamb.",0
trn_4825,"I had lunch at the buffet and it was by far the best buffet I've had in Vegas to date (I've travelled here quite often). The choices at lunch time are a bit overwhelming as they had full breakfast choices with omlette station, sushi bar, meat carving station, pastas, deserts, and the list goes on and on. My only dissappointment was that I could not eat more.  Best $20 buffet/variety you can have on the Strip.",1

Came to check out the Van Gogh-Alive exhibit, and what a great way to spend $25!  The average exhibit-goer takes about 45 minutes to go through the exhibit, which includes 5 to 10 minutes of ""reflection"" in the second room, where you may look at pictures and descriptions regarding Van Gogh's life and specific artworks, so do make a note of this.  Had we had more time to spend, my cousin and I would've stayed for at least a couple of hours... The music, Van Gogh's letters, and the beauty of the digital presentations captivated us so!  

I did find the benches, placed in a haphazard fashion, to be very distracting.  They broke the flow of energy in the room and kept me from being able to move about freely as I wanted to, and the benches' marred my visual field as I looked across the room.  This observation was again confirmed when I found a great YouTube vid that showcased the Istanbul presentation of this exhibit, which did not contain benches in the room.  (Now, I do not mind having somewhere to sit.  Indeed, there were lovely fabric and leather couches in this exhibit, and thankfully, they were by the walls.)  I also noticed that the Turkish exhibition suggested the room to have a larger dimension that that of Az Sci Center's.  I found its exhibit's dimensions seemed more open and had a better flow.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ACUNyN_Ec&feature=related

I would definitely recommend people to check this presentation out!  I would love to re-visit this viewing, but perhaps in another city...

p.s.  The exhibit's $25 fee includes admission to the rest of the exhibits within AZ Science Center.  Please note that the Van Gogh exhibit can only be entered and exited once, and that it runs through June 17, 2012.",1

trn_4830,"You know that place where families want to get together once a year to have a family reunion, Ginger Beef House is that place for a variety of Chinese cuisine.

Apparently, this is the place my dad's favorite dish is, or what he grew up liking. A quant and family oriented place, Ginger Beef House has some good dishes for a Chinese experience, but is grounded to look like the restaurant it is. At least it's clean in there and has OK service. 

We got a variety of dishes, and it basically blends with your experience. The gathering of families talking about their lives, you talking about your own trying to impress them that you're not living under a rock. The foods tastes about the same.

 Think about the Chinese food you've had, this place is the same. There's mushu duck which comes with cucumbers and onions and hoisin sauce, pretty common, but pretty delicious with a great combination with the Peking duck. There's lobster if you want to feel fancy, but way over priced for that kind of restaurant. The main show was the ginger beef, which is really a better version of orange chicken as it has that same crispy consistency, but a better sauce of course. A sweet and tangy sauce made up of soy sauce, ginger, garlic and chili sauce makes the dish savory and sweet great to munch on with some plain rice or not so special fried rice. Throw in some random vegetable dish such as bok choy or garlic green beans and your set for a traditional Chinese meal with your family.",0

FAST! Dropped off my truck, which only had a small dent in the passengers side front door, right at my scheduled time & it went smoothly & quickly. I was given an initial ETIC of 2-3 days for a possible completion of Friday of that week, but might be early the next week, depending on extent of the damage. I wasn't in a hurry & didn't need a rental car. They actually called Thursday to let me know if I could make it in after work Friday, it would be ready for me & if not, Saturday was ok, too. I made it out of work & over there just before they closed before the weekend hit. I paid my deductible & was out the door.
They washed my truck & even cleaned the interior, which included vacuuming out all my hair! (I admit, I shed).
Chris, the service rep & Spencer, the Geico rep and all the staff I came in contact with were so nice & it looks to me like the techs did an AWESOME job, and FAST, too!

trn_4840,"So, after our last big rain - what do you know, we found a couple of termite tubes out on the back patio.  We hadn't had the house serviced since we had it treated for termites when it was built (over 13 years ago).  Anyhoo - I jumped on YELP to see if I could find a termite company to compare to our current pest control servicer (we have the house and yard sprayed for bugs every 6 months or so).  HDE had some great reviews.  I wanted to use a local company to keep more of our tax dollars in our state.  
I called them up and David came out at a time convenient for us.  We already had a first quote from another termite company, so we had something to base it off of.  David provided us a quote on the spot.  He was comparable in price, but did a whole lot more explaining of what the process was and how the chemicals worked.  I worked in a termite inspection company in Calif - so I was familiar with alot - and he still wowed me with how he explained it in terms both me and my husband understood.  We gave David the head nod that we would use his service.  His office emailed the docs over for signature and away we went.
David's guys came out and took care of our home.  They were quick and professional.   No termites since!  Thanks HDE",1

Really more of a Vietnamese Fusion if thats what you want to call it.  If you know and love authentic Vietnamese cuisine then this will not cut it. We had gone strictly because were meeting a celebration party and the group had decided on this restaurant. We all settled on a prefixed menu at $40 per person. Starts with Edamame with a delicious seasoning. Then it starts to go down hill. Some kind of a papaya mango salad that was too spicy and soggy! Almost everyone (11 out of 15) said the same. Next was sliced beef with stale shrimp chips! The beef was tasty but all the accompanying green salad and shrimp chips were again soggy. Then imperial rolls that were supposed to be wrapped in lettuce leafs for dipping. The lettuce, mint leaves, and cilantro had seen better days. Instead if being fresh crisp lettuce it looked like they had been sitting out and wilted. The main dishes of 2 shrimps and some pork in a pad thai was  overcooked and way too soft! 3 other couples said the same thing. The Salmon was the last on the service and that was not bad. 
The meal took so long to come out it was 3.5 hours into the night and it was 11 pm. Desert was supposed to be part of the meal but when we asked they told us the kitchen was closed! Not impressed with the meal so far everyone just went with the flow and said our fair wells!
All in all if you want a $$$""hipster Vietnamese fusion"" experience and you're not fussy about eating ""mushy"" Pad Thai then you picked the right place! Our bill came out to $115.00 with a diet coke! Seriously this is way too much for what we got.",-1

trn_4850,"This large AYCE place is sort of like Todai meets PF Chang's. 

It is located in the Place Longueuil shopping mall on the South Shore off St. Laurent, not too far from the Pont Jacques-Cartier. 

Todai is known in California for it's all you can eat sushi in mass quantities, buffet style. PF Chang's, that Scottsdale, AZ HQ'd Chinese chain, is known for its large faux statues. Sushi Palace combines these. 

The place is very large, seating over 100 people, maybe up to 200 if you used every seat. The space has high ceilings and is airy, with large columns covered with ancient Chinese calligraphy, and above the sushi counter and kitchen, large Buddha statues on the upper half of the wall. These are not Japanese looking Buddhas, but skinnier Chinese looking ones. Nonetheless, they add to the PF Chang likeness of the massive horses they use in front of those faux Chinese eateries. 

And speaking of faux, this is faux Japanese, as it is owned and staffed with Chinese. And although it is an AYCE place, it is not a buffet. You sit, get a waiter, order off little sushi or other item check lists, and they go order it for you from the cooks/chefs under the Buddhas. 

They do have a large selection and variety of foods. They carry most common Nigiri sushi items (except Uni and other more exotics), and some sashimi as well. And they offer other popular Japanese dishes like Yakitori au Boeuf and Tempura aux Crevettes. Actually, they have 5 different Yakitoris and Tempura selections. 

But if you feel like mixing your Japanese with Chinese, try the Poisson Szechuannais ou L'agneau Mongolien. Thinking about noodles? They have Pad Thai au Poulet ou Boeuf, ou Udon.  They even have on Vendredis et Samedis la Cuisine Chaude, ""Boulettes de Pieuvre"" ou Takoyaki! And being in Quebec, they offer Escargots Gratines. Oh, and if you want a little flavor of Korea, order the Kimchi! No Poutine, though!

The service was actually pretty friendly and efficient, and the food wasn't bad for an AYCE place. Dinner is $25.50, and you fill out your 2 tickets, and when you are ready, fill 2 more out till you're full. 

If you feel like Asian food but want a variety and you are really hungry, this place is meant for you. Bon Appetit!",0

trn_4852,"I am a 8 year cancer patient and received world class treatment and customer service from University Cancer Center in Tucson. I live in Mesa AZ, The University was taken over by Banner, so I thought I would save mileage on my car and check out the Lymphoma Specialist at Banner MD Anderson  Gilbert AZ. The phone customer service was great, sounded very caring.. When they made my appointment I made a point to ask how I would find the doctor, and building. I was told its easy to find ! .. Well it was not. I finally went to the Banner Hospital front desk and was advised the Cancer Center was around the back behind the hospital and that this happens all the time. If I had not asked where they were located and not had a cast on my leg I might not have been upset. I drove over to the correct building, told the receptionist I was a new patient. She pointed and said its that way .. well I went to the wrong desk, retraced my steps to the correct check in .. so far I was not impressed, but the doctors bio kept me there. I met with an intake person, who then called a volunteer to take me up to the Dr.'s Office.
I checked in there, after a short wait I was called back, the room was down some long winding hallways.. I was placed in a cold sterile looking room. I sat there for 30 plus minutes called my husband and said I was not too happy.. I finally stepped out of the room, there was no one in sight !! I waited outside the room another 10 minutes after 40 minutes of being ignored the Dr. arrived. He apologized after I mentioned my long wait and no one to question or let me know he was behind schedule, I felt like I was being ignored.  I had a nice talk with the Dr and explained I was searching for a new oncologist, and I liked his credentials. I was impressed, and decided to make the change.. 

Now 10 days later I get a statement from my Insurance Co. They are refusing to pay the bill for my visit because the MD Anderson Cancer Center did not include a diagnosis ( reason for treatment ) or BILLED INCORRECTLY.  I called my insurance company, and they confirmed this is what happened and the Cancer Center needs to resubmit correctly.

I tried unsuccessfully to talk to someone at MD Anderson Banner.. to no avail I get answering machines, get disconnected, nothing ! I can only talk to G. the girl assigned to my alphabetic letter of my last name, her recorded message says she will return my call in 2 business days!! I tried to talk to customer care, again with the machine ..  Seriously ? University Medical Center in Tucson was 5 star, so far I rate the Banner MD Anderson 2 stars, only because the girls who answer the phone are pleasant and the Dr. seemed great. 

To tell you the truth I think I am thinking of sticking with Tucson .. 
I expected more from MD Anderson Name. I have been spoiled by world class treatment at UMC.",-1
trn_4853,"I have been going to Dental Care West, the west side clinic offered by A.T. Still University since April 2015. They came highly recommended.  

I have had my scheduled appointments change 3 times without my approval. I find out about the change when I show up for my originally schedule appointment. This is very bad customer service.

Otherwise, most of the residents are OK dentists. You have to have a new dentist every July, so I am up to my third 'regular"" dentist. To get my appointments when I needed them, I changed the resident & dentist. I found out that many of the residents and their coaching dentists don't read the files to know what is going on with my treatment before I come in. This bad practice. I also had a problem when the dentist did work he thought I needed without discussing it with me first but not owning up to it after I got angry. Frustrating.

I have to go back hopefully only 1 more time to fix the problem they created. Problem: I had root canals and crowns done and then they did the implant extraction. During the healing time, my prior crowned teeth shifted resulting in a large gap between my teeth and pain.  They do realize that this is a problem they caused and are not charging me but they keep putting off doing the work. So now I'm re-scheduled with a different resident/dentist so I can get my work done.

The support staff that help the dentists are the best. Front office -not so much. It's been a long drawn out process.  I just want my teeth fixed. It shouldn't be this difficult.",-1

The most important flaw is that this gym is very stingy with its air conditioning.  Here it is nearly June and I swear they still don't have it on for us.  This gym is like an oven, even in the morning and evening hours.  I like a gym with constant air flowing through it so that I can be as comfortable as possible, even though I'm working out.

The second flaw is that this gym gets pretty crowded during peak times.  I have to go at unusual times just to get the machines I want.  I hate that.

trn_4873,"I'm surprised by all the Asian joints that have popped up since I've been in Madison 3+ years ago. Taiwan Little Eats is an adorable cafe to grab a quick bite, some boba, and hang out with some buddies. There's wifi, natural light, and soft Chinese music in the background, which makes for a good place to get some work or self-reflection done.
I had the tainan bowl, which consists of pork belly, tea egg, and some veggies over a bowl of rice. The pork belly was flavorful and very tender. Even though it's Taiwanese fusion, the flavors are still authentic (yay!)
If you're getting the milk tea, I'd recommend 50%. I got 30% and it boardered on the not sweet enough side for me.",1

I've had some different sandwiches, meals, desserts, and also bought some of their sausage for the grill. They have always impressed. 

We walk by this place sometimes and the smell makes you want to go in there and grab something. 

It's very close to Old Town if you are visiting, and if you're local, you've got a gem in your back yard.",1

The Reuben was OK in size, was a little dry but they gave me more dressing. The sauerkraut is not your typical sauerkraut and gave the sandwich a different taste. Bought my son a kids meal and the boxed chocolate milk was spoiled/thick. They replaced it with a fountain drink. The location is nice and clean. Very open feeling, went in the early afternoon and it was nice and quiet. The staff was nice.",0

I got three rolls and probably 4 ounces of sake - for a grand total of about $60 with tip.

I'm not using to spending that way, but this is the kind of place where I feel the most comfortable doing it. The food is decadent, the service is impeccable, and the decor is sophisticated but unique.

trn_4878,"My boyfriend and I LOVE Ren Faires and decided to make the trip to Las Vegas for this faire.  We were not disappointed.  In fact, this faire was much larger than the Pleasure Faire in Irwindale, CA to our surprise.  There were a lot of vendors, lots of guilds set up for wandering through.  I did notice the ""players"" didn't engage us the way they do at the Pleasure Faire, which was a bummer.  Also, Sunset Park doesn't have nearly enough parking and parking attendants weren't very helpful in directing us when all the lots were full.  There weren't good directional signs to the entrance either, but we managed to find it after our hike from the off site parking place we found.  It was a beautiful day, although quite warm.  We'll go again, and maybe plan to stay into the evening, but will need to figure out the parking situation if we do.  I can't imagine where late comers ended up parking.

It was a lot of fun, and too bad it's only for 1 weekend.",1

Now I'm not usually the kind of person who likes to wait in a line but I thought ok I have some down time. 

I arrive at this place and sure enough there was a line. But here is the thing about the line. Every 10 min or so someone comes out to check on the people standing there. To let them know what items have either sold out or about to. There is water and even sunscreen provided!  It's pretty awesome customer service. The dad of the owner even came by to tell me all about their food and what would be good for a first timer like me. 

I pretty much got a little of everything. And yes!!!!! It was fabulous! The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and sausage seriously mouth watering! 

But really what makes it take a little piece of my heart is their genuine customer service. I love how everyone there seemed to care about the customers and looked after each and every them.  

If you like some fantastic BBQ go here. If you want to go to a place that treats its customers right definitely go here but why not get the best of both by coming here! 

I can't wait to come back for more!!!!",1
trn_4886,"This Starbucks drives me nuts.

First, the staff is completely incompetent.  This has been a growing theme amongst Starbucks', but they do some things that really irritate me.

The staff touch their eyes, lips, face, hair and never wash their hands.  Today the girl behind the counter was picking gunk off her eyelash - didn't wash her hands.  They've had two staff members with visible lip cold sores (i.e. herpes) serving ... just, like, the peeps a day off.  

The staff has major attitude as well.  I have a really weird drink order. I get it. I announce that it's weird before I launch into it.  But it's also a $6 drink.  So, for $6, I think I can ask for my drink in an odd way.  It's nothing they can't do.  But today the dude literally rolled his eyes, laughed at me, and went over to discuss it with his co-worker. WTF. What the acutal eff.

Anyway, it's the closest Starbucks to my work so when it's -20, I have little to no choice if I want something from a Sbux.  But I hate it nonetheless.  Actually now I'm just realizing maybe it only serves people in the Hilton (i.e. tourists) because most other offices have a closer Starbucks, so they don't care how they treat people because they don't think they get a lot of repeat business.  Hmm.",-1

as they said, the place is gorgeous! both the inside and their patio! really enjoyed sitting on the patio with the green view (rare in the financial district) and great music. 
however, the food didn't live up to its beautiful ambiance. their unsweetened iced tea was good, but nothing great. their pistachio loaf was not too bad, i liked the pistachio bits in it but i wouldn't get it again as it was way too greasy, sweet, and heavy for my taste. i couldn't finish it cuz it was just too heavy... and it was 3:30 pm and I hadn't had anything all day before that! i was super hungry and could have eaten so much more! the croissant was too oily as well. 
i felt pretty gross after. to be honest, i was a little bit disappointed; seemed like they focused so hard on the presentation that they neglected the most important part - the food. i dunno, maybe i just got the wrong stuff. regardless, if it wasn't for the decor, i would have given it 2 stars.",0

Had the pulled pork and rock shrimp street tacos for our main meal. Great tasting. Large portions. And to top it off, the fries that cd with the pulled pork are mixed! So you get waffle fries, steak fries, and skinny fries all together! Bonus!

So, if you want cole slaw, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, a salad, etc., with your burger, better look elsewhere. I tried the double bacon burger, $6.79, wasn't that big, decent tasting enough though. Cajun fries were just OK, nothing special. One plus is that you really can have it ""your way...""

When it was just a few things for $2 they were good deals, but now it's starting to take away shelf space from the $1 products. But I'm sure that's a corporate decision.

The crowd is happy, the music is upbeat, and there's actually places to sit other than the daybeds/cabanas. Guestlist is seriously easy to get on (we were already set but there are people inside Encore handing out business cards for guestlist as well). Fridays are my favorite day to go since they do the giveaways and have been supplying most of my summer swimsuits (and I mean designer ones that typically cost $150). Security is pretty nice, the staff are helpful, and I've actually seen the lifeguards doing their job instead of standing around talking and not looking at the pool.

trn_4916,"Right off the bat, this place garnered my respect as one the first restaurants (Chinese or otherwise) I've been to without any noticeable spelling errors on the menu! No need to roll the culinary dice, as I once did with the crap [sic] salad at a sushi bar.

And what a menu it is. At western Chinese restaurants, there are 100+ variations on combining the same dozen everyday ingredients. Here it looks like there is a genuine wide array of traditional dishes available, including several I haven't seen before. I'd have to come several times to form a truly informed opinion.

A group of 7 of us went one late morning, since there is always strength in numbers when partaking in dim sum. We got items running the whole gamut of dim sum options, and overall I was happy with the quality. Not head and shoulders above the usual suspects, but a bit (hence 4 stars). The tripe, which I usually abhor, actually had an acceptable texture, and was heavily gingered in a good way. The only miss was an odd flank cut, consisting mostly of cartilaginous nubs that no one at our table enjoyed. 

Not as many sauces were automatically serve as at other popular downtown spots, but you can ask for them and the service was prompt. No trolleys here, ordering is à la carte. After ordering, a receipt is printed and put on the table. This lets you see how much is left to come, because they strike items off it as they are served. There is some free parking in the back, just try not to get blocked in like we did. I'll probably be back, as the authentic dinner menu definitely warrants exploration.",1

trn_4919,"Came in today for Sunday dinner. Greeted and seated immediately at the table with the  couch by the restrooms(one of my pet peeves ). 
I feel like we didn't get enough attention compare to the other tables our server had. I did come in work out clothes, socks and slippers. But that shouldn't explain the poor service. 

Ok let's talk about it-
got seated and they dropped off 2 water glasses with no ice and a vase of water. I guess they don't like their water cold here. So I asked if we can have ice with our water and he comes back with 1 glass of ice, so my girl and I shared this one glass of ice water our whole dinner. So dinner..

We ordered:
-New England fry
-kurobota pork chops 
-scallops
-asparagus
-Mac n cheese
-kids chicken & fries 
-garden mule (cocktail)
-Brookie (dessert)
-Dutch chocolate ice cream

let's start with the New England fry. It was basically fried calamari and whole bellied clams. It was good but nothing spectacular. The batter didn't adhere to the seafood well.

We ordered a garden mule to share since we just went bar hopping last night..one drink won't hurt right? We weren't very fond of it. she chugged it so she wouldn't taste it lol. 

Entrees: 
Lady ordered scallops with cauliflower purée and greens. We both liked this dish. Seasoned well and plated beautifully. I had the kurobota pork chops which were pretty bland and it didn't help that it was dry either. I had to ask for more sauce but even that took forever because our server was never around. the only good thing on that plate was the slaw but that's not the reason I paid $27. I was unhappy with my entree and match it with neglected service, it was pretty much downhill. 
We also had Mac n cheese and asparagus as side items and both were pretty tasty. 

Dessert:
'Brookie' brownie and cookie combo topped off with salted caramel chunk ice cream. Sounds good enough right? while, the idea is good...the execution could've been better. the brook was a lil hard. I was expecting moist and soft. That salted caramel ice cream is to die for! Best thing I had tonight other than our one & only glass of ice water. 

Our dinner wasn't crazy expensive but at that price point..I'd expect more attentive service and staff actually coming around more often checking on us, filling our water. Instead of dropping off a pitcher & food and not see a server til check time.

trn_4922,"If I could give this review less than 1 star I would. That is how disappointing our stay was. We have been owners for a few years now. We have stayed at this location a few times and had never been so dissatisfied. We booked a  2 bedroom condo for 2 nights. When we walked in, the smell was horrible, the floor was sticky and dirty, the dining table had crumbs and was full of chocolate. We had furniture that doesn't even match, the shower in the master bedroom had mold on the drain. Our view was blocked with trees. I called the front desk and spoke to the night manager, I explained to him how unhappy I was with our place, from the cigarette smell to how dirty it was. I told him I could not believe the type of room they had given us, as it had not been fully cleaned, the cigarette smell was very bad, the furniture not matching, the kitchen being so outdated, the mold in their shower and on top of that our view was blocked. I also asked him if they had given us their worst room as we had never stayed in this type of room before. His response was, we will get someone to clean the room for you, and this is our new style of rooms as we have been remodeled. Really, this place has been remodeled???? ( I will post pictures of their supposedly newly remodeled condos) He also said he could not move us to a different room as it was sold out. So that would mean we were stuck with this room for our 2night stay. Having our 3 year old breathing this cigarette smell, was unacceptable. 

Now keep in mind, I called the front desk the moment we walked into our condo. In the 2 nights we were there no one showed up to clean, like the manager said. After, waiting for them close to midnight, I cleaned the place. I did their job that was supposed to be done before we arrived. 
Then we meet some people at the elevator and asked us if we were owners or guest. We told them we were owners but were extremely unhappy with this weekend stay. We told them everything about our place,  well guess what?? They were also staying in a 2 bedroom condo and their place was modern and nice, nothing compared to ours. What does this mean??? That they give their guest the best condos they have so they could become owners and give the owners their outdated, dirty rooms! 
Unbelievable Worldmark!! The reason we are owners is to stay in better places than a hotel room but obviously this weekend was not the case!",-1
trn_4923,"Lunch there today. I read the Yelp reviews before I went. Many of the same things other diners had mentioned were still issues. I got a salad.

I wouldn't have thought too much about it, but a man came to sit over near us as we were finishing and had a salad too. His lunch completely filled the bowl and was even rounded on top. That is about the size you normally see for a luncheon sized main dish serving.

You normally get an amazing quality.... but the truth is that my expensive swimwear is changing his color from black to r-e-d.
Not a big deal, just disappointed.
I went to Beach Bunny store at the fashion show mall 
I told one of the employees about my swimwear that I wear only twice.
She told me,
No recite  ? No refund.
I was really tried to explain myself.
I didn't want even refund!!! And I never thought that I suppose to even use this recite !!! I just want the same swimwear again but without to change his color!!
She let me feel uncomfortable in her stor e.
And I asked to talk with the manager.
The manager came. Both of them was looking at me and trying to tell me that this swimwear is fake ! And anyway she don't have it anymore.
I was almost crying in this store.
I saw they have my swimwear and after been there almost an hour she decided to give me a new one ( so she DO have it.....).

It was a few months ago.
And yesterday I was wearing the new swimwear again and guess what?
It's become RED !!!!!!!!
I will N E V E R recommend about you guys.
And I'll never go to fight with your russian manager again!!!!!!

The gravy was delicious. Very good over all. The hash brown pieces were cut thick and it was only a little bit crispy. I don't really like potato soft so this wasn't a hit for me.

We purchased my wedding band from from James in late March, and they delivered it in plenty of time. It seemed to fit well, which was good, since my ring is made of an alloy that can't be resized. Unfortunately, a month after my wedding, the ring fell off my finger and was lost at work. When I came to James and Troy, and explained that I had been sized wrong and the ring slipped off, they contacted the manufacturer and had the correct size back in a week. I had expected to pay for my replacement, but hoped we could work a deal since I had been sized incorrectly at first. To my surprise, they replaced my wedding band at their own expense.

I unfortunately have a fleet car requiring me to use NTB for oil changes, state inspections and minor repairs.  This is the only convenient location.  
During my visits, I have interacted with at least 7 staff members and not one was pleasant.  
They do not like working with the fleet company because it ""takes too long and they want too much information"". 
One even suggested I use another location!!
During my last 3 visits, they have had angry customers yelling and using bad language. One even had young children.   All seemed to be angry about work not being completed when promised.  

I should have taken the employee up on their suggestion to go to another location.  If I come back here, I can't complain because I know what kind of atmosphere I will find and it isn't pleasant but it is borderline scary as this area has deteriorated rapidly over the past few years.",-1

trn_4953,"One of those places you read great reviews about, go there, then get super disappointed!

Greeted up front and seated immediately in the back by the restrooms (Strike 1)..
Not sure if it was because we didn't look rich enough to be seated with the rest of the crowd.. Lol

(Strike 2, 3, 4) Our server was Casey... He deserved maybe 1 star to be nice... NO WHERE TO BE SEEN or get a hold of especially when were all the way in the back. Came to ""check up"" on us about 3 - 4 times for a total of 1 min each time. Saw him mingling and chit chatting with the other tables but no attention to us of course. I give him 1 star for knowledge of the menu and food.

We ordered -
New England Fry : fried calamari with fried clams, huge calamari (I prefer my pieces to be smaller), and fiancé pointed out that batter didn't adhere to well. No big deal but we've had better.
Garden Mule (cocktail) : strong, ginger drink, not a fan.
Sea Scallops : REALLY GOOD dish, scallops perfectly cooked, drizzled with truffle oil (my favorite!), served on a bed of cauliflower purée!
(Strike 5) Pork Chops : dry, bland, not worth $27!
For sides we had Grilled Asparagus and Mac N Cheese - with kale, not too cheesy, and went well with my scallops!
Kids Chicken Breast with side of Fries and Sundae ($19)- good but over priced to be considered a ""kid's meal"".
Desserts were a Brookie - brownie meets cookie topped with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream ; Brookie could have been more moist and warm, but the ice cream was delicious!

Service, seating, dry pork chop and prices killed the 30 min drive and experience to Honey Salt.

The food was decent. We were fond of the Salmon dish, and Shrimp cocktail. The salad bar was ok. The veggies, especially the leafy greens, looked a bit wilted at the time we dined (round 1130am). Sushi area could use a bit more authentication *hahaha* California Roll ... is that really sushi? ^_~

Just like Jon G. stated... ""$10 all you can drink after buying the buffet."" However, there is a time limit on how long you can enjoy your cold one.

The customer service was always friendly and professional. After saks moved to town square and premium north it has gone to complete crap. Quality has gone way downhill, everything has scuffs and marks all over it.  They don't do their 30%-40% off anymore. I walked in the store this morning and not one person greeted me. Walked into the fitting room area with 12 items, no one was their to greet me. Continued to shop for over an hour, I watched 2 employees loudly and inappropriately laugh and talk while pretending to clean the sales floor. I looked right at them, locked eyes with them and they did not say a word to me. I went to check out, no one was at the register. I stood waiting for someone while the 2 employees I mentioned earlier continued on with their conversation. Eventually 1 of them came over and said ""i will ring you up"".

I was really excited to try the UFO Fried Rice, seeing as everyone on Yelp was recommending it. The portion was big, however, I was a bit disappointed in its taste. It didn't have much flavour to it other than an egg and cheese taste - nothing special. My boyfriend's mom got the bibimbop. At first we were shocked at how big the stone bowl was when they carried it out, but when they set it down, the portion was actually very little. She's a small Asian lady, and even that wasn't enough to fill her!

All our meals came with refillable side dishes and soup. The side dishes were good, but the soup had such an odd taste. None of us liked it.

I'm all about  the appetizers, so was delighted when they served my two favourite ones after we ordered: glass noodle and potato. The glass noodles isn't too oily, and the potato is cooked soft with a sweet glaze. The fact that it was unlimited was a bonus!

""Gal Combi"" ($37.99) -20 peice sashimi,12 peice sushi (uni, hamachi, tuna unagi, salmon, scallopi) and 6 peice dynamite maki :
20 pieces may not sound like a lot, but this was enough to fill two people sufficiently. If you like raw fish, you can't go wrong ordering sashimi at Gal's. The fish is SOOO fresh, and nicely sized. Whenever I come here I always end up ordering some sort of sushi set because they usually offer a nice mixture of rolls, sashimi and sushi, with a wide variety of fish. The rice ratio and composition of the sushi is also just the way I like it, with minimal rice, and more fish!

At the end of the meal they serve you some complimentary peices of fruit, and this red bean jelly dessert. I was stuffed at this point, so it was nice to end off on some lighter post-meal desserts. Another satisfying meal at Gal's!",1

We all got their $7.99 lunch combo which lets you choose from an app, main, and curry. I tried their pakora chicken, briyani rice, and butter chicken.

We were pretty sure this entire establishment was only staffed by 1 person (and maybe the waiter doubles as the chef) because it took over half hour for us to get our food. 

Long wait aside, the food tasted pretty good! Although the butter chicken was pretty spicy, everything was pretty flavourful. I'd definitely recommend ordering take out next time.",0
trn_4969,"This place gets amazing reviews. We were excited to try it. Extremely disappointed. Don't waste your time or your money. Over $300 for 2 people without a bottle of wine (just a glass and 1 cocktail) and without dessert. 

Bar service- When we got there, the table wasn't ready (we had reservations). They told us we would wait at the bar if we wanted. We walked over to the bar, which wasn't packed but people were seated there. The bartenders never acknowledged us, never looked up, despite our numerous attempts to get their attention, get a drink. etc. We were there 20 minutes, never got anyones attention before we finally were taken to our table. 

Sommelier- I wanted a glass of wine, but am only familiar with california wines. Here, they have mostly greek wines. The waiter suggested a wine based on my description and offered a taste and also then sent the sommelier over. I tasted it and told the sommelier that it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I tried to describe what I might be looking for. He said that what he had was too this or too that. I asked if maybe they had a bottle of something we could order since he didn't think there was anything they sold by the glass he thought I would like. He stood silent, then stood there staring at me, then off in the distance for literally 2-3 minutes waiting for, I don't know what. I blindly stared at the menu, then him, not sure what he was expecting me to do. At a loss and very uncomfortable at this point, I ended up caving and ordering a glass of the wine I had already told him I really didn't like just to get him to leave. What a mistake, but when someone tells you he has nothing he thinks you'll like then doesn't leave, what do you do?

Food- the appetizer was average to even below average, the fried zucchini was cold and soggy. The main, grilled fish, was fresh and seasoned well, but the waiter advised us where the bones would be, collar, shoulder. Wrong, there were bones everywhere. Not so appetizing digging bones out of every bite. 

Go somewhere else.",-1

The chocolate PB shake was not blended well and had a huge blob of chocolate at the bottom. The grilled turkey sandwich was very good. If I did go back I would skip the shakes, not worth the wait.",-1

Insurance had my daughter's DOB off by 1 day (which was the insurance companies fault) and they refused to take our insurance and required payment upfront, which unfortunately we did not have. I even offered to get the insurance company on the phone to verify eligibility and they refused. The woman upfront was rude and condescending stating, I quote, ""if it were my kid, I would find the money so obviously you don't seem to care that much."" NEVER again will our family be coming here. Went to another pediatric urgent care 2 miles away and they were extremely helpful and understanding. Advised that they see many patients leave there and go to their facility stating how rude that Good Night Pediatrics is. My advice to them is to overhaul their staff. You need people who care in there. With already having a rating below  2 stars, this place has been on the downhill for a while.",-1

Food: **** 1/2

These were the juiciest, tastiest wings I've ever had.

But the service sucked. They seemed to be over staffed and also the MoD was rare to appear (and all the wait staff snapped to attention when he did show his face).

Coupled with the loud music and obnoxious birthday procedure, the eat-in experience left much to be desired.

We might come back... But probably for takeout.",0

The guide was extremely well versed on the subject matter and gave lots of information. If you are a baseball fan and particular a fan of Clemente this is the place for you. As a person with less background in baseball, I was a little bit overwhelmed. I would highly recommend this for the real fan. The review on this site by Amanda J. gives misleading information.

I did not read too many reviews because I did not want to be influenced. The one review I did read mentioned the rude kitchen lead and I am guessing that was the same person I said under my breath was a terrible person.  I don't know but almost thinking he maybe the owner?

Seems to me when they remodeled they should have made the kitchen bigger and more feng shui. I also feel like there is a lot of wasted space. They were not busy when I went on Sunday at 9:30am but if they are as busy as it sounds there could be so much more seating. I was watching the kitchen staff and perhaps they need training and a sense of ""team"" to be more effective. Especially since they are visible to the public.  Overall vibe was not rewarding. Did not feel any different from when I walked in. 

The food, eh not impressed. I ate it (3 stars) but pretty sure will never have a craving. Maybe they should visit La Creperie in Fort Collins, CO. That I enjoyed. 

And no substitutions, you may delete but not add.

They have online scheduling which is a breeze to use, and the staff was friendly. My nail tech, Anthony stated the current gel I had on was too thick and it shouldn't be that way. I told him that I prefer it thicker, as I use hand sanitizer all day long at work and my nails are brittle. 

After my nails were done, I had a feeling they wouldn't last, because the gel was just too thin! Well, two days later, a nail cracked, chipped and by one week, I had several nails chipped. Hmmmph.  

I also had the spa pedi. I did really enjoy the pedi, as they are very sanitary. They wrap their bowl in a plastic bag so your not swimming in everyone else's germs! They use fresh cut fruits to infuse the water and a lavender oil. They also rub your legs down with hot stones! 

For both services, I only paid a whopping $55! That is a bonus. I just wish my nails lasted longer.

As I come in, a very nice lady seats me and hands me a menu. I automatically notice how large the menu is, and how clean the place is. Lots of large round tables, single tables, and lots of space in general. The spring rolls were a rather smaller appetizer than I imagined, considering it is $5 for a roll! Ouch. The beef pho was pretty decent sized and had lots lean meat (no hanging goops of fat anywhere), $8. The chopsticks are made of out metal and for some reason every time it accidently hit my teeth while I took a bite, it made me cringe.. I noticed that there was no available condiments on every table like most pho places, they bring them out in ramekins.. which leads me to think they are trying to stay 'high class' vietnamese/american- but is a bit disappointing since the groups of sriracha and oyster sauce on a table is a signature pho icon. Atleast. For me.

trn_5027,"NYNY's food court is modelled after Greenwich Village and is a breath of fresh air on the strip after experiencing the over-the-top excesses found in The Venetian, Caesar's Palace and Bellagio. Right in the middle of the ""Village Eateries"" you can find Greenberg's Deli. We walked in and encountered no line on a Friday afternoon in February. The help behind the counter was friendly and helpful and the sandwiches didn't take very long to prepare.

I couldn't resist the temptation to sample their foot long hot dog ($3.95) which came with potato salad. I also ordered a cup of Matzah ball soup ($3.50). My lovely wife opted for the Reuben sandwich (a whopping $9.50). A bottle of water ($2.50) and two draft Peronis ($5.25 apiece) rounded out the order. We sat ""outside"" on the sidewalk and dug in. The Reuben was monstrous with corned beef and sauerkraut spilling out beyond the edges of the insufficiently large slices of rye. I glanced down at the 12"" of wiener and large warm balls on my plate and was momentarily jealous of this impressive package.

Ref: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=lqw28h3QHm0LbOMuhv7lMw

I idly wondered how their ""Italian Stallion"" sandwich measured up. The jealousy didn't last for long. The Matzah ball soup lacked the ""schmaltzy"" flavor I was expecting and the dog was merely a very long but otherwise average dog. The Reuben was a bit better and possessed the girth the dog lacked. I did like their potato salad. The Peroni (served in an under-sized plastic cup) was cold and crisp and altogether unremarkable.

Without considering the price tag, this was quite a pleasant (although completely forgettable) three-star experience. However, the bill came to $32.27 and with it came raised expectations. The NYNY website states that the average check comes to $8-9 per person. Obviously, this is a figure that doesn't include alcohol. Give me a break!

trn_5029,"We will definitely be eating here again! This review is for a take out order placed over the phone. 
Have to admit that when we began looking at the take out containers... we were a bit underwhelmed. They didn't look like very big portions. This was our first time trying this restaurant and the concern was that we were not getting our money's worth. Also one of our containers was only a little over half way full. We called the restaurant back to tell them about our concerns and the owner could not have been more gracious in hearing us out. He made sure that we received everything in our order, explained that each container was 16 oz., and then immediately offered to replace the container of chicken tika masala that was only a little over half way full. The owner delivered our chicken tika masala himself! And even brought an extra order of naan. 
As it turns out that the containers were actually really misleading. They appeared to be very small, but in reality contained a decent sized portion.  And truth is... the food is delicious!!! Worth every penny!  
So to the owner of this restaurant (I'm so sorry that I didn't catch your name) Thanks so much for going the extra mile to make your customers happy! 
I know I've been mostly talking about the customer service received, but the quality of the food here is also excellent! Everything was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for some good cuisine!",1

But you better pray to god that when you're waiting in line, you never have to use the restroom because you'll have to talk to 20 people to get back in line. You'll also probably need written approval to be in a line because it's extremely possible that you can wait 2 hours before being told you have to go in the back of the line because some employee told a group of girls they can cut everybody when they can't. I get that security has to put up with so much BS, but when everyone's treated like a scumbag in line and they try to charge you double at the entrance than advertised, it's easy to get upset.

trn_5034,"OVERVIEW: I've been here 5 times with my friends from opening night through just 2 weeks ago and we all have yet to have a good time here.  Phoenix is in desperate need for a great gay dance bar.  Year after year Charlie's, a gay country western bar, wins ""Best Dance Bar"".  Unfortunately, Club Forbidden is apparently not up to the challenge - blown speakers, inconsistent drinks, poor parking, & a typically bitchy crowd makes this IKEA/Trading Spaces remake of a classic scottsdale dive bar, not worth the effort.

MUSIC: Blown speakers when you first walk in the main entrance is the perfect indication of what you're in for: the music is always too loud.  What's worse is there is no place to get away from it and socialize with your friends unless you can handle choking on thick cigarette smoke on the small, noisy, overly crowded, parking lot patio.
As mentioned in other reviews, the main room's DJ plays an iPod Shuffle style mixture of Top 40s music from the past 25 years with no logical flow.  The music in the smaller electronica room is much better and is more likely to instill that ""OMG, I this mix is awesome, I want it!"" emotion we have all experienced going to a great nightclub.  Unfortunately, like the main room, the music is too loud to enjoy here as well and ears are ringing after just a few moments.

DRINKS: Drinks range from weak to mediocre.  Typically my drinks were barely 1 shot for an Absolut and Redbull served in a large glass.  I felt waterlogged before I could feel the slightest buzz.

BOTTOM LINE: My friends and I REALLY want to like this bar (that's why we've gone back 4 more times) but it just can't compare to how good the late Boom and the late Crowbar (now DWNTWN) were.",-1

trn_5038,"A great product but poor execution sometimes.

I ordered from here more than a few times because, when done right, these cookies are bomb. And unique (and delivered to your door at 2am).

But sometimes they are inconsistent. Sometimes the cookies are warm, sometimes they're room temp/cold. And if they aren't warm, they aren't very good. They also change the frostings on the cereal themed ones-- sometimes it's one frosting, the next day it's a clear goo like frosting. I like one, but I don't like the other. But I never know what I'm going to get. Today, my cookies were extremely ugly looking. While usually aesthetically pleasing, it looks like someone haphazardly poured Frosted Flakes over very lightly frosted, deformed, room temperature cookies. This particular order came through Postmates so MAYBE postmates took a long time to deliver, hence the cookies being cold and stale. But it doesn't explain the haphazard nature by which they were prepared. 

Update: Since posting this review, the business reached out and apologized. They offered to re-deliver my order for free and even threw in some ice cream without me asking. It was a quick, delicious order. They didn't even ask me to edit my review or anything. Considering the awesome customer service and willingness to go above and beyond without me even asking, I think a 5 star rating (from my original 2 star) is warranted.

My tongue was tingly all over. It wasn't unbearable, but it was strong, and the description of the oil said it would be good for asian style dishes, so someone gifted the chilli oil to me ;-) Since I was traveling, the staff person was able to seal the bottle with wax, so on the plane, the changes in pressure wouldn't make the bottle leak or pop, and she was nice enough to give me bubble wrap.

My wife asked for more and they said no. I have been to the restaurant a few times and we have this discussion every time. I ask for as many of the green Chile sauce served in those tiny containers and each time they bring out 1 or 2.  When I complain and ask for more they tell me no.   I'm always told no because they say they didn't make enough. There is a great Peruvian place called mamitas in Glendale California I use to go to all the time and they served that stuff in a squeeze botttle. I would drench it in that stuff.  I love love love that sauce so when these people are so damn chinsy it pisses me off.  At first it was a laughing matter, kind of a joke but I'm eating my meal now and I wish I had more. You guys need to make a ton of that green Chile and never tell your customers they can't have anymore.  Stop limiting my green Chile.  It's ridiculous.   You would get he 5 stars if you gave me more Chile like I requested. I'm not used to being told no over condiments so this whole situation is kray. Make more Chile and keep your customers happy. My wife is scrapping the lid right now and this little container we isn't even filled half way!!!!!",0
trn_5045,"Great local theater that is not inside a casino, which means you don't have to potentially park 1/4 mile away then zigzag your way through the casino maze just to watch a movie.  This Regal theater shows both main stream and indie films, which is another plus in my book. It is never really crowded on the occasions that I have been there, and the line to purchase movie tickets are rarely long.  Plus, you can buy or print your movie ticket inside at a self-serve kiosk, just in front of the ticket collector.

There are also many restaurants in the immeidate vacinity of the theater. Most notably Archi's Thai Restaurant and Bachi Burger (Summerlin branch), which flank the theater.  Round Table Pizza is also just a short walk away, plus a bunch of others that are in the same strip mall.

What else can I say, except that it is a neighborhood theater in one of the good parts of town serving local moviegoers.  It is not new or large, but is always kept clean and charges market rate for tickets and food.

Parking: 5/5  You may not always get the spaces in the row that is closest to the theater, but your parking space will definitely be closer compared to a casino theather or Rave.

Price:  3/5  Market rate.  Not a plus or a minus.  It is what it is.

Cleanliness:  4/5  Great, considering the age of the theater.  Plus patrons tend to be more mature (not just age) and respectful, so not a lot of mess for the staff to clean up after each movie.

Line/Wait:  4.5/5  Rarely any line to wait in for buying tickets, and if you do have people ahead of you, the line moves pretty quickly.

4.5 stars in my opinion",1
trn_5046,"This is a great diversion from the strip, well worth searching out if you like pinball. Machines of all vintages, all lovingly maintained and playable, for a reasonable price. A nice touch is the handwritten cards on the machines giving a bit of history. You can play the first machine to have electronic scoring, or the first to feature long hair and short skirts.

-Name was NOT on the Fast Break board, as a result no car ready.
-Had to wait to speak to Fast Break counter person, he was nice but did not have a car to give and could not find my contract!
-Finally told contract must be in the car, went to car, NOTHING THERE!
-Spoke to an assistant manager who agreed to help (after the second ask).  She realized I was not getting anywhere.
-She had me sit in car and drive up to booth to wait, after 25 MINS! I finally got to leave and was told manager would call me and ""take care of the rental"" due to the ""unacceptable"" circumstances.
-Upon checking car back in I was told that I had to go to the counter because they COULDN'T CHECK ME IN?! (WHAT??!!).  I took one look at the Fast Break line that was 10 people deep and went upstairs, that main line was out of the Budget area - I left, not wasting more time on this establishment that clearly does not care about me.
-NO phone call from manager, NO discount on the rental.
-On line with customer service as i write this, they had the nerve to offer me COUPONS!  Haha! no thanks, they will not be getting my business again. 
-Ultimately the customer service person gave me a 25% discount on the rental and some coupons (that I won't use). She was nice enough, but wow, bad spot for her to have to deal with.",-1
trn_5056,I have been to this place twice so far. It has a very cool concept you get to watch them make the ice cream right in front of you. The first time I went I ordered the salted pretzel and the most recent time I went I got a red velvet ice cream. They were both good not the best ice cream I've had but I think it's more the experience it's a different and fun thing. For my preference the ice cream taste more like cream then the flavor you choose. It's not as flavorful as I like. They also only put a tiny dollop of whipped cream if you ask for it.I would come back here it is a fun place to go.,0
trn_5057,"Melt is a sweet tiny shop with the most unusual variations of ice cream. Something for every taste. The service is adequate.

He ended up doing what I asked, but the questions he posed as he was cutting were a bit insulting.  I'm sure he didn't mean it that way, but I didn't appreciate being asked if I fixed my hair on a daily basis.  I asked for a short easy style that could be jazzed up on occasion.

trn_5064,"We had first gone to the XS nightclub, since it had a 4 star review. We waited in line for 2 hours and once we went inside it was super crowded, you couldn't even walk or breath passing people. We left within the first 10 minutes that we were there. So then we looked online and found La Jolla. We gave it a try, outside it doesn't look appealing, once you walk inside you see somewhat of a small space, compare to XS nightclub. The bar is on the right side and the dance floor in the middle.

Once we first walked in, we ordered drinks, one shot, one beer, one soda was $28, somewhat pricy. Then we found seats right next to the dance floor, we waited couple minutes to see how the music was, and we actually liked it. Couple minutes later we started dancing, the DJ played good music, a lot of merengue, reguetton, bachata. He also played punta, which to me this is totally new, since no club that I have ever been to has ever played punta, and I really enjoyed it. He also played English music, slow jams, and Mexican music like Banda, corridos, but not so much. So If you're into straight Mexican music like Banda and corridos, you will not hear the DJ play this music much. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the night, we didn't leave the club until 5AM, I love clubbing, and I had never dance this much in a club before but the music was good so we danced all night and had a blast",1

I thought I should go with the house specialty and went with a ""Brizza"" - I ordered the Chicago, which has rosemary potatoes, sausage and cheese, but I substituted the regular sausage for turkey sausage.  Yummy.  The only disappointment was the crust - it was kind of doughy and just didn't have much flavor, thought they could have done more with it honestly (it was very plain).  I ended up eating mostly the toppings and left much of the pizza dough on the plate.

Extra points for having Coke products, and I will definitely have to return to try the french toast or cinnamon rolls.

I also liked the fact that your ordered & paid at the counter and then they brought your food out to you.  Very efficient and quick.

Overall, 2 thumbs up, and I will be back if I'm in the area for breakfast.",1

I paid $60 for a chihuahua and a yorky, but when I came to pick them both up one of the women said how she ""didn't get to finish Hazard (the chihuahua) because he was freaking out during his cut"". However, I was not offered any of my money back and when I got home and got a closer look my chihuahua was cut in several places (I'll upload photos) and none of them said anything to me about it.

Can't speak for the food as I haven't tried it, but I get boba here all the time. They are always willing to add extra tapioca which is nice. I mostly get the coconut or passion fruit slush, but they have countless other flavors and every single one I have dried is pure deliciousness. 

Tip: It's cash only if the tab is under $5 so bring some bills. Although if you forget they'll sometimes let it slide, but to be nice, I suggest you bring cash. :)",1

trn_5075,"The last time I went to Mimi's Cafe, at 7450 W Bell Rd, Glendale, AZ 85308, was June 29th, my wife's birthday. We arrived at Mimi's at approximately 3:30 PM. The place was empty except for a small section that probably comprised one-quarter of the place. There was a couple waiting where one normally sits to await a table. Jokingly I asked them if they were waiting for a table. They responded, yes, we're waiting for a booth. Still not sure they weren't joking, I told the hostess we're a party of three and we'ed like a booth. The hostess said you'll have to wait after this couple, they're waiting for a booth also. I asked really! This place is empty! I said okay, we'll get a booth at Ajo Al's (a Mexican-American restaurant that shares the parking lot with Mimi's). We walked over to Ajo Al's which was just as empty as Mimi's. The hostess told us to sit where ever we'd like. The waiter was friendly, helpful and very attentive.

The service was terrific. The guys even came outside to help me unload my truck and they counted everything right away - and what's more important is that I received the accurate refund. (my brother is the type who counts the bottles before he sends me). 

I'm often left with the responsibility of returning the goods for cash after some hard parties. I've had issues at other bottle depots... I like that this location is both central and offers great service!!!!",1
trn_5079,"An intriguing concept: Food from areas that the Roman centurions conquered. Places like Achaea (Greece), Hispania (Spain), Gaul (France), Judea (the Middle East), and Britannia (England).

     An intriguing menu:  Mushroom, Goat Cheese and Spinach Strudel ($10); Bricked Fired Poached Tilapia with Sage Butter, served with Coconut and Shrimp Risotto ($23);
Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce ($13).

     An intriguing venue: A tiny place with old world decor - red walls, chandeliers, lots of empty wine bottles on the ledge behind the banquette, and a cute little patio with an amusing statue of a centurion outside the wrought iron fence.

     So what more could you ask? Regrettably, lots...

     We were four, for lunch. Ken and I arrived first and ordered an appetizer of Stuffed Mushrooms wrapped in Prosciutto ($8). It did not arrive until well after our friends, Leon and Sena came in. They wanted to try the Strudel, but were told it wasn't available. Our mushrooms were three of the ugliest lumpy things I've seen in a long time. They had been cooked in the pizza oven which pretty much incinerated the ham and dried out the mushrooms However, with enough of the accompanying Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce spooned over them, they were fairly tasty. Sena got a panini of eggplant in tomato sauce. The eggplant was almost raw, so it was chewy and bitter. Ken ordered Mussels in a Mustard Sauce ($10) served with Endless Bread. The jar of mustard had never found the sauce. Leon asked for a hamburger with ketchup. He was told that no ketchup was served in the restaurant because it would interfere with the bold flavors of the food. I would applaud this as a policy had there been any bold flavors. Ken quipped that most of the food seemed to have its roots in Britannia. My Espana Pizza ($14) had a nice amount of manchengo and mozzarella cheeses, but was pretty low on the chorizo topping.The crust was something of a disaster - burnt on the edges and flabby in the center.

     Service was poor.. With only two other customers in the restaurant, there was no excuse for ice tea glasses that were not refilled until we pointed it out, dishes that were not cleared from the table to make way for new ones, a long wait for Ken's entree to be served after the other three had arrived, and the lack of a bowl to put his mussel shells in. The restaurant also had a general air of sloppiness about it. I don't believe that chef/owner Eric Osburn was in the house while we were there, at least I hope he wasn't. But he needs to be more aware of what's going on when he isn't present.

     Hopefully Centurion will make the effort to live up to its concept, menu and venue. I'd like to be intrigued.",-1

I had just come from the doctor's office and wasn't ""all there"" so I was a little slow and stumbly getting my order together, I admit it.  The lady who took my order seemed so impatient and annoyed with me.  I even apologized as I ordered but no reaction from this woman.  I guess maybe she was having a bad day, too.  See, I can be understanding.  I don't know why she wasn't.",0
trn_5081,"So overall I slightly prefer this location to the Silverado Ranch location. The complex seems a tad bit better maintained, and I find the demographic to be a tad bit more attractive, likely because it's in a slightly more expensive area. One thing that really annoys me is the sauna is only heated to 150-160... which is hardly enough to be useful. Most 24hr heat their sauna to 170-185. I can stay in this sauna for 25 minutes and sweat less than 10 minutes at most other 24 hour fitness saunas. The lack of an effective sauna is why I rate them 3 stars. 

Also, I think they need to check the self-locking lockers more. I can go there at night time where there aren't that many people there, and every single self-locking locker (the one's where choose a code, as opposed to bring a lock) can be locked/taken. So people are either storing their stuff in their, or just keeping them locked. I strongly prefer these lockers but because they are only sometimes available I need to bring my own locker, which is not my preference.

trn_5085,"After reading the 5-star reviews, I was so excited to try this place. We drive by it all the time, so I was hoping we would have a new neighborhood favorite. There are always a lot of cars in the parking lot, so I thought it was a good sign. When we walked in, I realized all the cars belong to the people at the bar. It is a very large bar and was nearly packed with people at 1pm. As we sat down in a booth, we quickly noticed the long looks of the people at the other tables. Someone finally came over to give us a menu and asked the table next to us if they also needed menus too but they said they had been waiting for their food for a long time. They finally got their apps but had to ask for their entrees to go because it was so long of a wait. We finally got our order in and waited and waited and waited. Someone from the bar came out to see how we were and we told her that we were waiting for a long time and my husband needed a refill on his drink. She said she would check on our order and refill the drink, then went behind the bar, put down his cup and asked someone at the bar for his order. She never came back and never went to check on the food. The waitress finally comes back (we're there for 45 minutes at this time) and we ask her to just box up the food because we were getting light headed from the paint fumes. We took the food home and it was just OK. The parmesan fries were pretty good but the onion rings, while a great texture, were way too salty. My BBQ pulled pork was more of a chunks of fatty pork, not pulled but the bun was good. My husband's shrimp po'boy was OK but he didn't think he could taste the shrimp. Good bun, though.

trn_5090,"I love coming to Oishii for my takoyaki and sushi fix. The thing is, you have to adjust your expectations when you come here. They are not comparable to a Japanese or sushi restaurant, but they should be compared to other all you can eat restaurants. In that category, I think they do a good job of maintaining quality, taste and service. They're also one of the only ayce places in the SE. 

In terms of food, I think they have one of the best selections of cooked and raw (sushi) menus for an all you can eat place. They also have a selection of dishes that I've never really seen elsewhere (eg. Natto, creamy yakidon, whole roasted makerel, etc).

 All of their cooked foods are pretty tasty, as are the sushi rolls. My favorites are still the red coral roll, Hollywood roll and fire Kirin roll.

I do think that their portions are often skimping (especially the sashimi, tataki and yuke), but it doesn't usually bother me because I'll order more ahead knowing this. I should clarify, this may not be the case for a la carte, just for ayce. 

Service is also usually really good. The servers are usually very friendly and helpful, especially if you've never gone there before. They're also quite attentive. It never takes too long to get a new order in and food is usually out within 10-15 minutes. 

Overall, come to Oishii if you want a good all-you-can-eat experience and you want to try a bunch of different dishes. Do not come to Oishii expecting a good sushi restaurant; that's not what it is.",1
trn_5091,"On Tuesday, April 24th, we brought my friend's 2018 Audi Q3 in to repair a flat. I told my friend not to remove the nail as air wasn't leaking so we managed to get there without any issues. Before we opened a work order, I asked Bianca if we could now remove the nail to see if it's actually leaking.

We removed the nail and immediately air started to escape. I got reassurance from Bianca that they would inflate the tire before moving the SUV and she said they would definitely do that. Anyone with automotive knowledge knows the dangers of causing degradation to the sidewall. Running a tire flat could reduce the integrity of the tire which could result in an accident if the tire blew out.

So my friend and I leave to go get lunch (I planned on heading home after). We were walking along Yonge and so happen to walk by as the tire guy was moving the SUV into a parking spot (which means he would then have to drive it again into one of the bays). We look closely and the tire is FLAT!!! I confront Bianca about this in the lot and she just keeps telling me, ""It's ok, it's ok."" No apologies. No Bianca, it's not ok. You gave me your word so you knew the importance of inflating the tire and not running it flat!

We were quoted 3-4 hours for the repair. If I weren't dealing with a major concussion from a car accident, I would have stayed around to watch them like a hawk. We walk away. Less than an hour later, we get the call that the vehicle is ready.

In hindsight, I should have spoken to the manager that was there when we cashed out. But I have not been well so wasn't in the right frame of mind. 

I was an apprentice mechanic for years. I still work in the automotive industry. When you catch people cutting corners, you wonder what else goes on that you're not aware of? Thoroughly disappointed because they evidently broke trust by not keeping their word and they were caught in the act.

The cannoli shell itself was heavy, dense, and oily.  Cannoli shells should be light, and somewhat crunchy.  Likewise, the cannoli creme was way too heavy, and something - an element/flavor, a hint of something that isn't easy to pick out, was missing, from the mix.

I heard that Nova's bread is great.  Maybe I'll be back to give that a try...but the cannoli?  No thank you.",-1

trn_5095,"Always a fan of In-N-Out. And being steps from my hotel (the LINQ) lobby, isn't such a bad place to be either. Like all locations, this place is cranking out the food! And being one of the more affordable options on the strip, it's definitely busy at all times of day. 

Seeing I didn't know when we would be making a trip to California again, it was a must to check out the new Promenade location and get my fix while I was in town. First visit I went for my standard Double Double Animal Protein burger and Animal Fries (well done!). Instead of braving the crowd, I took it back up to my room to enjoy in peace. Second visit, I just got a simple double double animal style (no fries); the lettuce wrapping takes a little longer at this location then I've experienced at other ones so I went without this time. 

In-N-Out definitely ranks up there as a must stop whenever I'm in range for a visit.",1

Since I am in the process of moving and selling my home, I wanted to organize and put some things in storage.  I really thought this company was too good to be true, but there is not one bad thing I can say.  Their service is incredible, my items were well taken care of, the pricing is outstanding.

trn_5101,"This theater seems very outdated. The concessions a bit confusing - where do I order and where do I pay? Where do I get napkins and straws?

The seats are old, uncomfortable and stiff. My family and I watched a movie here about a couple of weeks ago. We came home with red bumps on our arms and legs - sure enough they were bedbug bites! Nasty!

They had your traditional Indian offerings out there, such as curry chicken and tandoori chicken, along with some others options that those who might be more versed in Indian cuisine might give a try.

They crank out tons of amazing Sri Lankan food.  You can ask for the spicing to be mild, medium or hot - and hot is very hot.  Place is always busy.",1
trn_5110,"Went for a take-out lunch.  Ordered chicken red curry, medium spice. I found out after I got back to work with my meal that they don't include salad or soup with your take-out order. This is too bad because I was looking forward to that and the price is the same!  Is it that hard to pack a salad or soup?  

Anyway, the red curry sauce was excellent tasting and the spice level was right on. However the chicken tasted a little like freezer burn and was over cooked. The spring roll was very good. 

Overall not a bad lunch but could have been better with the soup and salad and fresher chicken. I was hungry 3 hrs later and for 10 bucks plus 2 dollar tip I wanted a little more. Next time I'll eat it in!",0

trn_5114,"Well, well, well, who do we have here. An awesome little custom motorcycle and service shop without the assholery? How excellent for me.

Given it's the beginning of the riding season, it's time to dust off the ol' hog (it's not a
hog) and get her tuned up.  Having moved from the far SE, I needed a new shop to get my bike serviced at.  I used to go to Redline and they were pretty good, but too far now to get to.  I drove past Lucid recently and saw ""Koffee"" on their sign and knew I had to book in.  They offer a full service deal for $199. This comes with a long laundry list of checks and balances, oil and filter change, chain clean and grease, tire pressure, you name it! You can upgrade your oil to semi synergic for $29.99 or premium oil for $59.99.  I love this place, right from my first phone call with Kurtis to my service today with Kyle, it was an awesome experience. No up sells, just respective kind great service.  Unlike those arseholes at well I won't say.  Ok, it's Blackfoot Motosports.  Anyone who reads my motorbike shop reviews knows I god damn hate that effing place.
So inside LK is a very rad, cool welcoming shop with a coffee shop inside. They have custom (kustom) drinks, cookies, snacks.  They sell patches and custom tanks , lots of cool parts and accessories.  Their custom bikes are shown in front and in the parking lot and they're so fucking cool. Usually when you see custom bikes they're bobbers but I saw a lot of cafe racers too!  My mind began racing but then I remembered I don't want to sleep on the couch this summer. Thank you Lucid for being awesome and helping keep little Sally Street III in tip top shop!  We'll be back soon with our Bouly and some delicious Koffee.  Keep up the good work and stay awesome.  I'm sending everyone your way!",1
trn_5115,Now open on Sundays and they have a marvelous 3 course prix fix menu. I started with the roasted beet wedge salad which was great and I loved the green goddess dressing with blue cheese. My tempura battered fish and chips and slaw was excellent as well and the portion size was generous. I was in a food coma from the first two items so I cant' really remember the desert and I was so full I didn't make much of a dent in it. BYOB makes having a really great wine with a great meal even easier. Service and food is always excellent and now that they are open Sundays there is even more reason to go.,1

trn_5122,"Adam Maynard, the owner of Global Minds, has a gift for hiring great teachers.  He finds native speaking teachers that create a caring and fun environment for the children and through his leadership he is able to retain them year after year.  

I have one daughter that was enrolled in his after-school tutoring program and a younger daughter who is entering her third year at Global Minds.  I have toured all the language preschools in the area and have also been a board member on a school board for a language immersion elementary school and feel Global Minds rises above the other language preschools choices because the school:

1. Engages in creative craft projects that foster language and fine motor growth.
2. Meets each child at their skill level 
3. Genuinely cares for each child
4. Is successful in teaching children foreign language skills
5. Aids in the growth of children both socially and academically

Last year I reached out to Adam to thank him for another great year and that my daughter was so happy and he wrote back to me and said ""I was just telling my friend that I have the greatest job in the world!""

That said, the last time we played, it was in terrible shape.  There were burnt out spots on the fairways, and even on many of the greens.  The practice green was largely brown as well.

When we were seated it was pretty vacant and we were told of 3 servers by our host but we weren't helped for a cool minute . The server had a very pretentious attitude as if this jobs beneath him. He asked what Drinks we wanted before ever giving us menus . I had to ask for the appetizer because that wasn't offered or even mentioned. When we ordered the specials also weren't mentioned . 
It almost feels as if there was instant judgement but as Vegas locals sometimes you just don't want to dress up . ‍ 

The food is like 4 stars at least . The service is like 3 , at best 3.5 . Maybe the server (all 3?) we're having a bad day and their vibes were off...or he just didn't fake the judgement . Idk . I do know as a server for many years, you make tips based off personality , professionalism, & overall energy.",0

Tacos were good - filling - and I loved that you could add what you wanted though it can be a bit overwhelming to have so many options, and a bit confusing for your first visit.

trn_5140,"Went on a summer Monday evening at 8.  No waiting, but was busy.  The host was a bit odd. It's like he was nice and cocky at the same time. I told him we had 3 (I walked in by myself as the others parked).  He asked if the rest of my party was with me. I told him they were parking and his tone changed and he said, 'I was just asking.' Which made me do a double take and wince my eyes as in, did you just talk to me like that!  So I had to reply with, 'okaaayyy, I was just answering your question.""

So, moving on past that bit of uncomfortableness...we were seated.  Now granted, it was 85 degrees out.  But they have a ceiling full of fans that were on high.  I was freezing.  But you know it's bad when my husband and my   15 year old, 6 foot, 200lb rugby player, are shivering and complaining of how cold it is.  We mentioned to one of the servers about it being cold, and she said they could lower the fans but not turn them off.  It helped a little.  Was surprised no one else sitting had asked about that.

The service was a tad slow. Didn't bother us , it was busy.  I think we took one of the last tables.  All the tables outside in front were taken as well.  

On to food.
Unsweetened ice tea was good.  I always comment about the ice tea, because some places have bad ice tea with bad after taste.  This one was good.
We got the Mac-n-cheese bites as an app.  I expected small little half dollar sized things like you get at most places. But not here!  You get 4 good sized ""bites""!  Each one was like a mini meal in itself.  They are served with some sort of yummy cheesy sauce on the plate too..OMG, these were the best ever!!! We loved them!

However, moving on to the sandwiches was disappointing.  I got the summer chicken sandwich. I did take off the top bread and eat it with a fork and knife, but damn was it DELICIOUS!!  That was not the disappointing part.  Now I must point out that I had been to the original melts in Lakewood years ago. The crazy wait times and the tasteless dough/carb wad the parmegeddon I had there turned me off to ever going back for the last few years.  But now I'll keep coming back as long as they keep the summer chicken (hint hint: please keep through the winter too!).  Now the problem happens with my husbands and 15 year olds sandwiches.  The novelty of there giant bread cheese sandwiches is just that, it's a novelty that everyone seems to buy into and keep this place busy.  But like I said, we didn't, after that 1st experience, it kept us away for years!  But here we go again, reminded of the issue with the sandwiches.  My husband got the chicken and waffles grilled cheese.  It looked great.  The problem, it was bland and tasteless! All that bread took away from it.  The same with my 15 year olds mushroom grilled cheese.  He was disappointed in lack of taste.  I think they need to consider focusing on ramping up taste in the middle of the sandwich so it comes through all the bread, and perhaps also consider doing open face melts!!! A nice cheesy bread base with some awesome tasty fixings on top eaten w/a fork and knife.  Save the bread! Forget the top layer of bread!!  

In the end, I'll be back for those bites and that summer chicken.  And the hubby and teen will probably try something else if not they will get that summer chix too.",0

I got a small sausage and mushroom pizza.  Didn't like the toppings at all.  The mushrooms had a very strange and off-putting texture and color.  I suspect they were slice canned mushrooms, because I've had lots of fresh mushroom pizzas and they have NEVER looked or tasted like that before.  Bad start.

The flavor of the sausage was totally carried by salt... it tasted like salt and sausage-texture.

But -- otherwise, the sauce and flavor were pretty good, and the crust not bad.  It's chewy, though, not really my favorite style.  I think I could have enjoyed the pizza if I didn't get the particular toppings I chose.

I'd maybe get pizza here again if I had to feed a crowd or if I were drunk, but I'll stick to cheese or pepperoni next time.  To be fair, it is pretty good bang for your buck (the small pizza is substantial and around $8 with two toppings!)",0

trn_5148,"A few years ago when this place first opened my wife and I were excited because there weren't very many restaurants in the area.  We went in to order our first Rosati's Pizza but when we presented them with our ""Entertainment Book"" coupon (kids sell these books as fundraisers) they stated they don't take those coupons. (It is true their store wasn't listed on the back but we thought it was cause the store was so new). When we pressed them they plainly stated that they didn't have to take coupons because they are so busy.  We decided we didn't need to eat there and left.

Well, several years have gone by now and we haven't been back to Rosati's but the wait at our favorite Italian place was over an hour for take out last night (I won't tell you the name because its already too crowded).  We weighed our options and went through our ""Entertainment book"" and found Rosati's.  It is close to the house so we decided we'd give them another chance.  Upon arrival we noticed that this location is still not listed on the back. I decided I would just ask if they accept it and if they don't we'll leave again - probably never to return.  The cashier politely said they don't accept the coupon but she could offer me a 30% discount instead.  This sounded reasonable to me so we decide to order.

We got the 18"" thin crust (+pepperoni +sausage) pizza with a dozen mild wings with Blue Cheese dressing. The pizza was really good.  It had more cheese than my wife likes but I like lots of cheese.   The wings were pretty good too (a bit thin but nice and crispy).  The dressing seemed a bit old with a dry film forming on the top so we didn't eat it.  I'll give them a pass on that - as long as it doesn't happen again.

Overall, this was a good experience with good food.  The cashier was really friendly and won this business a customer. 

The pizza prices are a bit higher than the other near-by places and you must get he pizza to go.  If your looking to eat-in, try Barro's Pizza across the street - their pizza is good too.",1
trn_5149,"The bar has been raved about in the community for the last 40 years, but I've always been underwhelmed the half dozen times I ventured in to the place during that time. 

The first thing that is off putting for me is that they are dyed in the wool old school Madisonians who love various forms of Americana that I detest (folk, blues, bluegrass, and old time--50s--rock that is quite tepid). The music and the ugly little supper club dining hall where it is staged is always awful. 

Yesterday, I decided to give the place another chance while enjoying opening day of pro basketball season. The bar has only 3 TVs and does somewhat cater to a sports crowd, but no one in the very busy place was watching the World Series. We arrived just as the Bucks game was to begin and my friend--a very well known regular at the bar--asked if the nearby TV could be changed to our local game as he ordered food and our first round. He asked again 20 minutes later as he got another round for himself. He asked again 10 minutes later when our waitress brought the food. 

She did finally make the effort to change the channel at that point, but she failed to tune in to FOX Sports Midwest--a network they have on their cable system, as every Brewers game during the summer is showing in this bar--instead inexplicably tuning in to the NBA Network (a travesty in its own right, as they've begun showing fragments of every game each night interspersed with commentary from their studio 'experts'; it's like sitting around with an autistic child who is flipping between channels randomly). 

It takes ONE SECOND to click a remote. Considering that I was not there to eat and was there to have a couple of beers and watch this game, this is the height of horrible customer service. If you are a bar that has televisions dedicated to sports and someone comes up to 'order' it is your obligation to do this minor and not very time consuming task FIRST (even if you don't know the exact cable number, which EVERY EMPLOYEE in such an establishment SHOULD have memorized to best serve their clientele, it shouldn't take more than another 10 seconds to find it on the cable menu). 

Additionally, just before we were moving to a table nearer to the bar and TVs as the crowd began to thin, an elderly, bearded drunk who may live above the bar came over to our table alone and asked the 4 of us if we were parked illegally outside and being ticketed. We all said that we weren't, and he then stared at me with malevolence and said, ""You, I know you're going to go far in life.""

It turned out that I did receive a $30 ticket for parking 'illegally' in a spot that should be legal parking and was not clearly marked (the curbs on those side streets are not painted yellow, and the spot I occupied had two driveways side by side ahead of me and the sign indicating with an arrow as 'No Parking from here to the corner' a full 50 feet ahead of where I had parked and not easily visible) One wonders why the city doesn't paint those curbs AND/OR put the sign at the beginning of the no parking zone instead of in a nearly invisible (overhanging trees obscure it) place more than 50 feet from the no parking zone (I guess they love their little parking traps on these side streets for the revenue it bilks out of unwary drivers). 

I suspect that this man is the neighborhood busybody, drunkenly calling the cops every time someone parks there (maybe he even gets kickbacks!). He acted weirdly familiar and threw an insult at me that suggests he saw me park there and followed me in to the bar (Parking Enforcement goes off duty in Madison at 5:00, while I parked there at 6:35 and was ticketed at 7:17, and the chances of it being a random drive through of a quiet residential street by the actual MPD seems very, very, very unlikely). 

Why would anyone ever delight in this shitty little neighborhood bar (that is far worse than any of the dives on Atwood that have become gentrified, even if those bars were also horrible)?

It seems to be the bad, ugly Sconnie bar for those in this 'hood who are too good for the old dives or the sports bar just down the way. 

I'll never go back, as I've never had good service, the food is no better than any bar food, the music is awful and the parking situation is a travesty.  It cost me $42 to have two beers and to NOT GET TO SEE even 5 minutes of the game that I requested that they air.",-1

trn_5151,"Choolah is like Indian street food + chipotle to me. I love the ambiance and interiors and the service has consistently been good. It's not really like home cooked Indian food - though it is equally good, just different good. You walk in, order at front desk, when buzzer buzzes you go grab your food and sit wherever you like (inside or sunroom-ish or outside).

For apps/to share, we like their Samosa Chaat. Four smaller samosas (than usual) with chutneys - a good starter.

I am a big fan of their BBQ meals - my fav combo is chicken with wheat naan and chickpea masala. I love their hot sauce. They have recently changed how their chicken BBQ/tandoori is served/cut. I wish they'd go back to how it was before.

Their biryani is very good too. I wish it was served with a bigger serving of raita.

And when done eating (or before) do check out their hand wash jacuzzi. Restrooms are always clean. Parking is easy and abundant. 

So, do I like it - yeah! Would I keep going back - yes! Is there room for improvement - yup! Go visit Choolah if you haven't already and do say hello to eeny, meeny, miny, moe!",1
trn_5152,"I don't tend to leave negative reviews but I felt in this situation I would. Please keep in mind this is in reference to the new location on south ft Apache. I decided to get a quick car wash before work one day and my mirror was cracked and chipped. As I approached the car wash I pulled my mirror in on my side per the sign. I went into place and the machine started to run around my truck as expected. On the way back up from the rear of my truck the edge of the washer barely touched the mirror edge and jarred it pretty hard. I didn't think much of it until I got out and wiped the truck down with towels. The manager was polite, said she watched the video and believed me that the mirror was damaged. She couldn't see it on the video but would forward to the corporate office. I offered to go find the glass in the machine but she refused saying she believed me and it wasn't an issue. I waited 3 weeks to hopefully get a courtesy call or maybe an email as I gave my business card to the manager. I went in to the store, very polite and asked for an update. The manager on site (male) said there is signs up and that they are not responsible, have a good day. Life goes on and I will have to pay for the mirror out of my own pocket as I drive a company truck. Not a huge deal as Christmas comes, 2 boys and a new born and a house payment. Decisions that can be made to keep an image and to just do the right thing were not made. I just bought a house in this area and already have a bad taste in my mouth about this property. 75 dollars in gas 2x a week not to mention any other items we need to go to the local gas stations for will be lost. Hope this helps you with making future decisions like the poor one you made with me. Hundred dollar mirror probably just lost you thousands in lost gas purchases.",-1
trn_5153,"RM Seafood is really underrated.  I don't get it.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!!!  It is expensive for sure, which is why I recommend that you try it the first time for lunch!  They have a $28 lunch tasting menu.  The Clam Chowder at RM Seafood is amazing. Definitely the best I have ever had anywhere! I'm not kidding, better than anything I have had in Boston or San Francisco or other great Seafood cities.  I liked it so much I asked for the recipe and they gave it to me!!!  The Lobster Rolls and the Korean Flat Iron Steak are great as well. They do some creative things with their desserts as well definitely try the Ice Cream tasting and Key Lime Pie!! I have been there several times. Go there at lunch instead of dinner. The prices are about half as much for pretty much the same dishes. The service is also excellent!",1

So while I was running errands in the area, I made the hubby go in and pick up some croissants to try.  These croissants were amazing!  Light and flakey and full of buttery goodness!  I'm pretty sure that it partly had to do with them being fresh from the oven as well.    I wish that I lived closer so I could eat these croissants whenever I wanted.  But I'm sure my pants love that I live that far away.",1

Hair cut was quick, cut was right to the point.   And the price was very good for what you get.  $30 for just a cut and no wash.  They do take appointments ahead of time if you do not want to wait at all.  They will also give you a cute juice box on top of that, which i thought was a cute touch.

Even though we had some ""issues"" with some of the staff I can assure you that the staff here are great.

This place has valet parking only but you can park at the congress centre across the street.

This location is a great hub between Chinatown and the old port.  Don't eat breakfast here, it really sucks.

Of course my favorite server is Christy as she usually brings us some nice, warm, free cookies for dessert.  Christy's cookies are the best, no euphemisms here!

Most of the food has been pretty good, my faves so far are the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Ahi Tuna Sandwich.  Mmmm, I wish I was eating some now instead of this cold pizza hut, yuck!

I enjoyed all of the wraps except for the fajita wrap, ugh, hard to explain but it sort of had a slimy texture.  Just not too good.

Most items come with fries or you can upgrade for a 50 cent charge to curly fries, onion rings  or several other items.

Today I had the french dip.  Pretty standard operating procedure here except for the Flamin Hot Cheetos battered onion rings that accompany the sandwich.  Sounds awesome right?  Using something that's been fried as batter so that you can fry it again.  I have to hand it to them, it's a great concept.  The execution, however, isn't quite there.  These should be orgasmic and they just sort of taste like onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, I like getting my O Ring face on but I thought these would be better.",1
trn_5165,"Best brunch ever? Best Brunch ever! 

And I can't say that lightly as we love brunch and have been to some of the top places in the top cities for brunch.

Basically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried! 

The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome! 

My pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast! 

Other pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!",1

I'm a big fan of red bean and they provide it as a topping to the dessert which I highly enjoyed. It also comes with two mochi balls and a yellow nut of some sort. If you love matcha and green tea flavored things definitely come visit this establishment. They opened just in time for the hot Vegas days!",1

I had a late landing here and wanted to grab something to eat before heading to my hotel. Burger King was one of the few options available (if not the only one).  The cashier was filthy (hands/shirt), and could barely understand my order. He got it wrong and proceeded to argue with me until I said I wasn't paying $4.00 for a plain cheeseburger (it was $2.50). Finally, he called his supervisor who sorted it out (he thought I had ordered a double).  Ugh. Frustration after a flight is the last thing you need.

trn_5169,"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     48/100

Finally got the chance to check this place out. I haven't been to Meadows Mall in a long time! Some things have changed since the last time I was here. Haven't had ""Real Hawaiian Shave Ice"" since I was back home on Oahu, 6+ years ago. 

Heard a lot about this place from my cousins, who come here often. 
""Bettah than the place at container park."" After trying this place out, ""Yes, I can say it is."" They have more options and flavors to add to the shave ice. And more aloha spirit, it adds to the authenticity. 

They have other cold dessert options, such as Dole Whip, Thrifty Ice Cream, milkshakes, malts, floats, dole float, hot fudge sundae but your best bet here is the shave ice. The other ones you can find else where, but if you're in the mall and craving for something other than shave ice, go for it. 

They have a variety of toppings: mochi, condensed milk, dole whip, sour spray, li hing mui powder, strawberry/raspberry sauce, Ghirardelli chocolate syrup. 

The only thing that's missing which would make it more authentic is having azuki beans as a topping. 

The guy at this location, was for real a local braddah from Hawai'i. Super friendly and we chatted with him while we sampled some of the shave ice flavors. He definitely had the Aloha Spirit. Although he's lived in Las Vegas for 14 years he still had a strong Hawaiian Pidgin accent. It was nice to hear. I miss it. I don't hear it that often. 

Sorry, I forgot a photo of the shave ice. I only had a few spoons of it because I'm trying to watch my sugar intake (diabetes). 

This place made me miss home. Will be back soon!

TIP: They have Melona, POG (Passion Orange Guava) & Tiger's Blood syrup! 

TIP: There are two locations at the Meadows Mall, only locations in Vegas right now. One is in the food court near the mall entrance with more seating. The one we went to was the one downstairs in the middle of the mall near Bath & Body Works and The Disney Store.",1
trn_5170,"I was in the mood for Chinese food and this place was on my radar.  I really wanted to like this place, but it failed in almost every aspect.  This is my first two star review as I give almost every restaurant the benefit of the doubt and acknowledge that they must be doing something right to stay in business.

Upon waking in I didn't know if I should seat myself or wait to be seated.  No one approached me immediately, but I patiently waited for someone to greet me and be seated.  I really should have turned around at that moment, but decided to give it a shot.  

I ordered a meal that came with a soupy/slurpee/sludgy egg drop soup, soggy cream puff, decent egg roll, boring brown rice, and flavorless kung pao entree.  Really was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.

During my meal I noticed the servers were unprofessionaly lounging at a table that had a bag of half eaten doritos.  Texting on their phone, and not paying attention to the customers.  The place is dirty and has clutter near the kitchen.  My advice is to clean up a little of that clutter and shut the door to the not so nice looking kitchen.

trn_5171,"Having tried ""The Hearth"" at various meal occasions in the US departures Terminal One at Pearson Airport; I wanted so much for it to succeed as it tried to be different from the rest of the airport eateries headlined by a celebrity chef. One Disappointment after another, today's visit was consistent with that trend!

Walking in at 7am, with a connecting flight stateside at an adjacent gate;  I was determined to give this restaurant another Try, despite my previous not-so-good visits, as i had an hour to kill and it was right next to where I need to board.  

The breakfast menu, although overpriced, was tempting with its Hearth french toast ($15) And, scrolling down in the sides section, for a tempting bagel & cream cheese ($6).  The french toast was so fancifully described that I soldiered on and went right in.

This is supposed to be an "" upscale "" experience to commensurate with the menu prices and ""ambiance""; but the service was nothing short of a much slower greasy spoon.  

It took just over 40 minutes for my french toast to arrive.  It was a thick slice of dry brioche bread, a shaving layer of visible egg with a dollop of vanilla yogurt (it was described as mascarpone cheese but they probably ran. Out?), two small frozen individual blackberries; 1 small frozen strawberry cut in half and 6 Tiny little blueberries with a 1 0z ceramic cuppie of syrup for ($15)

A few minutes later, my bagel with cream cheese came in ($6).  It was an ordinary sesame bagel that was steamy mushy.  The top portion steamed microwave style light and untouched; the bottom part slightly beigey brown and mushy; what probably happened is they sped up the toaster grill to get it out faster since service was sooooooo slow.  The cream cheese was salty with a herb blend I didn't ask for, i expected just plain old cream cheese.

After this irritating experience, it was taking forever to get my bill or the wait staff's attention that was busy chit- chatting.  I would expect this at IHOP or Denny's but not at this celebrity Lynn whatever her name is, supposedly upscale restaurant.  Come to think of it, they need an IHOP at YYZ:  ""hello hello? Come on Pearson Airport, are
You listening?helllo?""

and with that thought, and that slowness, waiting for the bill and thinking of IHOP or just a normal toasted Tim Hortons or Starbucks  bagel that I could have gotten a few doors down To my left,  I was startled all of a sudden!

When family comes into town from San Diego, they usually meet us here...as in they don't even want to come to our house to drop their luggage off. Lately, this has us wondering, are they here to see us or are they here for the Metro Pizza?? They demand we eat here at least 2x per visit. Just the other day, my husband used the Pasta Pie (a must try) as a fantasy football trade incentive. The pizza is that powerful. The latest pizza we ordered--with the always perfect, thick metro crust, had to be the best ever. The crust was so perfect; thick but airy, crisp yet soft.

Day 1 of moving in we saw hair all over the bedding, dirty toilets,  spiders/centipede/lady bugs everywhere. The microwave  stopped working after a few days, and when they replaced it,  it was dirty.  And the maintenance person who replaced it while we were out left our front door cracked open instead of closing/locking it.  That's not safe at all!!! The fire alarm went off twice in only the master bedroom on the same day and scared the heck out of us and our 2 toddlers.  No heads up was given so that we could've at least taken them out while it happened.

That being said, nothing spectacular was served. I had the corned beef hash, which was not from a can but overwhelmingly salty. The hash itself and an egg would have been sufficient, but they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I thought that sounded decadent, but it didn't translate well as the hash had been thoroughly killed with half a pint of salt. 
It's an okay alternative to waffle house or ihop, but it's not worth the 30 minute wait I experienced for a table.",0

They asked what kind of phone I had and I told them a 6S, the person I spoke with said it could be fixed and it would be $109.  I asked what time they opened on Sunday and they told me 11.  I planned my day around going in at 11 so I could have my phone fixed.  I arrived and they told me they could not fix an iPhone 6S.  It's on their website that they can and the employee working Saturday night said they could, yet they can't.  Had I known last night that they couldn't fix it I would have made other arrangements for it today.  

Please make sure your website is accurate and your employees are trained so people like me don't waste their time with your store.",-1
trn_5188,Stop by here today while visiting Canada. The store was located across the street from my hotel. The Yelp reviewers hyped me up to thinking the food was awesome. The people that own the place was super nice. I received my order in a good timely matter but that's where the good talking stops. The food tasted over cooked and bland absolutely no seasoning at all then I order a few fresh spring rolls and got back to my hotel and found there was no peanut sauce...that's the icing on the cake with a cherry on top. Bottom line I was not impressed and will not be returning,-1
trn_5189,"Really sad to see this place go downhill. It was phenomenal at a point in time, but not making this a regular stop anymore. 

Ate here when it first opened and a few times since. Noticed many aspects of the food and service were off last time, hoped it would improve. 

Made a reservation online and showed up on time. Table wasn't ready and we were refused to be seated for ~10 minutes after our confirmed time. Not a biggie but noticed many tables were open. 

Primary concern was the food. Food took almost 30 minutes to arrive. Some of the chicken was under seasoned and soggy. Biscuits were yeasty, doughy, and undercooked. Surprising for their signature dish. Mentioned it to the server and no resolution was offered. Service was at best 15 minute refills, never came to check in on the food. 

Took 15 minutes to pay the bill. It was apparent at that point they were understaffed. 

Really unfortunate but will never eat here again. All the guests were bummed as I had set expectations high.",-1
trn_5190,Called ahead of time to see if they were able to get my tires on my dirt bike replaced and installed. Even thought they were short handed they were able to do it within a few hours. Now I have fresh shoes! Just in time for the track tomorrow!,1
trn_5191,"Food - 3.7/5 : We had the Summerlicious menu. Nice plating, generous portion, and good taste.

Value- 4.5/5 : $15 lunch Summerlicious menu was an excellent value.

Ambience - 4/5 :Modern and clean. 

Service - 2/5 : Not sure whether the waitress was discriminating against people who order Summerlicious (plus against people who don't order wines), but she has never refilled our water without us asking her first (twice). She took our plates without asking us whether we were finished with our plates (twice - both times, we were actually still working on them). Total of $33.90 for two Summerlicious lunch was the bill (again, great value). I put a $50 dollar bill and waited for the waitress. Here is the conversation:

Waitress (Alexandra): Do you need change?

Me: Umm,, yes please. (what do you think? Do you think I will tip 50%  after ordering Summerlicious??)

Waitress: How much do you want back? 

Me: Um.... (???)

Waitress: Do you want the exact change back??

Me: Yes please.

Waitress: Or you can just tell me how much you need back.

Me: Um... OK. Let's see,, you can give me $12 back (I decided not to tip her well due to her abrupt and aggressive way of asking for tip). 

Waitress: Oh OK. But I have to give you with lots of changes. Is that still OK? 

Me: Um... sure (what other options do I have? Not getting the change back??) 

Waitress: Oh Ok. Here is two, four, six, eight, ten, eleven and twelve.

Me: Thanks.

Waitress: Yep.


On the other hand, the gentleman who served us the pizza was very professional and friendly (I think he might be the owner). 


-----------

As a whole, even though I really liked the food, the value and the ambience of this place, I am not sure I would go back anytime soon due to the serivce and aggressive attitude of the waitress (Alexandra). 

PS: Look, if you are going to discriminate against people who go there for the Summerlicious deal without ordering drinks, why don't you just write a note on the menu saying ""If you order the Summerlicious menu, you better add a drink to it."" Or even easier, just don't participate in the Summerlicious. My two cents.

trn_5193,"Tucked in the neighbouring streets of St. Dominique is the La Chapelle theatre hosting off- just for laughs events 2017. A 10 min walk from the Sherbrooke metro stop, this location was easy to find. A cash only bar and a lounging area with no ATM on site or close by . The theatre itself was small and intimate-I loved it because it connected the artist to the crowd of 50+ people. The comedian, Diane Smith, described it as having a medieval feel theatre where  a lion could come out to battle till death. Haha so true because of its rich history and character!

Loved it the venue - totally would come back !",1
trn_5194,"This restaurant seems to have undergone a recent name change from Kyozon to L'Atelier D'Argentine (although the credit card receipt still shows Kyozon). This was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Highlights include the following:  1. Slow, inattentive service with very few customers there. 2.  Inedible food, bearing little resemblance to anything of any quality from Argentina. And 3. Dirty tableware.  The bottle of Malbec was good, if that was any consolation. Easily amongst my five worst dining experiences.",-1
trn_5195,Grossly underrated place! It takes a little while to get the food but that's because they seem to make a lot of it from scratch. I've been here twice and tried a total of 7-8 dishes. All have been fantastic.,1
trn_5196,I went there with my coworkers for lunch last week. The first thing i noticed was when I walked in the floors were sticky. I am guessing it was the type of cleaner they used because it looked clean but just sounded like I was walking on tacky paper. Food was ready pretty quick (I ordered the #6). I realized the Sierra Mist lacked the sweet syrup taste and it tasted like club soda instead. The woman came by and informed me they just changed the Sierra Mist machine and Offered to replace my soda. The food was good. I rated at as a 3 because I guess I was expecting it to be much better. I will probably go back but it would not be my first choice.,0
trn_5197,"First, if you are staying in Old Montreal, this is NOT close and there are many good/better restaurants closer.  That said, if you are staying in the area, it's not a bad choice.  Onion Soup had enough onion (hard to find), but was missing key spices.  Salads looked good.  One odd thing: the English menu wasn't current. In short, OK, but there are better.",0
trn_5198,"Not so good halo halo... sorry.  It was quite dry and the flavors weren't all that interesting to me.  The colors were artificial and the textures were hard to digest.

I came here just for my halo halo craving, and it didn't go so well.  Maybe go for some of the other sweets... but I don't think I'd be back.",-1
trn_5199,"Group of 4 ... lite eaters this time around so ordered three entrees and fried rice.  General Tso's chicken, very good.  Pepper Beef - different than I expected  - much more sauce but good flavors, but lots of veggies which is good.  Kung Pao chicken was very good - lots of veggies and the chicken tastes fresh and tender.  Great.  Loved the fried rice, though I thought it was a bit understated - perhaps thats my typical expectation to ""american"" Chinese food.  My only complaint is the prices seem a bit high ... $4.50 for soup for one, almost 5 dollars for an egg roll, and most entrees approach $20/plate.   Nice ambiance, but you pay for it.  Service was great.  No left overs though ... so portions tend to be smaller than I typically find.  

If the price is ok for you, you can't go wrong.",1
trn_5200,"As a fanboy, we booked the museum/interactive exhibit at Treasure Island called Avengers Station.  A nice daytime activity in Vegas to nerd out a bit! You'll get a better price through Tix4Tonight than through Yelp Check-in, plus free rental of their headset and handheld device for navigating through the exhibit.  If you're a fan of Marvel Comics, you'll definitely like this exhibit.  There's quite a bit of reading material and interactive exhibits, both from the fictional aspects of comic books along with some real factual, interesting material from a high-school/undergraduate course in biology, physics, astronomy, etc. You know, STEM stuff.

Things I liked:
* The Iron Man exhibit with all those cool armors.  The simulator game makes you feel suited up into his helmet where you're flying first person and targeting enemies by moving your eyes only and firing by blinking fast. I got a lousy 40% hit rate.

* As a big STEM fan, I liked the scientific stuff folded into the Marvel Universe: The Hulk exhibit had good info on radiation and brain chemistry, Thor exhibit for astronomy, and Iron Man for engineering and physics.  Those interactive posters were pretty cool.

Things that can be done better:
* The final ""mission"" game could have been so much funner if the technology was closer to the Nintendo Wii. You were basically trying to shoot down Ultron and his minions with the handheld device but it didn't seem to have good tracking and I wasn't sure the fire button was really doing anything.

Overall, a fun place to check out.  Maybe comparable to a visit to Madame Tussaud Wax Museum, but if you like to slowly browse and read lessons on STEM and learn deeply about your favorite Marvel characters, this is definitely funner.",0
trn_5201,Very disappointed. We had been here before and it was awesome - we invited friends to joins us. How embarrassing!! We were a party of 5 and told there was a 30 minute wait. An hour later and after two other large (younger) parties were seated before us we were finally seated and only after we complained. Ordered cheese dip which arrived with no chips - they arrived much later. I ordered nachos with found beef - they may have had a tablespoon of beef. We will not return here.,-1
trn_5202,"service was fast and friendly. 
The food was delicious and big portions. 
The Combo plate beef and chicken could have fed two of us. I had another dinner in the to go box. 
The sushi was fresh and flavorful. 
The Hawaiian drink was very refreshing. 
The beef was tender and flavorful. The rice and Macaroni salad was also very tasty. 
This spot is definitely worth the 5 minute drive off of the 15 freeway. 
I will be back.",1
trn_5203,"Wonderful staff and stylish, modern rooms!!  I recently stayed here while in town for a wedding and we checked in late. A very nice gentleman greeted us and we were offered our pick of rooms.  We chose a room on the first floor near the workout area and pool entrance, and I was very pleased with the modern design. The king bed was very comfy and I liked the, again comfy, couch and work station.  But I especially want to commend the staff of this hotel for making us feel at home and being very friendly. When I came home after my stay I realized I had left a necklace that was very dear to me at the hotel.  I called, Shyla answered, and she gave me great news!  Our housekeeper turned my necklace in and they had it in storage. They mailed it back to me in L.A.  This hotel is A-OK!  :)",1

trn_5206,"Jen and I walked down a long mulched farm road lined by trees.  It felt as if we weren't in Phoenix anymore.  Well, except for the burning desert sun overhead.

On the farm road there were a handful of dining options.  Our selection was Morning Glory Cafe.

There were lots of cute outdoor tables, some with umbrellas, scattered in a little garden courtyard.  Servers were mulling about offering muffins and scones from large baskets as you looked over your menu.  Unlike bread at many restaurants these carbs ain't free.  we were told to help ourselves to drinks.  Nearby, there were spigotted vessels with coffee, water, lemonade, and a unsweetened flavoured iced tea.  Again, you will be charged for these later.

Perusing the menu, we were torn because everything looked delicious. There were a handful of omelettes, eggs benedict, french toast, and even a french toast monte cristo.  You could also order beverages not on spigot, like fresh squeezed oj and mimosas (i think these were $7.50) from this menu.

Sticking with self-serve drinks, Jen ordered a South Mountain Omelette which came with rosemary roasted potatoes and an herb biscuit.  I ordered morning glory benedict minus the ham, which came with accoutrement of rosemary potatoes but no biscuit.  It seemed like our food came a few minutes after ordering it.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced.

Jen's omelette had green peppers, red peppers, snap peas, tomatoes, swiss chard, and farmer's cheese ontop,  She said, ""This is the best omelette ever.""  My eggs benedict (i'm a fan of benedicts) had perfectly poached eggs voluptuously mounting a tomato, on an english muffin bed, a dark green blanket of spinach draped over shoulders, and one of the best hollandaises ladeled ontop of it all.  It was delicious.  Also delicious was the rosemary roasted potatoes.  However, the biscuit was incredibly dry, so it was like mixing Quickrete(r) in yo mouf. (yes, i just said yo mouf)

It was very good food overall though with the eggs coming straight outta the hen house a few yards away and the veggies hailing from the equidistant farmer's market.  These fresh local ingredients make a big difference.

Morning Glory Cafe would make a great place to take out of town guests, family, bedheaded lovers, or hungover friends.",1
trn_5207,"Our server was awesome, very nice girl and incredible helpful because I am terribley indecisive. The food was good and we didnt have to wait for the check. all in all a good experience.",1
trn_5208,"I found the Fractured Prune while nosing around online from California.  I am visiting NC for the holidays and I just had to try it once I got out here. The idea was just too intriguing.

Donuts are a little small but warm which is nice...

We ordered a variety.. including lemonade, strawberry shortcake, french toast, trail mix, creamsicle... and more.   See online for the menu and what each of these consists of.  

The toppings are really WAY too tooth-achingly sweet for me but I do see the merit in the dip to order format.  It's a lot of fun.  My 4 year old nieces LOVED it...as did my mother and sister.

We also ordered some egg sandwiches to start since none of us had eaten breakfast (before the nieces early morning preschool holiday program) and truthfully they left something to be desired.  My egg and cheese on rye was pre-fabbed and not very tasty... as was my dad's egg, sausage and cheese on rye.  

The (slight) exception was my mom's ""breakfast club sandwich"" on a bagel, which was piled high with HUGE amounts of thin sliced ham and bacon on top of the (rather pre-fabbed) egg.  It was pretty obnoxious and enough for two people... but tasty.

Secretly I do want to try the donut breakfast sandwich, with egg and sausage.  Argh.  Imagine the salty sweet goodness...     but I'm not gonna go there...for fear of my girlish figure.

So I guess the bottom line here is that the thing to stick with is the donuts, for a silly treat, and not the breakfast sandwiches.   Though we did not try the lunch sandwiches, so I can't comment on those. 

The service was nice. Everyone is very friendly. Kudos to them.

I was good with one run but if you have a MAJOR sweet tooth, this is the donut shop for you.",0
trn_5209,"They make a great cake called the jelly roll.  I am a sweet tooth myself, but most of the other cakes to be extremely sweet. 

You can find some specialty foods at this grocery store which you can't find at other stores, which is nice.  But like with many things at the store, you'll be paying a premium for it. 

They have a beautiful selection of fresh flower arrangements, and some potted plants.  They sometimes have 50% off some bouquets which arr no longer on the freshest side.

Overall, I enjoy going here and enjoy trying out their baked goods.  I just find some stuff to be overpriced.",0
trn_5210,"Always wanted to try this place...now that I have I'm good, no special reason to come back.  I had a Waffel and to be honest it tasted like a pancake.  My wife had a BLT and I guess that was good.  Overall experience doesn't warrant a return visit...sorry black bear.",0
trn_5211,"This was the first time with the wife here. Food was good with big portions and Dominic was great along with the rest of the staff. The nitro stout was great! Come on in and ask for Dom, that is what I am doing every time I come to Lazy Dogs.",1
trn_5212,"So glad my husband and I stumbled across this place.  We both loved the atmosphere and it was very cozy.

The place is bigger than you think.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different  bourbon drinks being made.  I absolutely loved that the drinks were served in a mason jar.  Even the ice wasn't standard cubes but were oversized cubes or a sphere depending on your drink choice.  I had the blackberry bourbon lemonade and the southern peach.  Both drinks were wonderful and while having a lot of flavors, the bourbon was able to be showcased.  

They have a large beer menu as well.

The deviled eggs were delicious and not just your standard devil egg.  They were full of flavor and very elaborate in there presentation.

For the main course we got the fried chicken and the mamas chicken biscuits.  The chicken is SO good.  Fried just enough for flavor but so tender!  The chicken biscuits were amazing!

Although the we had tried so much stuff, we couldn't help but get dessert to go.  Chocolate bread pudding and butterscotch cake.  Both had unique flavors and were great. 

You can't go wrong trying this place out.  The extensive southern choices along with great service gives you a hometown feel while being in Vegas. Everyone was friendly and knowledgable; as each plate is delivered they describe each item.  Top notch!",1
trn_5213,"Really pretty casino and nice place to hang out.  We spent a lot of time in the food court, even if we were staying somewhere else.  They have a good sandwich place that makes a fresh panini and a ginormous gelato stand with about 40 different kinds of frozen goodness.  We also ate at the Asian fusion restaurant that was upstairs.  There was a lot of sake involved, but I think I recall the food as being tasty.  The gondola rides seem a bit like getting paddled around a mall, but it could be fun, I guess.",1
trn_5214,"We kind of liked this place, but probably won't be back unless we're shopping nearby. Unlike some other posters, we received excellent and attentive service -- walked in with no reservation just before 5 pm on Saturday and while we couldn't get patio seating, we got a nice table right away. The food was a bit inconsistent, though. The bruschetta was cold -- flavor was good, but would have tasted better hot. Hubby and I split the scallop entree and the ravioli entree -- again, the service was terrific, in that they split them both for us without us having to ask. And, the flavor, seasoning and texture of both were excellent...but the food didn't arrive hot. Desert of coconut cake was forgettable.",0
trn_5215,Great car wash! It had been an extremely long time since my car had been washed and I purchased the wheel deal. Afterwards we were using the vacuums and one of the workers came over and inspected and saw that my car was still dirty so he said to come back around again. This time he put it through the works and it's sparkling clean! Thanks wiki wiki for being great and having spectacular customer service.,1
trn_5216,"I've never had food here and I doubt that I ever would, but I've come here a couple times to get a drink. I like the ambiance and the music. It is casual, dark, but not too loud. The sound track had Nina, Billie and Tom Waits the last time I was there and I think it fits. They have a good beer selection and the prices are reasonable. Both times I've been there, including on a Saturday night, it hasn't been very crowded. The bartender knows his beers pretty well and can definitely recommend you things (though the waiters are not even close to as knowledgeable). It isn't really a scene, but a nice plus to get a decent beer with friends.",1

trn_5219,"Went twice so far. The first time I went I got the chamango and it was really good. I love mango so this drink was amazing. The second time I went and got the strawberry mojito and got to try the Cookie Monster too. The Cookie Monster is really good if you're having a sweet tooth that day. The strawberry mojito was an interesting drink because the first sip surprised me, but it grew on me with each sip. Honestly I thought it was refreshing and really enjoyed having the mango twist on it too. Again I love mango so the mango add on was totally worth it.",1

I discovered wahoos in Cali and was so stoked that there was one so close to my job. It's not exactly hiding, but it's just in a location that very easy to not notice, at least for me, but now I always see it
What I love about wahoos is the atmosphere. When I come for lunch it's a nice quiet restaurant, when I come for happy hour it's a raucous bar that happens to serve really good food. They have tons of drink specials from $2 pacificos, $6 patron and tons of nfl specials. The bartenders are always cool and good conversation even when it gets super busy
The food is well above average, as everything is build your own so you can get fish or shrimp on anything.im always there for a reef burrito and I throw fish on it. 

TL;DR
a very good environment reminiscent of SoCal with good Mexican food and cheap alcohol",1

The next day I called ahead, (good thing) only to be told that my reservation had expired (this is after he read the note that was left for them by the night crew) and I would have to make a new one, and no they didn't know if they had a mid size car and no the rate I had did not apply.

trn_5231,"I've only been here during Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 3-6pm) , I've tried a few of the Flatbreads and both the Red and White Sangria. The White Sangria tastes like white gummy bears so I was pumped about that.

The Flatbreads are $9 (during Happy Hour) which in my opinion is a little steep considering they aren't that big or that great. Even if I were starving and desperate, I'd still be a bit disappointed. 

Here's the thing, this place like most Fox Restaurants is about the decor, ambiance and providing a ""cool ""experience. Never have I ever been to a Fox Restaurant and tasted food that made me want to go back. 

It's a ""cool"" place to hang out, they also have a fun patio area but, I wouldn't recommend it for its culinary wonders or value for money.",0

We always order their guacamole and chips. The chips are made to order and arrive warm and incredibly crisp. The guacamole is fresh and the flavours are well-balanced.

I've tried a few of their tacos, but I keep coming back to the ancho-braised shortrib. Its decadent without being heavy, and the crunchy cabbage slaw makes the dish. I love how they serve their tacos on lettuce leaves. 

My boyfriend swears by their original burrito. Its served with an amazing roja sauce, guac, crema, fresh chillies and cilantro. 

Protip: some of the seats seem quite exposed to the elements. We visited once on a very cold day and had to keep our coats on the entire time. It was annoying, but we were willing to stick it out in exchange for delicious and authentic Mexican food.",1

He does magic, but he's so funny!  It's hard to explain.. he's cheesy and corny, but he owns it so well (it really is who he is), that it works for him.  You just love him!  Trust me and take the family there this summer.

The only negative I have about this show is the pacing.  It's a bit slow.. now he's very entertaining, it's just I believe a little dry in parts and could be improved by moving things along or maybe cutting 10-15 minutes in the middle.  It's a full 90 minute show, which although means you're getting a great value for the price, I think is too long for an afternoon show.",1
trn_5236,"I have been anxiously awaiting this opening and they did not disappoint! I don't think the decor could get any better, it is beautiful, and inviting. French music playing and French staff really make you feel like you're no longer in the financial district. Perfect timing as the outdoor terrace is also now open. 
Today it was pay what you wish as 100% of proceeds went to a local charity. The breads and pastries are made in house, hence the delectable smell when you walk in. 
I got a skim milk latte and croissant. I didn't know croissants could be so perfect. It was buttery but crispy and light! The latte is also perfect, it is balanced and rich, not weak. 
I do believe I have found my new favourite coffee and bakery spot. Cannot wait to try their rotational lunch menu. Je suis amoureuse!",1
trn_5237,"I've now been to the M steakhouse 3 times.  Read my previous review for more in depth details on my first visit.

First, let's tackle the food.  Every time I've gone I've gotten the filet mignon.  The taste and seasoning is good, though I think it's a tad expensive for the size.  Just up the road at Silverton you can get a steak 30% bigger for $6 cheaper.  That said, I'm happy with the size, just not the price.  The sides are all about $9 or $10 (a fair price) and range from OK to pretty good.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes are top notch and a very large serving (would be enough for 2 people if that's the only side they order).  My fiancee likes the mushrooms.  The tater tot side is not something I liked -- basically reformed breakfast hashbrown potatoes with some cheese and bacon thrown in.  Just didn't taste right to me.

Let's get to the two major failings of this place, though.  First off, the bread basket.  It's pretty dismal, to be honest.  You get 5 types of bread: harder small white bread (not toast, but think slightly stale in terms of texture), softer large white bread, some raisin/nut bread combo, and two thin wafer types which have sesame and poppy seeds, respectively.  I don't like nuts in my bread, but that's a personal preference and I'm not going to hate on them for that.  What I don't like, and I don't think anyone likes, is cold bread.  Every time I've gone I've never even gotten room temperature bread -- it's always cold.  On top of this, the butter (which has salt on it -- a nice touch), has always been ice cold and rock hard.  Who wants cold bread and hard butter?  Spending a few minutes to warm it all up would make a world of difference.

The other major failing is their service. It has been very spotty and we've only had one out of three of our experiences be good, and none of the times we've been have they been busy.  The first time we went we had Derrick as a server and he really never came to the table (read my previous review).  After that, we had Bruno and he was very good.  The last time we went, we had Florin and he was by far the worst.  I believe he had a total of 3 tables, all parties of 2, including us.  It was a while before he came over to take the order then it was about 30 minutes before we received our order.  He stated that ordering a medium-well steak would take a while to cook thoroughly, despite the fact I ordered it butterflied.  At no time while waiting for the food to come did he give us an update or check on us, instead choosing to have 5-minute long conversations with the tables next to us.  We were within 30 seconds from getting up and walking out when our order arrived.  

A while after getting our food we were low on water and asked Florin for a refill.  He then immediately went to a nearby table and struck up another 5+ minute conversation.  We only got a refill when one of the busboys noticed we were low.  Hat's off to them as every time we've been there the busboys have been very attentive.  

At the end of our meal the entire table had been cleaned and we waited for the check as Florin again was at an adjacent table having a conversation.  He saw the busboys clear the table and even met eyes with us while he continued the conversation.

Following paying the check I saw Bruno, our previous waiter, asked for his name so I could tell the manager how good our experience was with him, and then spoke to a manager.  I let him know that Florin was the absolute worst and that Bruno was amazing.

Long story short, get some decent waiters and stop serving frozen bread and butter!",-1
trn_5238,"Great place. Good home made food. I really enjoyed the Chicken Mole. 

Very nice taste. Good service. 

What I will say though is sometimes the lineups are out the door so be cautious with your time. If youre in a rush on a saturday night, dont bother.",1
trn_5239,"I'm so disappointed in this place. I recently purchased a new used vehicle that apparently had a security alarm issue. Every  time I opened the door, the damn alarm would go off. The alarm fob did not work, despite new batteries. I couldn't find a kill switch, so the only way I could turn it off was by putting the key in the ignition and turning it to the ""on"" position.

I stopped by this place after work, with new title and plate in hand, and asked how hard it would be to disable the alarm, for the time being at least, until I had more time to deal with the issue. He offered to secure my plate, then said, let us take a look.  Less than 5 minutes later, they were so sure they solved the problem by simply pulling the fuse, then wanted to charge me $40 for doing so.

When I objected since they spent less than 5 minutes on the issue, I was then lectured on how I was paying for their knowledge and expertise, when in fact all they they did was pull a fuse and fasten a license plate, (the license plate, which I did not ask them to do, they offered). He then asked how much I thought the service was worth, which I really didn't think was was worth anything, but I just slipped him a $20 just so I could be done with the deal.

As it turns out, just pulling the fuse did not work. I made two more stops after leaving, and the alarm went off again, but stopped on it's own.  Later in the evening, after getting home, I forgot something in the truck. Once again, the alarm went off.  This time though, despite inserting the key to ""on"" position, it would not turn off until I reinserted the fuse.

So ""geniuses"", I suspect you need to go back to school.  For what you did, that should have been a good faith gesture, in hopes that I would bring my vehicle back for when I needed real repairs. But since you only thought you fixed the problem and tried to gouge me in the process, trust me, I will never come back to you again.

Fortunately, I found someone who actually did fix the problem, and only charged me $20 to do so!  Put this up on your wall!!",-1
trn_5240,Had a deep cleaning last week my home took a little longer than expected and the office was in contact with me but I was fine with the additional monies as I was home most of the time and the ladies were working very diligently.  When I came home later that night my house was sparkly clean and I've had multiple follow up emails From the company.  The ladies accidentally bent an hdmi cord without realizing it but when I contacted company they immediately stepped up and offered to replace it.  Great customer service!

trn_5242,"I am a fan of Trader Joe's, always have been since I first stepped foot in one outside of Berkeley, California in my Sophomore year of college. I was instantly in love with all the products, the amazing quality - the CHEAP prices!

Trader Joe's is like your neighborhood store, except it's not Wal-Mart (YAY.) and it's l much smaller than Whole Foods, which I appreciate. I like to enjoy my shopping trips and not feel consumed by the store I am in. Often while I am at Whole Foods I feel a little uneasy because I have a hard time meandering through their multiple aisles not finding what I am looking for. TJ's is easy to navigate and set up much more like say, Albertson's or Vons. 

Their products are wide-ranging and they offer things you will not find anywhere else. For obvious example: Cookie Butter. 

I also love when they are offering samples and pop up out of nowhere to allow you to try a new delicious cookie they happen to have that day. What's better than surprise cookie? Um, not much.

Their flowers are also pretty much the best you're going to find at any super markets/grocery stores AND the prices are rock bottom. I purchased a sunflower bouquet for $3.99 as opposed to Fresh & Easy who always sell theirs at at least $5.99 but usually more like $7.99+. On my last trip I scored an entire basil leaf plant for $2.99! Yes, that's super cheap, plus the basil plant was in perfect condition.

I am going to start shopping here more often.",1

On top of being emotionally overwhelmed we were financially overwhelmed, we had to get my loved one transported to the state we lived in, Davis Funeral home offered a service that to my surprise not every funeral home has, and that was to finance our funeral bill. Instead of having to pay thousands of dollars upfront we were given the financing option through a company they work with and it gave us time to sort out the affairs. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all the staff for your kindness and compassion.",1

trn_5247,"When we first moved to Vegas, we pretty much went to every single park in the Northwest to find a good spot for our dogs to walk and play. This park looks nice, but it ends there. The lake is not kept up so it stinks. There are lots of waterfowl (ducks and geese) so their poop smells. We came once and that was two years ago.  We tried it again last weekend. We could not even stand the smell for more than 5 seconds once outside our car. It's gotten much worse! Now it smells like diarrhea and perm solution, which caused people to barf, then the barf started rotting in the sun. That's what it smells like now. No thanks!",-1
trn_5248,"I called Imagine Dental to schedule an appointment as a new client for a teeth cleaning. They scheduled me for an appointment at 3pm on the Thursday of the next week. I was called on Tuesday to confirm my appointment and was advised to arrive approximately 15 minutes early to complete new client paperwork. So far so good. I was then called at 4:15 on Wednesday and was left a message stating my appointment would need to be cancelled as it was too late, but they would be open until 5 if I wanted to call back and reschedule. Of course it was after 5 pm when I received the message. I wasn't thrilled with the level of professionalism here, and the only way I planned on using this dentist was if I could still go on the same day, I was willing to go in earlier.  I would like to mention that it is very difficult for me to get time off of work and my hours are 7:30-4, and the dental office is open from 7-4. I called back the next morning and requested an appointment for that day, just slightly earlier. They were able to fit me in at 1:30 pm. 

I get to the office and fill out all my paperwork, go through a significant amount of pictures and x-rays. The dentist spoke quite a bit about cosmetic dentistry, veneers etc and about what work I needed done on my teeth. That all took about an hour. (While I appreciate a thorough examination, I wasn't interested in any significant cosmetic work, I simply came in for a cleaning.)

I was then told I could go up to the counter and schedule my teeth cleaning. WHAT! I spoke with the women that were at the desk and expressed that I was very frustrated. First my appointment was cancelled, after they confirmed it, and now I had just spent over an hour in their office and didn't get what I came there for. I was informed at that time that they don't usually do cleanings on the first appointment, it's more of a consultation. That is all well and good, but it would have been nice to have been informed of that when I made the appointment, otherwise I would have went somewhere else. (It had been over a year since my last cleaning). They ""understand my frustration, and they try to tell everyone that calls that the cleaning doesn't happen on the first visit"" Well apparently I slipped through the cracks. Then I tried scheduling my next appointment, and lo and behold the next one that wasn't in the morning was over 3 weeks away. 

The dentist and his assistant were obviously knowledgeable, and were very friendly, but I was not satisfied with how little attention was paid to the fact that I wasn't getting the services I made the appointment for. I chose this dentist based on their location and the reviews on yelp. Bear in mind those of you who are reading this, they offer free movie tickets for reviews on Yelp and Google.",-1

As a precaution, I called for service when they opened at 7:00 a.m. They had not yet received the service calls from the night before so took the request over the phone and scheduled a tech out between 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. Pretty impressive turn around time, if you ask me.

At 8:30 a.m. Kenny shows up. He figures out the problem in about 15 minutes and said he'd need to go to the shop to get the blower wheel. The blower wheel was a bit pricey but it is a Trane unit so I went with it.

My AC was up and working by 10:20 a.m. He gave me information about how often to replace the filters and the age of the unit. I am a fan!",1

We ordered appetizers and prior to there arrival our daughter received a kids appetizer, awesome! Love it when places accommodate to families and don't fuss over them. We decided to just order a ton of Appetizers for our dinner. Our favorites were the Waygu sushi roll, lobster potstickers, spicy ahi and ribs. Paradise drink was also great. We order the braised beef on the kids menu and it was a huge serving and t was great. Thanks Roy's for catering to families and good food!!",1
trn_5253,"Walked in, it looked the same as it was the last time I was there under another business name, same colors too. Dine in seating was available although the restaurant was filled with more people who were not eating (family I guess?) than patrons during my stay. We were the only ones in a busy restaurant eating while everyone watched on.

When ordering, I advised it was my first time and the lady behind the counter took a few moments to explain the menu. Within a few seconds of that, the gentleman in the kitchen (I assume he was the owner) also asked it it was our first time and came out to explain the menu in greater detail.  He also explained the bread was made on site and the meats were fresh and of premium quality. I appreciated that and it helped me to make my choice. 

We decided on the Steak & Wiz and the Steak & Provolone. Total bill was just over $27 with 2 cans of pop and tax. The Hoagies were quite tasty and good due to the premium ingredients used. Although, the Steak & Provolone was very oily, so much that it over soaked the bun which detracted from my experience. I found that the steak was too finely shaved which made the meat taste more like ground beef than a shaved beef. Usually, It's not a problem with cheap tougher meat , but the meat here was so tender that it actually was noticeable, and I'm glad it was.

I've had quite a few ""Philly"" style Hoagies and must say OMG does a good job with their Fresh & Premium approach as well as taste. Visually, the Hoagie looked empty and doesn't match the expectation for price so that may be a detractor for me as I did expect a large stuffed Hoagie, as I find in other places, it looked measured to me.  I have yet to try the burgers and poutine so all hope is not lost. I'll be back OMG!",0

trn_5255,"I have been coming to this store faithfully since it opened maybe 15-20 years ago? In the past year or so they removed the self checkout. One employee said something about software compatibility. It doesn't really matter what the reason was. It's a giant step BACKWARDS. You can't be the only store in the country that can't handle self check out. Since then I have never gone there and not seen long lines at the so called express. I was there yesterday and the regular check out lines stretched into the aisles at one point.
I have also talked to and seen plenty of customers grumbling about it. Most will not say anything. They will just go somewhere else. I also understand that the nearby Alberston's is closing. I can only assume that things will get worse at this Safeway. I have never had an issue with the employees and feel bad for them because they are probably over-worked. 

Safeway Management/Corporate get your act together! This was a great store in a great location and I am telling you that you are losing your customers and don't seem to care from my perspective.

Their customer service is terrible; we wouldn't get updates for weeks, and would have to call him to ask for status updates. His voicemail isn't set up, so you have to keep calling, and he prefers to communicate via text which means that you're not getting the whole story when you ask for an update.

We ordered one of the specials, beef tenderloin with a yummy green sauce (not sure what it was exactly... looked like of like a mint pesto yoghurt or something) and the butter chicken with garlic naan and saffron rice. All very delicious!! The butter chicken especially, really good flavours, and the naan was baked perfectly, and the saffron in the rice was special. The service was attentive but still gave us enough space to enjoy our conversation. Who we think is the owner came over and checked on us which was unexpected but very nice, and I think that is always a good sign of someone who cares about their customers and the quality of the experience. I believe he made a point of going to all of the patrons at some point during their meal or afterwards. We will certainly be going back when we next are in the mood for Indian food!

This place is just a great place to relax, sweat, soak in Brossard.
I did the Thermal Experience as well as a massage. 

The massage room was quiet, dim, and soothing. I was a little uneasy seeing that I am usually uncomfortable with people touching me. But once my masseuse started working on my sore back from many surgeries from breast cancer, I was in heaven.

There were moments where I felt it was a little rough but all in all she was great.
From there I met my hubby for a steam, the stream room is infused with what smelled like Vicks..lol
 It did wonders for my congestion! 

From there we went to the sauna, sweat some more. When I finally couldn't take the heat anymore we head off into the freezing falls outside, which revitalized my whole body, then into the hot tub!
I hadn't felt so relaxed in months!

The air was crisp, the tubs were warm and the lighting was romantic. It wasn't to busy and the hubby and I had our own little spot in the tub.

I would certainly recommend this place to anyone. If you can't get away, take a night after work do the thermal and melt the stress away:)",1

If you are used to luxury or looking for it, this will not do. The apartment is huge and has decent things like a giant kitchen, and awesome huge SPA tub, granite, etc but the hotel itself is not really nice in my view and experience for Vegas. It's very lack luster compared to staying at Wynn or a Belagio for example and there is no up scale feeling. If you need an apartment in Vegas to cook and wash clothes and bring dogs then this place is nicer than a residence Inn but its not where I would stay otherwise. Also on the dog front, they did not have bowls, beds or a dog walk like some of the other places so I was disappointed. But the giant 1200 square foot room was appreciated by the dogs after being in the car forever. Personally, I would not stay here in Vegas unless I happen to have my dogs.",0

I got in line and waited for a long long time to get in for dinner. It was pretty expensive, ended up being between 40-50 bucks a person, but I thought the selection inside was worth it.

The food was grouped by cuisine, and there were so many things to choose from. I got stuck with the crab legs and shrimp for a while. Their sushi was passable for buffet food, and I had a sampling from each little section. Their hummus and tabouli were good, and the dessert was very yummy.

trn_5272,"Ugh. Being a student at UNCC, I rarely venture to the South Park area. For my 21st birthday all I wanted to do was eat at the infamous Cheesecake Factory. We went around 3ish so the wait was only about 5minutes. 

Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year. 

Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference? 

Cheesecake was very good though. 

I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged. I work at a restaurant and the boyfriend has a chef for a brother so we both are familiar with the service industry and I will never eat at a place with servers bold enough to readjust tips that have a manager that could care less.",-1

trn_5274,"Went here several times, usually around the time of the second performance at 8:30pm. I noticed that they added a min purchase of $10 for 90 mins during my last visit, which is expected since I bet there was people that were camping the place for hours without ordering anything.

The desserts are great, and I've taken a liking to the White Orchard. I always order at least one every time I'm there.

They also serve specials like the omurice. I haven't tried it but I should. However I noticed that they didn't put the rice into the egg omelette which is the standard way of making the dish.

For the performance, they are known as ACT102 (pronounced ACT ten two). There are three teams. 

Team A (A stands for Artistic) is my second favourite due to one of the maids (Berry) that is helping all the other maids trying to get better at English. Their schedule seems to be Tuesday and Thursday. One of the songs that is unique to them is a Morning Musume '15 song so if you are a fan of that and are good at wotagei, please do come. Keina is also in this team and I'm taken a liking for her as well. Their image colour is Blue. However, if you are cheering for Berry, support her with some purple!

Team C (C stands for Cute). I first saw them on stage during the grand opening on May 15th and I've quickly put them on the top of the list because of their performance of READY!! from The iDOLM@STER in their medley part. RIN-CHAN SAIKYOU! Also some cheers to Minnie who designed all the maid costumes for the entire cafe! Their image colour is Pink just like iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls Cute girls. Not sure what their schedule is like though.

Team T (T stands for Trouble). Their only performance so far was during the grand opening. Since I do not know much about them yet, I'm not going to talk much about them. All I know is that they performed AKB48's Heart Gata Virus. Their image colour is Yellow

They also have two planned performances at Anime North on Friday and Saturday, so if you are going there and you have time, you should give them a visit.

The atmosphere is alright, but I am hoping that there are more people around that know the chants for the songs. So far, I've been the only one there that has been doing it. Also, when they do Koi Suru Fortune Cookie from AKB48, if you don't feel shy, you should go up on stage and dance with them! The in-store music playlist that plays when no performance is going on plays some pretty popular Japanese songs as well. During my last visit, it appears they added Shine!! from iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls to this list and I was ecstatic when it came on.

I recommend this cafe for any idol fan be it 2D or 3D. The maids are also improving and I'm hoping they get more performances in. Team C is planning to do the opening theme for Hanayamata in the future.",1

trn_5276,The best hotel I stayed at in Scottsdale. Everything was on point. The staff was excellent. It was my girlfriends bday and they brought up some s'mores which they absolutely didn't have to do. I will be back.,1
trn_5277,"I recently lost my barber as a result of him moving away from Vegas and after reading some positive Yelp reviews decided to try pro-cuts at Blue Diamond and Durango. I wandered in without an appointment and was fortunate to get Ashley who was outstanding! She was friendly, amuzing, and immediately picked up on what I wanted. Ashley proceeded to give me Hawaii hook ups (where I shall be traveling soon), all the while nailing my haircut. She used a straight razor cleaned up the area around my neck expertly and provided her number to arrange convenient by text appointments. Ashley is highly recommended!",1
trn_5278,"Located in MGM hotel. Nice environment, and decent lunch price. I like the pasta, but the salmon is kind of plain, although other things in that plate are very tasty. Buttermilk sandwich is a little bit salty, waiter is nice, and they have a large selection of wines. Overall, a nice place to have lunch if you live nearby!",1
trn_5279,"I ordered a cheese steak with wiz, onions, and peppers. The add-ons costed me .75 each, even though the sign said .25. With a drink and fries, it came out to 11.50, which is on the higher end of reasonable. 
It turns out the added toppings were worth it. The peppers were juicy and crunchy, and the mushrooms were fresh. The steak itself was pretty standard fare, and I got exactly what I expected with the wiz. If you want to taste primarily cheese though, you should get extra wiz. 
The fries we well done (which I liked) and very salty (which I didn't).
The meal was 4 star, with the deduction coming from the mislabeled price",0
trn_5280,This isn't my favorite steakhouse. It was mediocre food. The service was good. The atmosphere was good. But the food was okay. We got the cold seafood platter for 2. It's a bit small for our liking. The bread was good but they just give you a giant roll of bread. It's kinda of an awkward situation. It's not cut up. They didn't give you a knife. But it's not the kind of restaurant you would use your hands at. We got the jumbo lump crab cakes and rack of lamb. The crab cakes were good but not great. The lamb was good. It was cooked good. But nothing to write home about. The most disappointing part was desert. You have to preorder it 30 minutes in event. It's literally a frozen lava cake that they heat up. I guess I would expect something homemade if it takes 30 minutes. It was gross. Tasted like it had been in the freezer for a year. It's mediocre food and a 5 star price. I wouldn't go back. There are too many great steakhouses in the area. Especially across the street.,0
trn_5281,"Had some hit and miss experiences at Roxbury.   First went here a few years back when wait at the Dorf House was too long (or it wasn't open, can't remember which), and have occasionally eaten here ever since.   Service is always good and friendly.  Atmosphere is quirky  in a good way.   Beers on tap are diverse and interesting (with some nice less common local options).   Reason why I can't give it a higher rating is because we have had some great meals here, but occasionally you will get something that is a real miss.   Menu items are a bit all over the place, so that may be the driver of the wide variance in food quality.",0
trn_5282,"I want to live here...seriously. What is better than self serve froyo? It was amazing and cheap!!!  I tried the plain (my fave), tart pineapple, pumpkin pie, and the ny cheesecake. All totally amazing.

I want one in the Seattle area ASAP!!!",1
trn_5283,"It's like a Southern Breakfast Place - without the Good Food or Charm. Very Very Average Food, Service was average (which has been consistent in the three times I visited (I thought maybe they would get their act together - no not happening) always some minor mistake. Friendly and untrained, the kind you cannot really blame the wait staff - but you can blame management. 
Just go someplace else, for the Price - food quality and wait staff, it's a disaster zone.",-1

The events coordinator, Erica, planned a perfect party, and Cory was a knowledgeable, attentive host. Our other server (who looks like the princess of Monaco) was also appreciated.  The environment is so fun- perfect for an evening dressed up or dressed down. The espresso rubbed filet and scallops were table favorites. We all had a memorable night. Clients could not believe that such a genuine gem of a restaurant was located in a hotel!",1
trn_5285,Tenant called in morning before 8 am saying she had no hot water. A couple other companies weren't even open yet. Called Spyder and James picked up right away and I received a quote within minutes and the assurance the job would get done the same day. He was extremely personable and kept me updated regarding his timeline. After the job was done he texted a photo and called to go over all he had done. He brought everything up to current code and explained all the issues the old water heater had. Based on this experience I would definitely recommend this company to others and will contact them for any future plumbing needs.,1
trn_5286,"I love Arby's. I really do. It wasn't my fav growing up but for some reason while I was deployed for a year to Iraq in 2004, I dreamed about roast beef & cheddar sandwiches constantly. When I got home, I think I ate there every day for 2 weeks - it may have been longer.

Unfortunately, I have to give this particular franchise 1 star. The service is achingly slow and they appear constantly understaffed and overwhelmed. I don't understand how because other fast food chains seem to have similar volume in the area and wait times are not 20-30 minutes of sitting in the drive-thru line.  Yes, you will waste some gas going to this location.  If you're thinking Arby's, go somewhere else.",-1
trn_5287,"Lena and I ate at this true hole-in-the-wall while on an overnight in Pittsburgh. The drinks were very cheap, and the food was honestly quite good. Apparently they are known for their wings, and they didn't disappoint! We had a split order of 10 wings that were cooked nice and crispy but not over-done. The hot sauce was my favorite, the honey mustard was also decent. The hand cut curly fries were some of the best I've had, came piping hot and delicious. We also shared a chili dog with cheese. It was a great assortment of food, the service was attentive, and all around a much better dining experience than I would have thought before walking into the place. Thanks to yelp for some good reviews. I would certainly recommend it for some decent bar bites and cheap drinks!",1
trn_5288,"Probably the most  painless car buying experience I've ever had. Woody Woo was my sales advisor at Calgary BMW. I was in and out in 10 minutes flat.

trn_5289,"My friend had been insisting we go to Cinnabon but I suggested this place. She beat me there, was halfway through a cinnamon oat scone, rice krispy treat and a coffee, and was so pleased with everything that she proclaimed all meetings will henceforth be at local coffee shops. That's a big deal for her to abandon Cinnabon!

So - Urban Beans is a cute little coffee shop. Ample seating inside, cute art on the walls that's for sale, and a really nice little patio outside. 

I had a soy white mocha and a java chip scone, and it was only $7.50  That would run $10 at the big green mermaid!  Both were really really good. 

They aren't doing made-to-order food anymore, which is what I think most bad reviews are about. The pastries are all freshly baked though.

Only thing that could be better is put some music on or something. It was deathly quiet and I felt like everyone else was listening to our conversation. We moved outside because of that.",1

I've had many facials but she by far exceeded my expectations, I unfortunately had to switch from hydrafacial to express due to pregnancy and spa rules about the LED lights or something but Nicky totally made up for it by listening to all my concerns and using specific products based on exactly what I complained of or needed to help improve my skin. It's rare to find someone so informed and enthusiastic but she is both! Thanks so much Nicky! And I'm loving the Lancer Method Polish and instalift so I'm sure I'll be back soon to buy the rest of the products you recommended!",1
trn_5296,"I've been here twice, and both times I've had a great, juicy burger and awesome fries.  There's a good selection of toppings, and beers that you can't find everywhere else, so that's a nice touch as well.  The service is always fast and pleasant, and I leave feeling soooooooo full.  My American boyfriend who claims he couldn't get a good burger in Toronto actually loves the burgers here, that's how good it is!",1
trn_5297,"Much better than the store on spring mountain, this store could be twice the size of the old one.  Its new and clean and they have a huge selection.  

However, I think savers is getting a bit out of hand with its pricing, I don't think used shoes should be priced at $14.99 or used pants being priced at $12.99.  Its also nearly impossible to find stuff on sale.  

Also, was shopping on a wednesday afternoon and every fitting room was full and there were about 8 people waiting to try stuff on. With all that space they could've built some extra fitting rooms.",0

Lang Van is the best!  Service is awesome.  Staff is beyond friendly and if you dont know what you want just tell them what you like and they will tell you what dish.  It is awesome.  My mom went with her book club and they had no clue what to get.  The staff brought them an appetizer, then brought them three entrees to share.  They all loved it.

trn_5300,"After reading some of the reviews about this place I was hesitant to stop in, but I'm happy I did. I can understand how some of the other reviewers could see how the owner could come across as a little brash, but he is just very straightforward. 

The biggest thing that surprised me about this place were the prices. I've searched everywhere and this place beats the prices of everyone hands down. He was even willing to order me a model he didn't have on hand at a discount. Eventually I settled on a much better model for only $50 more than the one I went in to buy. Overall it was the best experience I could have asked for and I really appreciated the transparent and direct manner that the owner handles business. I'll be going back for all my needs in the future for sure!",1
trn_5301,"My wife and I were looking for somewhere new to eat but more specifically Ramen. All the popular spots were busy so we searched a little more and found this little gem.

More to the point though the food was as good as the service and the prices are reasonable.

We will definitely be coming back with friends and family.",1

trn_5303,"The food was good. Tater tots were very good and the oysters were great. The reason for the 2 stars is the service. I waited over 45 minutes for 6 oysters. The waitress that we had checked on us once after the initial ordering. I saw multiple tables receive their oysters that were seated after us. Eventually the manager brought us our oysters, with the waitress finally coming back over and saying ""wow the oysters are coming out slow"". If you screwed up and didn't enter the order, just tell me. Don't try to BS your manager in front of me like I'm an idiot. Honestly I rarely complain about service at restaurants but this was awful. I had to ask both the hostess and the manager to get our waitress. Even upon the manager finding out what had happened, nothing was done about it. Truly atrocious service.",-1
trn_5304,"What a wonderful meal.  I had a fish stew that had scallops, shrimp, and talapia.  Who would have thought of going to Arizona for great seafood?  Lon's is a really fun and interesting restaurant right in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  We toured the grounds and the wine cellar and had a wonderful time.  I'll go back.",1
trn_5305,"Came in here with a large group of friends both guys and girls, and they were able to accommodate us all perfectly. The girl at the front desk along with the whole staff gave excellent service, made us feel comfortable and not snobby like other clubs we've been too. The dancers were all super cool and super friendly, not over bearing so that was even better! Our cocktail waitress Rhia was awesome and very attentive, as we where a big group she took great care of us all well. Oh and the best part? LOCALS GET HALF OFF!! We were all happy about that. Music was good. All in all we had a great time and really enjoyed our selves here. This club definitely deserves more recognition!! Not like all those other played out strip clubs.",1
trn_5306,"Salsa had no heat, not even the hot one.   food was flavorless and over cooked.   Service was horrendous.   Nothing to say good things about.   Vegetable fajita had no seasoning and tasted canned and greasy.   Fish fajitas also lacked seasoning and fish was cut into small pieces and treated as though thawed.   Guacamole tasted store bought.  Would not recommend",-1
trn_5307,"I loooove carbs. I probably am on an all carb diet. Vegetables are technically carbs so don't judge me too harshly. Why do carbs have such a bad rep? Those carbohydrate hating people need to come to Sidewalk Citizen and try their sourdough. It is so amazing I'm sure I could eat an entire loaf by myself. 

I had the vegetarian sandwich they were offering that day and they will warm it up for you if you want. The sandwich was pretty good but not mind blowing. The sandwich is a little expensive at $11 but it was quite large. Their sourdough loaves are definitely the highlight of this little shop. There is also a selection of other food in the rest of the store but I pretty much just hone in on the bread.

You get a small 5% discount if you have a friends of CJSW card. It's not much, but it adds up if you plan on coming here as often as I do!",1

My only complaint was with the sound levels in Theater 3 which made it difficult to view some films.",1
trn_5309,"While shopping inside the store one staff member clearly making fun of men and African American men at that, I observed along with my wife making monkey noises and huffin around like she thought males do. As the only male and African American inside the store of three customers my wife and daughter, she did it in front of all the other staff whom seemed to enjoy it, as they all clearly saw me watching her and then alerted her that I was watching her. The woman at the desk by the waiting room was rude and very unprofessional along with all the other staff whom seemed to enjoy her antics. As I know what looks like a duck is a duck and I'm not an over reactor its clear that these women all 5 of them need either a retraining on how to cary themselves in public and around customers, and wait until customers leave the store to make or poke fun at males or African Americans or they need to be fired. 

I know you think your privileged and work in a high price area, but best believe and let me say this as clearly as I can as I tend to be too obtuse. You all knew better and with a mixed child who thinks women like you are friendly, she was shown by your actions that your not. If you can't show customers respect because you lack professional integrity and think we don't have money because of our race. We can spend our money else where and not only that we can write review's to ensure it changes. Now as I have all your names this review isn't the last you'll hear from me its the first. Clean up your act no matter the customer in the store as my wife made it clear that she along with myself didn't appreciate the office bully tatics and unprofessional ways in which you all carried yourselves. The joke if that what it was, wasn't more important then our service and could have been told later after we or anyother customers left. Ya feel me dawg as the woman walked around the store acting out and to me. Not funny and you defently aren't an actor either.",-1
trn_5310,"Best cannolis in Toronto! This is our go-to dessert spot if we're anywhere in the West End, especially if we want to stay out late but not drink. 

They also do espresso poured over ice cream like no other. 

If you're there in the summer, hit up the patio. It's huge and great for people-watching. 

The only down side is that you sometimes have to wave your arms to get the attention of the waiter/waitress. It's relatively minor, in my opinion, since this is the kind of place you go to have a leisurely end-of-night. And the staff there are very friendly, they're just usually really busy. 

Can't wait to go again!",1
trn_5311,"Grossly underwhelmed with my visit to Bluebird this morning. I've been hearing so many great things about it, and just had to try it. I was met with fairly rude service, and when I tried to order breakfast I was told that they had stopped serving breakfast. So I tried to order lunch, but was told they weren't serving lunch. So my pickings were pretty slim. I had a slice of the Quiche and the small Sweet Potato Hash. The hash was quite flavorful, however the ""small"" size is more like a spoonful (plus it was lukewarm). The quiche was ok, but it tasted pretty watery and lacked a lot of flavor you'd expect to taste in a Quiche. 

I love the concept of this restaurant, I just had a bad experience. It seems silly to me to drop $9 on a pretty mediocre (and SMALL) breakfast. I'll be back to try lunch sometime, I'm just not in a huge hurry.",-1
trn_5312,"Stopped by on this little and quaint coffee shop on our way from Charlotte to Greenville, SC based on their outstanding Yelp reviews and rating. We were not disappointed.

The proprietor was very friendly, service was quick, prices were fair and both our coffee drinks (which were a creative and expansive offering) and their baked goods hit the spot. Their blueberry muffin was packed with fruit while their cinnamon roll was deliciously sticky. 

The decor is fun, relaxed, somewhere between reading room and relaxing lounge, with an assortment of local artist items for sale and a large bookshelf full of free books for the reading.

A pleasant gem that I highly recommend if you are in this quaint little town and need a jolt of caffeine and a small bite to eat.",1

trn_5316,We had a very bad experience with our recent visit to the restaurant. 1st of all there is no sign in directing us where we should go to find the restaurant in Caesars palace - it literally took us more than 30 mins to find the restaurant. The ambiance was nice. Food is average and definitely not 5 stars quality. Our martini's came out room temperature despite we asked that to be very cold (which it supposed to be).  At the end when the bill came we all chipped in our credit cards and the waitress bought our card back and all individual card amount was much more than the original bill - there were 3 baileys and one cheesecake added to the bill ($125).  We questioned the bill and waited for close to an hour for them to fix it. They gave us a break on our drinks. Very very bad experience- definitely ruin mr chows reputation!,-1
trn_5317,"The worst Thai Express I've tasted in Canada. And the worst chicken noodle soup I've tasted in my life. Absolutely no taste at all. And the girl at the cashier has terrible attitude. No expression on her face. No willing to open her mouth to talk to customers. It seems that the whole world owes her something. When I asked her for a soup spoon for my noodle soup, she's like I owe her big! And I had to leave the noodle soup with just one sip because it tastes so bad. And no vegetable leaves at all.",-1
trn_5318,"I went to Pita Jungle for the first time on Saturday Feb. 1st. I had heard some really great things about Pita Jungle and was excited to try it out. I grossly underestimated the popularity of the place though and when I walked up I was surprised to see just how busy the place was. I was with a friend and we were told that a party of 2 had a wait of about 15 minutes. I found the hostess to be a bit short, she was clearly overwhelmed but honestly, that should not affect how she treats people. When we were finally seated I found myself wishing we had sat outside, I felt as though I was sitting on top of the people to my right and left. I felt as though I was intruding on other's meals. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu which I found to be incredibly helpful being that this was my first time. I order the Mediterranean Chicken Pita and was very impressed. It was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor. My biggest complaint about the whole trip was the wait time to receive our check. We were on a schedule and it took forever for us to receive our check and had to flag someone down to take our payment. I will definitely be returning but I plan on going during a time when it is not as busy and I can enjoy myself a bit more",0

I had every intention of making some big purchases and was looking forward to receiving some help. We looked around the store for nearly 20 minutes and though it was not busy at all we weren't recognized or greeted by any employee.  I was shocked. This isn't the service I've come to expect from West Elm.  The store was immaculate and everything so well displayed.  But the service was beyond lacking.  I left without purchasing anything.",-1
trn_5321,"The rooms are amazing IF you get one above the 10th floor. Our initial room was on the 5th floor and the windows opened up onto a BRICK WALL. You have to pay extra to get the view. On site it is cheaper to upgrade, only $49/day. We upgraded to the 10th floor. 

We asked the front desk to remove the feathers (make the room hypoallergenic.) When the maids took out the pillows and comforter, they shook feathers all over the room. I still had problems the whole time, unfortunately.

Apparently, this is a VERY common request. They did not have enough blankets because everyone else wants hypoallergenic rooms.  This was problematic. I had two sons with me. One was 9 months old. They had RUN OUT of cribs even though we had reserved one, called ahead one week and also called that morning. So, they told us they could give us ONE BLANKET to replace the comforter for the bed. What would my two sons sleep with? So they allowed us to have ONE MORE blanket for my son on the couch. 

My 9months old baby slept on the FLOOR in the BATHROOM on TOWELS. 

They brought me a crib the next day. I asked for it at 7:00 a.m., I am sure this was the only reason I was able to get one. I also asked for another blanket at this time. I was still sleeping under the robes provided because I was too cold. (My husband and I have different temperature tolerance. Normally, I just use a blanket, but since I could not obtain more than one, we had a problem.)

They gave me a nice baby package (shampoo, powder, etc.) for the baby at this time with a small baby blanket. Why didn't they give me that the day before?

What was very nice was that on level 2 was the shopping with the beautiful canals. We really enjoyed that. Also on the first floor was the breakfast buffet. We could go there while my husband napped.

Why not have some hypoallergenic rooms already set up? Why not buy some hypoallergenic comforters so people with allergies do not have to freeze to death at night? One would think for a property of this caliber that we would not have service telling us how many blankets we can and cannot have. We did not feel like we were at a first class property.",-1
trn_5322,"This used to be one of our favorite places for Lenten fish fry.  I don't know what changed from last year but, tonight we had the greasiest three pieces of breaded cod.  I ate one piece, removed the breading on the second piece and left most of my french fries uneaten because they were soaked with oil from the fish. My wife left two pieces of fish and most of her chips uneaten for the same reason!  To top it all off, there were half a dozen guys playing a ""chipping game for beer"", who were way too loud, occasionally profane and just plan rude!

Unlike many dental offices, if you don't have insurance you are offered reduced prices which is comforting when you don't have much money. The dental office staff is top notch in the customer service department-very friendly. The rooms are clean, which leads you to believe they keep up with cleaning the equipment too. Overall, I have no problem referring him to others. If you have to go to the dentist, you might as well go to one you can be completely comfortable with.",1

The one thing that gets my goat is paying for carts, I know it's minimal, but I never have change. How many suckas are stealing carts? Ridiculous.

I mean don't get me wrong it was decent food but not a place I am able to rave about or even a place that I would try a second time. I had the chicken shawarma bowl. The chicken tasted pretty good but was overshadowed by way too much lettuce and my bowl was filled with a lot of the bitter pieces. Overall, not a bad place to go but I've definitely had better",0

trn_5339,"Great burger. Lives up to its hype with the succulent double-double cheeseburger. This was my second time at an In-N-Out and I was not disappointed. The burger is juicy, consisted, and feels of quality despite this being categorized as fast-food. One thing is I tried to like the 'animal style' fries (ordered it two times now), but it is not good and a bit overrated. The price of the animal fries are about the same as a double-double and does not satisfy me. The dressing makes it soggy and sticky and I generally prefer the regular cut fries to be able to add to my burger or add on ketchup to it. Ordering the animal fries also added an additional 12-15 minute of wait for me which was a bit annoying. 

In-N-Out is great and hope it makes it out to the Midwest in the future!",1

trn_5344,"Cha Me Cha is A-OK!
It was odd when my friend set up a get together here in cold weather for Snow Ice... but whatever... I'll trek from downtown just to hang out with some friends for the evening.
The place is a decent size and their food is good. Long line up on a Saturday evening, a little more than an hour wait, but good thing we can walk around T&T to pass the time.

Savoury:
Fried (popcorn) Chicken
Squid balls
I really liked the savoury food we ordered. They were seasoned very well, not overly loaded (like the ones at Destiny... but sometimes we crave for that msg).

Dessert:
Sweet Custard Brick Toast - pretty good but I'll stick to the simpler condensed milk toast
Cotton Snow Ice - it may be that it's too cold out or it was a bit over hyped or I just came back from my SF trip that had awesome desserts. I wasn't so impressed with the flavor. The texture was unique and hard to explain... Like water turned into ice cream, it's topped with popping boba and mini mocha for flavor and you can drizzle condensed milk.

Bubble Tea:
Guava Orange with frubo (popping boba)
House Milk tea
Brown sugar with cereal milk tea
They were okay nothing super special.

I was very impressive that they don't rush you out the door. Service was pretty good, fast and friendly. Price is decent, we paid $55 including tip.

I would go back to Cha Me Cha if I'm in the area during the summer. But I wouldn't trek all the way from downtown for it or wait in a long line up.

trn_5345,"Let me start out by saying I love Chili's.  That being said, I had an awful experience at this particular location.  First, there was a drunk guy wandering around causing a scene in there and it took a while for anyone to ask him to leave.  Mind you this was at 11:30 AM.  This would not have ruined my experience, because I know stuff happens.  Then the waiter walks up and calls us kids... I'm almost 30.  Then the real kicker was when the food finally came and my rice still had the bag on it that they re-heat it in.  This grossed me out.  I do not want to know what sort of pre-packaging my food comes in.  Then when I told the waiter, it sort of seemed like this happens all the time.  So either way, I've been back there, but not happily.",-1

I did the Tinga Poblana and although I ended up being allergic to the peppers, it was so good that I would get it again and just take 4 Benadryl. My husband rocked out a taco and some other stuff and said it was amazing. I would compare it to actual Mexican food instead of the crap that has been overly Americanized. 

Also, of you're looking to get your drunk on for cheap, get a half-pitcher of margarita for $10 and don't share. Be sure to call a cab.",1
trn_5348,"BEAUTIFUL facility, very clean. Staff was incredibly courteous and kind. Veterinarians and nurses are very passionate about quality animal care. Visits are about $12 more expensive than other animal hospitals, but the few extra dollars is definitely worth it because the vets are very thorough. The vets are also very conscious of the money involved with animal care and will present different treatment options with prices depending on what works for you. I really appreciated their concern for my pet and my wallet. Very impressive!",1
trn_5349,"Excellent buffet, even if they just give coke products :)  Yummy kobe beef, beef wellington & mashed potatoes were awesome.  Loved the assortment of sharp cheeses.  Our waiter was awesome and spot on.  Not one complaint about the food.  I was too full to have dessert.",1

Des was our waitress and she was attentive and kind.  Amongst the group, we shared chips, guac, salsa, wings, some quesadillas, some tacos, and of course... more than a few margaritas!

Crab rangoons were disgusting, I couldn't even eat them and the chicken and broccoli was weird tasting, the gravy was really thick and the rice wasn't the best i've ever had.

trn_5354,"Was told this place was the best Italian in Henderson by mt step-daughter so though the wife and I would try it out last Friday night.

Overall impression was it's a cozy little place with great decor, decent appetizers (we had the sampler with calamari, cheese sticks and fried ravioli), and it was pretty good.

I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and the wife ordered the Chicken Parm.

Thumbs up on the Chicken Parm

Thumbs down on the Alfredo.... Fettuccini noodles were cooked probably 2-3 minutes under cooked so they were very, very chewy. I had to put quite a bit of tooth to them to get them chewed up. I probably only 3 bites and left the rest.

As the waiter came by at the end of the meal to collect our plates and ask if we needed 2 boxes to take the rest home, I said I didn't need one due to the undercooked noodles. The server/hostess was apologetic but neglected to even offer us a refund or take any price off the final bill.

Don't think we'll be back to this place, even though it's close to home.

I always see in the reviews and some would say "" I don't even understand why people bring their kids"" . Hello !! People this city is not only for adults but this is also great for kids . Of course the parents will not enjoy their vacation if they leave their kids at home . How can u enjoy it?

Now not all people are gambler . Even if I don't gamble I still enjoy Vegas , there's so many things to do here aside from clubbing or dining , I make it a point to see a show each night that I'm here to complete my day.

The carpet has stains, and the furniture is tore up. The whole room smells bad. It was so bad, that by 7:30 that same morning we left to go stay in another hotel. But that is not all.

Not pleasant at all. Then we received our $9 beers which were warm.
Half of us ordered the lobster bisque because I had it before and thought it was so good, one of their best dishes. We received them and it was watery, very very fishy and just not at all what I have had on previous nights there. We had to send it back it was that bad, I never send food back.
Finally when we all received our entrees, I had ordered the ""jumbo"" scallops. I received what they call jumbo but in actuality was bay scallops somewhere between small and medium size. My mashed potatoes that I received with my meal where like they had been sitting under the heating lamp too long and formed a hard shell over them. The broccoli was bland with no seasoning or butter for taste.
Not one person in my party had a good meal that they would say was worth the price.

While the outdoor area is very nice it did not make up for the meal that was served. I will never be going back to this place. 
I recommend if you are looking for a nice fish dinner to spend the extra cash and go to Monterrey bay or off the hook  in warrendale. 
You would probably get a better meal at Red Lobster at least they are pretty consistent with the food.",-1
trn_5400,"Food was just adequate. We all had Reuben's that were just ""okay"".  Nothing special! The Pepsi was flat and did not taste good either. The place is supposed to be smoke free but there were people smoking in the doorway. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he said was a bit dry. Had no flavor.",-1
trn_5401,"Friend made me go 30 minutes out of the way to eat here, which I didn't really didn't feel like doing. I not only would have went 30 minutes , but probably an hour to have their amazing sandwich. Everything was soooo tasty.  We had their roast beef, pastrami and salami with some spreads that the worker said we would like. He was right. One of the best , if not the best sandwiches I ever eaten.  Amazing!!",1
trn_5402,"This place is so delicious. No joke. I cannot believe I'm saying this about a restaurant that is basically a gas station, but I am. The food is bomb. They have a pretty large selection and my food, as well as my friend's, was excellent. It's totally worth potentially being seen eating here. No, seriously, it is.",1
trn_5403,This place is cute. Has a patio that dogs are allowed.  The food is delicious. But once you get the original chop salad...its hard to get anything else.  The creamy pesto dressing is one to crave! Yummyyyyy,1
trn_5404,Wow...pricey but totally worth it.  I tried their bloody mary which was recommended by the waitress and it did not disappoint.   I also ordered the chicken and waffles. Could have done without the spiced watermelon and left the spices off.  I think was cayanne pepper. Overall lots of food for two to share. Delish deep fried chicken and a wealthy amount. Waffles are waffles...,1
trn_5405,"I came here for 'licious dinner last Friday and was less than impressed with the food and the service. To me, it was pretty clear that Osteria is a new restaurant and they are still trying to get their footing as there were many lags during the meal and the servers were mixed up with which table ordered what. 
Both my friend and I got the scallops to start which were soggy. The sauce was good though, very buttery. I think the server gave us someone else's order as it came out really quickly and then shortly after we finished it the same server came to give us another serving of them! 

I got the steak medium rare - it was more medium as it was very thin (you get what you pay for, right). The veggies it came with were good though... you can tell they were a bit caramelized. My friend got the penne. Her penne was nothing special and the pasta was underdone and a bit hard to chew. I really could have made better penne at home. 

Lastly, our dessert took over half an hour to get to us. We had to ask after we noticed it was nearly 20 mins and the sun had already set - it got pretty cold. We did get an apology from the server but no realty explanation as to why it was late besides ""I put it in the system but it somehow got missed"". 

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here as there are better restaurants in the area, although admittedly, the pizza did look very good (I was peeking at other tables lol). The patio was a little awkward as it was on an obvious slant so I was sitting lower than my friend and there was lots of movement of different tables around me to accommodate changing party sizes.",-1
trn_5406,"This store is humongous!! It has a wide variety of hunting and fishing gear, accessories, and more! In addition, they have activities such as archery and a gun range inside! Please open up a store in Hawaii! Most of the things we purchased, we would have to purchase online back in Hawaii. My husband went crazy in this store haha. The parking lot was super interesting. Instead of lines, there were fishes.",1
trn_5407,"2 weeks ago, I went to have my legs waxed at Aroma. I had gotten a great Brazilian done by Margo a month earlier, and this time I chose a woman named Liz for a full leg wax. The experience itself was quick, and relatively painless, aside from some issues. This waxing experience has left me with large burn patches on my legs in several areas, including the inside of my knees, my inner thigh, and my upper buttocks. 

Firstly, the waxer was too caught up in talking to me, and I could see she was no longer as focused while applying the hot wax as the session went on. As I was sitting under fluorescent lights, I watched her mindlessly remove hair from sensitive areas (my knees, back of my knees, my inner thighs), and probably the most shocking, apply wax on these areas AGAIN. I did make a comment about being careful where my skin is softer, but isn't this common sense to a professional waxer? Why is a waxer applying more wax to areas that have thinner, barely-there hair? Before the session was over, these areas were shiny and stinging, and when she left to get a ""special cream"" for these areas, I knew that she had overdone it, instead writing them off as minor patches of sensitive skin. I should add that I can now see that most of my leg hair was not even removed from the roots, and my legs felt prickly the next week as if I had shaved them. I essentially got an uncomfortable shave for my lower legs.

To add insult to injury, I also had my upper lip waxed, and when I went downstairs (after being kicked out of my room because we had gone overtime for no reasons of my own), I asked the woman sitting at the front desk if I could have some cream to put on my upper lip. She was so incredibly rude and condescending, I had to chalk it up to her nature, rather than a personal slight. I'm sorry, is this how your receptionists are trained to deal with customers? I only wish I had asked her name, so I could have called the manager the next day. She has dark hair with bangs, and is maybe of Spanish or Asian descent. 

Honestly, I was not even going to write a review. Liz was a very nice waxer, and I almost felt like me engaging in conversation with her made it my fault. However, me engaging with my waxer shouldn't mean I walk away with my legs scarred. People around me have been asking about the patches on my legs, and are shocked to find out that this was the work of a waxer. 2 weeks later, after putting Polysporin and Vitamin E on my legs everyday, the marks are still very obvious, but no longer painful. 

I have not yet decided if I will return to Aroma. Perhaps only to see Margo for my Brazillians. I can definitely say that the extra 15% off waxing on Tuesdays and Wednesdays is not enough to deal with some of the girls sitting at the reception desk.",-1

trn_5411,"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.

I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)

So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:

There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???

The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.

If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.

Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.

Not going back.",-1
trn_5412,"Figured train was the best way to reach, I was right.

trn_5414,"I had very strange experience at Old Sugar Distillery.  I think everyone would agree that a good product can take you far...but quality service is what gets you all the way.
My chai hot toddy was delicious...the pumpkin martini really wasn't but I think others might enjoy it, I'm just a wuss and found it too strong.  

I went to the bar and ordered a flight, chai hot toddy, pumpkin martini and cheese/meat plate.  I was told that the cheese/meat plate would take about 10 minutes and I said no worries and showed the bartender where I was sitting.  My pumpkin martini and flight came right up while waiting at the bar....and then I waited about 10 minutes for the hot toddy before saying something.  The bar tender apologized and then made it for me.  No big deal, it happens....however....

After sitting down and having our drinks 30 minutes passed.  My husband went over to the bar to say we hadn't received the food and came back to sit down....then the woman who said that I would have to wait 10 minutes for the meat and cheese plate came and just plain said she didn't think she could make it.  Umm...ok.   Then she sheepishly asked if I would mind just having cheese.  (this is really annoying because they advertise on the menu that the sausage is made in the f-ing building...why couldn't just go get it next door?)  I said ""no, obviously not because I paid for the entire dish.""  She responded with ""ohhh, you paid for it already? Do you mind coming to find me in 10 or 15 minutes, we're really busy.""  I was pretty annoyed at that point and said ""no, I'm not going to go and find you so either bring the food or give me my money back.""  She brought the meat and cheese plate a few minutes later. 

WEIRD right???  I won't be back.",-1

trn_5418,"Typical McDonald's, located in the food court at the MGM Grand.  

Prices are reasonable and no higher than any free standing location and they are open 24 hours.

Cashiers are reasonably friendly, considering what they have to deal with most times (crazy, out of control drunk people).  They offer an employee discount the MGM employees - it's not a lot, but it's better than nothing.

The only thing of note is that breakfast is not available 24 hours (like most McDonald's locations) - but starts at 4am.

It always seems like the food is ready quicker than anywhere else I've been.  Not sure if that is good or bad!

Basically, if you are too cheap to dine at the other late night option (Wolfgang Puck's), this is a good choice.  Especially if you are just getting back from the club.",0

trn_5420,First of all my delivery driver was rude. He claims he called me but after showing him my call log he shut up. My onion rings came cold and mushy. My pizza was also burnt. Never ordering pizza from here again. What a waste of $40 bucks.,-1
trn_5421,I have been eating at this place now for about 5 years. I love how they created more  room since before it was too small and crowded. The lunch time rush is not for those in a hurry. You can expect to wait after you place your order on a weekday about 15-30 minutes before  you leave if you are doing a take-out order. The place does get packed but the hot and cold sandwiches that I have tried are awesome and full of flavor. The pasta salad is ok but nothing to write home about. If you are not in a hurry and can wait up to 30 mins for your to go order it is worth a try. If not stop by after 2pm when the lunch rush has already passed through.,0

This will not be one I return too.  My steak was cooked exactly the way I asked and was quite tasty.  The calamari and shrimp appetizer was also very good.  Nothing really wowed my taste buds and coupled with the service we won't be going back.  My BF had the scallops.   They were good but the Daily Grills are much better and less expensive.

We asked him to come see what we were unhappy about and he refused and rolled his eyes! The following day we requested a late courtesy check out and he replied ""we normally allow it but in your case Im sorry we won't be able to accommodate you""  He was actually holding a grudge with us for wanting a clean room!!! To top it all off they double charged us for the room!  When we called later to be refunded they told us they had no way of refunding us!  We had to have our bank reject it.  The front desk staff and management was just simply rude and unsympathetic.   We will use other Quality Inns but NEVER THIS ONE AGAIN!",-1

trn_5438,"Rented through Southwest Vacations for a quick weekend getaway to Scottsdale.  The actual check in process wasn't very bad.  Came right up to the counter and was helped right away. Wasn't pressured to upgrade anything but was talked into pre purchasing gas at a cheaper price than in town.   The gentleman explained that the $28 charge was an estimate and I'll be credited with the return of the Kia Rio we have rented.   Should've prob read the YELP reviews first . I'm hoping for the best when I return the car in 2 days.  Didn't like that when I said the boyfriend would also be driving, they charged an extra $10/per day but once I noticed this, I had him take both the driver and the charge off.  No problem. I thought this should've been made aware to me right away.  
Biggest problem was going to actually get the car.   You leave the check in area and go downstairs into the garage.  No biggee!!   Upon coming up to the Payless counter, the counter girl, I believe her name was Geraldine (?), was sitting with a boy from one of the other companies with ear buds in their ears and it took her a minute to even acknowledge us.  No ""hello"", ""good evening"", or anything.  Rude!!!   She gave us out key and told us which space.  I was to go to the car and check for damage. When I came back to tell her about the damage, including what looked like the bumper had been side swiped, she once again had the ear buds in and looked horribly irritated when I arrived.  She ripped out the ear bud and that was it, irritated myself, I asked ""am I putting you out or something?""  She didn't say anything.    You are in the customer service business, act like it!!!  When I reported the damage, she circled all the areas of the car and said it'll all be fine!   Then when I mentioned that the one side actually looks like it was side swiped another employee piped in and said ""it's from the luggage, you won't be charged for that"".  Ugh, no it's not but I wasn't about to get into a pissing match.  
I'm hoping the return experience will be better and the employee who helps me next time will actually care about their job and not music on their phone!!
UPDATE:  car was returned with no problem and no refund for 1/2 tank of gas.  Gentleman said if we want we can go to a gas station and fill it up. Boooo!  Felt like I was taken.    Note to self: make sure to read Yelp reviews ;).",-1

Even tho my nails would always break they looked great, so I continued to see him. I went in to get a fill with gel polish & he painted on a really thick layer of the gel polish, after the last coat you could tell the polish was dry on top but not underneath. He had me put my nails under the UV light for almost 15 mins straight. After that he attempted to drill off the polish & start over. After about 20 mins he gave up and had one of his coworkers finish while he went to the store to go shopping. Half an hour later this lady finally got the gel off & she painted my nails with one hand with a white base coat & the other without & you could clearly see the difference in color. After almost 3 hours my nails looked sooo bad, my hands were darker than my arms & damn near burning.

The customer left and they picked one of the items up and said ""she didn't wear this? Yeah, right."" I was changing in the dressing room and they were complaining about a customer who asked about their policy in bringing items in and they didn't seem to understand it.

If you want a kick but not have your tteokbokki uncomfortably hot and spicy, order it with the Rose base sauce. The place is well lit with a nice modern vibe, and the staff were nice, accommodating and friendly. The tteokbokki itself was nice and chewy, just how it should be. The portions are big, so come hungry! I wasn't totally prepared so unfortunately, I couldn't fully finish mine.

He showed me how much dirt I have in the vent and asked me to check the result after cleaning the dryer filter for free. He tested the air pressure again and again to make sure the hose is working as expected. He spent 2-3 hours in the work. I believe what he cares most is the quality of the work he provided.

trn_5454,"I have been going to the O'Reilly auto parts store for over 5 years now on 9809 West Happy Valley Road Peoria, AZ 85383. Last night at 7:30 pm (5/6/13) my battery died yet again in my car. I purchased it from O'Reilly about 3 years ago an had it replaced about 14 months ago with a new battery from O'Reilly's. I took it out of my car and brought it in, expecting to have a quick check on the battery and replaced like it's always been.   To my dismay the employee said he needed to attempt to charge the faulty battery for 30 minutes while I waited in the store. I complained that this was never done ever in the past and he stated this is always how it was done.   Since the employee did not value my time over his, I was forced to wait while they attempted to charge my faulty battery. After 30 minutes he checked the battery again...and determined it was indeed faulty. He grabbed a new battery from the shelve and informed me it would be $55... I complained that the last battery did not last the 24 months and it was under replacement.   The employee informed me that the warranty was from the original date of purchase and prorated afterward. After explaining that he wasted over a half of hour of my time and other retailers such as Costco allow the warranty period to restart when you get a new replacement...he didn't seem to care. He actually told me, ""well you should of bought it at Costco then"".   At that point I took my old battery back and left the store. For a company that prides itself on customer service...I could not of been found at that store that night. I ended up purchasing a new battery at Costco. Even though it cost me more upfront, I consider it a learning experience. The employee's at that branch were not interested in service, only sales.   If truly this is the way the treat long time customers, I will find another parts supplier that treats there customers with the respect they deserve.",-1

trn_5457,"I normally don't review a fast food joint simply because, well, let's face it, it's a fast food joint. But after driving all the way out here to get a fat juicy burger and some yummy delicious fries and being shorted, I felt I had to say something.
1. Slow service. About ten to twelve minutes for an order for 2. Mind you, nobody else was dining in. I did however hear the employee behind the counter yell out that he had a 6 minute wait time on drive through. 

2. A handful of fries. This was the same amount of fries for a small/regular order, and a medium order. Both orders had the same small handful of fries. 

3. No help. Seriously? I saw three people working there the entire time. And I use the term ""working"" lightly. One gentleman behind the counter was running around doing what the other two fell short on. 

The food itself was well prepared and tasted great. Hence the 2 stars, but the service itself could use some improvement. Possibly one more set of hands or a properly trained and motivated staff would help greatly.",-1

So I read that this place can get pretty crowded( it does, some people came today but ended up leaving because of the wait time) so I went ahead and placed a table reservation , luckily when we got there a table was ready for us so yay! 
Our server was great, he knew a lot about what they actually serve.
I got Matt's Omelette and let me tell you this, it was everything I look for in an omelette ! The flavor hit the spot definitely ! And I also tried their blueberry pancake, and that thing was packed with blueberries, good fluffy pancake and not too sweet.
Overall this place is a great breakfast/brunch spot , one thing I can suggest though, is we need more ""SMILES"" in this place :)",1

I filed a warranty claim today and I hope they do the right thing, however, I am not optimistic after reading all these reviews.",-1
trn_5463,"Absolutely horrible! The food is mediocre at best but way overpriced. The management was horrible. Had to wait after checking in with our reservation. Then the waiter was rude and awful. Messed up our order then brought a rushed replacement to only have a second one come 5 minutes later with the actual presentation and plating that it was meant to have. How insulting! After complaining to one manager and getting blown off we had to wait 20 minutes to talk to the general manager who then argued with us about why the poorly plated version was delivered. The entire evening was so disappointing and insulting we will most definitely never go back nor recommend it to anyone. Take your money elsewhere you'll be glad you did!

as far as the food goes, it was less than amazing. The cod had half a piece of bok choy and a tiny piece of pineapple the sauce had hardly any flavor. The scallops were small and nothing amazing. The steak tartar was fine though it would have been nice to know they came with french fries so we didn't order mashed potatoes as well. The alaskan king crab was fine, but overall none of the food was worth what they were asking.",-1

trn_5468,"Expecting a smooth ride after paying close to $1000 for new tires, mounting, balancing, alignment, etc is too much of an expectation, I guess. After the first day of having my new tires I had to bring my car back in because the vibrations were God awful.  I asked for a re-balance, the very next day (after two balances) I had to bring my car in once again. I was told they didn't balance them but just rotated them, but they will balance them correctly this time. Once again same issue, I gave Twinsburg Goodyear one last shot to see if they could get it right... they didn't. 
After spending some more money and countless hours of my time I finally made an appointment with a local dealer and they were able to solve the issue right away. I quote them ""the tires were mounted wrong on the rims and no matter how 'balanced' they were, my ride would have never been smooth"". They performed a road force test on them and mounted them correctly, and low and behold my ride is silky smooth.. 

Not sure if Twinsburg Goodyear has machines out of calibration or techs that aren't trained but I will not be back.",-1
trn_5469,"My wife ordered catfish witch came with grits and grilled okra. I ordered the fried chicken that did not include sides so I added the mac and cheese. I was so pumped to try this as I am a fried chicken fanatic. 

They tell you that each item comes out as it is ready and I liked that except that my chicken came out first and twenty minutes later, no other food had arrived and we hadn't seen our waiter. We ate the chicken which was good but didn't seem to be fresh and was only warm. The waiter then came by and asked if we wanted to see a desert menu! We said we haven't even had all our food. He apologized and said he would get on it right away. A manager came by with some biscuits on the house, which were fantastic. My wife's catfish and my mac and cheese arrived about five minutes later. 

The catfish was a little greasy and needed salt. We were not impressed to say the least. The waiter also comped us a bread pudding to go. It was a little weird as it had popcorn bits and M n M's sprinkled on top. We didn't care for it.

I don't think we will return. $26 for four small pieces of chicken and no sides is crazy. $10 for mac and cheese made my dinner $36 and while I know it's Vegas but this is way over the top.

The management team was great though and really help to make things right without us complaining.",-1

trn_5473,"I went here twice in two days. The first for lunch, where I had the salad with tuna, hard boiled egg, oven dried tomatoes, and haricot verts and a GF peanut butter bacon cookie. The cookie was so amazing! I was dubious at first of the flavour but was really surprised at how much I liked it! If you're looking for a quick salad, this is a good option because they are pre-made with your choice of dressing on the side.
The next day I came back for breakfast with a friend. Although the experience was fine, I was a little bit irked with the service. First, we wanted to share the ""frittata"" and a smoothie. It is unclear on the menu that it's actually a frittata sandwich served on a roll. Being gluten free, my friend asked for a substitute for the bread -- anything without wheat. The girl helping us said we could get the granola/yoghurt INSTEAD of the bread, but when we went to check out she charged us for the whole parfait. If I hear ""instead of"" without a follow up of a price change, I assume it's for free and don't want to be charged for it. We ended up having just the frittata without bread which was fine. The other problem was that I asked for almond milk for my coffee and the girl said they didn't have any almond milk but could give me soy milk. But we had ordered the ""April smoothie"" which had almond milk in it and when I asked about that she said, ""oh right, I was going to make it with soy milk."" We ended up not having a problem with the soy milk, but I think it's dangerous to not mention it because it is possible we had a soy allergy and specifically ordered the smoothie because of the almond milk! We didn't mind the soy milk in the smoothie at all, but I think it is something they should have mentioned to us before making it.
I wanted to get another peanut butter bacon cookie, but they said they don't sell them at breakfast which is a huge bummer! I hope I can come back and have it again another time soon.",1

The tables in Nora's were not all full, yet in the time i would be able to drive back home, make myself my own burger, eat it, drive back to Noras, and have a full whole-hearted conversation with my family, my burger would still not have been ready! The fries are shit and taste like baby food, the pickles tasted like someone blew out their cigarette smoke on them, the chips were some ratchet ass off brand lays potato chips, the swiss cheese on the burger looked like the cook jacked off and cummed all over the bun, and the burger itself made it seem like later at night i'd be shitting my guts out.

Ordered cold brew coffee and one of the bagel sandwiches that they are known for. 

The cold brew cost the rate I usually pay; however, came in a very small glass and was mostly ice. The bagel sandwich took over 20 minutes to receive, and the bagel was hard. I couldn't even bite through it. 

The space was comfortable, and I can see why people come in. I'd give the bagel sandwich another shot, but definitely not the cold brew coffee as I got maybe 4 sips.",0

We were very disappointed about everything : the service and the food. The service was very slow despite the restaurant was not that full when we went on a Thursday night. We got seated right away and ordered our food within a few minutes . We ordered a wrap and a salad with shawarma plate, simple stuff and should be fairly fast to prepare . We waited for 30-40 mins and I finally got the waiter's attention and was going to ask him about the status of our order. He asked me if we are ready to order ... No, well you took our order 30 mins ago , so yeah, they totally forgot about the order. We wait for another 5-10 mins for the food. The food finally came and I was very disappointed at the potion , to add shawarma on the salad costs $4.99 but it was only a few small piece of shawarma chicken on it. The portion of the salad was very little, not worth that much at all. I normally don't leave a bad review but I was really disappointed with this place.

trn_5506,"I'm a fair skinned girl. I know that, I've accepted it. I don't need some snooty salesperson to point it out to me like it's a disease.

I went into MAC looking for a foundation in my never-ending quest to find the perfect shade for my fair skin. I asked a salesman to colour-match me. ""Oh honey!"" he says ""You're so pale you're going to be our lightest shade, you're like a vampire."" Gee, thanks. Nothing like a little blow to your self-esteem to help enhance your shopping experience. I kept expecting him to personally drag me to the nearest tanning salon.

I was too polite to just walk out and proceeded with the process of getting matched. He put liquid foundation, concealer, and powder on me. When I got to look in the mirror I began to think I really did look like a vampire. He'd put so much makeup on me I looked like a cakey ghost. My face was WHITE. As white as if if had been covered with flour. I am FAIR SKINNED, not GHOSTLY WHITE. I have undertones in my skin that are pink, I have a little colour in my cheeks. I look ALIVE. Somehow he'd managed to make me look like a corpse. My neck had visibly more colour in it than the makeup he'd put on my face.

And I had portobello sandwich. Marinara sauce was very watery and had no flavor. It was so bad I had an urge to make my own pasta sauce at home (which I did  ). My portobello was soaked in balsamic it burned my mouth. And the mushroom wasn't even cleaned properly. It's sad that places where they really care about the quality of food they serve have to close (speaking of Sweetie Fry) and places like this one are open...cmon, it's not hard to make good pasta sauce",-1
trn_5508,"Must say everyone at this location was super friendly and very helpful. I was picked up by Aaron and was brought to the branch. They were very limited in the selections of cars. They had 1 small car, 1 huge truck and a mini van. My reservation was for a full-size vehicle which they obviously didn't have. Ty (branch mgr) and Aaron was going to give me the van for no extra charge for a day or two as I waited for another vehicle to switch with or until I was able to speak to the third party insurance company paying for my rental. I decided to take the small car as I didn't need anything big like the van or the F150 truck they had. Plus, I didn't want to have a gas hustler. Long story short, I called the next morning to see if they got any cars I could exchange with as the one I had was way too small for the two car seats I needed. Unfortunately, they didn't. Ty and Tony (asst mgr) helped me by contacting another branch and arranging my Switch. I had no issues at all. They worked with me and ensured I didn't leave without a vehicle. Way to go guys!

The wait can be longish at times which is a good sign unless I need in-and-out... but don't let a crowd scare you off, sometimes there's families outings and sometimes it's friends sharing a couple adjectives.
These fellows do a nice job on my hairs; it's a basic haircut but I'm not a fancy man. Starts with the trimmer and takes a little off the top, sides, and back until the shagginess is gone, what's left is a respectable haircut (MLB said so) Finishes the edges with hot foam and a straight razor followed by a warm towel...

I slowly cut through a thin layer of the top and saw a big chunk of raw egg white! Without cutting through, I asked the server if I can have it more cooked. They took the plate back, it came back when my friend was done with her food. They didn't apologize or compensate us for anything g at the end. Also one of the two eggs were still uncooked. And when I say that I am ok with runny egg yolk usual to eggs Benedict. I am talking about a big chunk of raw egg white!

The staff is always happy to make recommendations if you're feeling indecisive. I love ordering takeout from here too.",1
trn_5517,"Have not had the pleasure of checking out their store, but I did hit up the food truck when they visited ASU.  Awesome key lime!  The graham crust was amazing- buttery and delicious.  The crust on the chocolate pie was good too, and I don't usually care for standard pie crust.

The mini pies could feed two people, but we destroyed one full dessert each.

Posting a calendar on their website that shows dates and locations for the food truck was a brilliant move- everyone in my office is excited that they come to Tempe once a week.

One suggestion- the website does not appear to list business hours for the Phoenix pie shop.",1
trn_5518,"Condescending service, and, as the previous reviewer mentioned, very little selection for small band sizes. 

They won't sell a bra without sizing you first, and don't welcome walk-ins (while I was in the store, the saleswoman told another woman to leave and book an appointment from home online or by phone, that Saturday fittings needed to be scheduled at least a week in advance -- how's that for service?).  They also refuse to order sizes they don't already carry in the store.  

Despite their promising website and what seemed to be a large selection, I would absolutely not recommend this shop, especially if you already know your bra size and/or are a petite woman.  As much as I want to support local businesses, I can say ordering online feels much better than dealing with these people.",-1

There may be nothing more sublime than sitting down to a dinner under the purple aura that permeates even the bubbles in my glass of champagne. There are ENDLESS wonderful things on the menu however before deciding what to narrow down the choice to, one must take in the brilliant atmosphere. Order ANYTHING on the menu, it will be good. My favorites include, the rock shrimp, the garbage salad, the bolognese pasta, the mac and cheese, the gnocchi, never mind the yummy steaks!!! 
Order to your hearts content from one of many fabulous waiters, however you must, absolutely have to save room for dessert.

The maids accused me of keeping them an extra half hour over when they were 20 minutes late. The cleaning they provided was mediocre. They left particulates everywhere in my bathroom even after I asked them to look at it again. I will attach pictures which include dust bunnies visible from the center of the room, dirty toilets, and a dirty counter left for me to clean. 

The management will not help you. They will side with the maid and suggest that you purchase more services from them to fix the poor quality of the original service.",-1
trn_5521,"I feel like Sir  Ed's is a good bar but the food, while delicious is overpriced. The indoor section of the bar is dark and divey and on my last visit the AC was on full blast which made me wish I had brought a sweater out on a day where the outside temperature was well into the 80s. 

I have tried several of their menu items. My favorite meal was the seared tuna salad. I had this delicious dish one afternoon out on the patio while my dog hung out with me. The waitress was kind enough to bring him a water bowl! On a more adventurous visit I tried the ostrich meatloaf, which wasn't really my thing but I had not tried ostrich before. 

On the last visit we ordered the buffalo shrimp. I had meant to get the buffalo cauliflower because of the rave reviews but when I saw it was only a dollar more to have shrimp I changed my mind. Maybe I should have stuck with the vegetables since the shrimp were tiny and a large portion of the already small shrimp was the batter. The flavor was good but the portion seemed small for the price.

For the entrée I decided to pretend like I eat healthy and ordered the stuffed zucchini (with goat cheese fritters and a vegetable ragu). The sauce and the zucchini was delicious but the fritters were cold and unappealing. I gave them both away after I had a bite. You don't want to give away food when you paid $13 for a vegetarian dish. 

The beer selection is pretty good (they have fortnight on tap!) but I don't think they carry oranges for Blue Moon. I have ordered it twice there and each time no orange slice for me even after I asked for one which is a shame because I love snacks with my drinks.",0

trn_5524,"Tonight, my first experience at Heritage was like watching The Matrix for the first time.  Ok, that might sound a bit strange but bear with me. Far away from the madness of Uptown, in the quaint, Conroy-esque setting of Waxhaw, sits this truly amazing and unique restaurant. I typically have the ability to read a menu and, based on the brief description given, visualize an assumption of what will be set before me as a final dish. At Heritage, every single time, I was so wrong - in a great way. Nowhere on the menu will you find the often intimidating terms foam, gel, reduction or sous vide. But you will find all of those elements on the beautifully built plates. Every dish was truly fun and unexpected. They were exciting and colorful. But at no point were taste or quality sacrificed for aesthetics. Every time a dish came to the table I happily reached for the menu to remind myself of its components, like reading a map of my plate. My wife and I ordered 4 of the Small Plates, 1 of the Salads and 2 of the Big Plates. Without taking up too much more of your attention span I will say that if I had to choose the highlights they would be the Watermelon Salad (favorite), the Quail Breast (close second) and the Deviled Eggs (even more close third). Actually, I will elaborate on the Deviled Eggs for just a moment. Most of the time when I see Deviled Eggs on a menu I am immediately excited but ultimately disappointed. So many times at restaurants all over Charlotte, and the Southeast for that matter, when deviled eggs arrive at the table they are far too reminiscent of the rubber balls dispensed from gum ball machines and are also sitting in a small puddle of water. The eggs at Heritage had a texture and temperature that made me believe they where shelled minutes prior. The Classic were just that, and could stand toe to toe with any at your favorite pot luck (where, in my life, I have always experienced the best of the best). In the Of the Day, with hot pepper, arugula and goat cheese on this particular day, they managed to incorporate all of those flavors in a way where I could taste and appreciate them but still know what I was eating - a deviled egg. 
I remember walking out of the movie theater,  having just seen The Matrix, and wishing that I could see it all over again for the first time. I realised tonight, after we left Heritage, that I had the same feeling. I wished I could go back and order those dishes again for the first time, not knowing how they would look or taste when they came to the table. I guess the best part is that we did not order everything on the menu - so there are more surprises to be had. Hats off to the great group they have in the kitchen and out in front. We had excellent service and a great experience and will certainly be back soon - with friends.",1

Not the experience I was looking for, especially for $50. I have had my nails done a few times at this place and my experience has been good, so I'm not sure what happened today. Even when trying to being it up a few times, nothing was done.

In addition,  I felt so uncomfortable that I went somewhere else just to get a toe nail polish change. I really wanted a pedicure from this place, but after being told ""you're done"" and the guy walking off on me, I decided to seek services elsewhere. I really felt disrespected as a customer.",-1

Over all, I really liked the place.  My biggest complaint about most Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh is the cheesy and shabby looking  interior. Unlike most other places, this place is very  neat, cute, and looks more like a cafe, not a traditional Korean restaurant.

trn_5538,"I wish I could compliment this hospital. I had my own horrible experience and was not happy when I found out my mom was here. My mom was in the E.R. and treated by Trevelyn on 8/4/2013 around 4am. My mom was very dissatisfied, because no information about her condition was communicated. Things just got worse when she was admitted around 3pm. The entire staff lacked any urgency and real competency. They could not answer simple questions or respond quickly. Her doctor was Dr. Achin, her demeanor is very unprofessional and derogatory. After seeing my mom had Pancreatitis she put her on a unrestricted diet. You can die from Pancreatits and are supposed to fast. Dr. Achin became very defensive when I tried to ask any questions about why my mom was put on an unrestricted diet and admitted she did not know what was really going on inside my mom. But she knew she had early Pancreatitis. She said a G. I. specialist would come and look at my mom and another test MRCP would be performed. We waited all night and no test. I left my information with the nurse and was never called with any updates. I got a call from my dad that my mom went in for the MRCP about 10am. No updates from the nurse! When I arrived at about 12pm. My mom had just gotten done taking the MRCP. I asked to speak to the charge nurse who was Myra and Patient Advocacy. Mrya did not show any concern or care for my mom's treatment. She could not tell me anything. (When the G.I. specialist would come today or not, why I wasn't called by their staff when my mom went in for the test, why we weren't told the MRI machines close at 5pm in admittance and we waited all night for my mom to have the test done). She did call Dr. Achin who could not be reached. Another patron arrived looking for someone to visit and Myra read allowed all the patient names of those on the 3rd floor wing that she had. Is this even legal???
 Dr. Achin arrived about 3:00pm on the 3rd floor and could be heard yelling into the phone for the G.I. doctor to come. Although it was unprofessional to yell loud enough so patients inside their room could here it was probably the only thing she did do with any urgency.  When she came in to see my mom she had no answers as to what was wrong. She said she had no diagnosis and no plan. I was taking notes as she was going over my mom's vitals and I asked her if she could slow down. Myra was also present. I asked Dr. Achin politely if she could slow down and clarify. Her English is a little hard to understand due to her accent. At this point she started waving papers and said I will give this to you!!! I calmly asked her why she was getting an attitude. She yelled and said she wasn't. I looked over at Myra who rolled her eyes but remained silent. My mom asked Dr. Achin when she thought she could be released. Dr. Achin said if you feel better now. At this point I firmly spoke up and said how can you let her leave without reviewing her test results from this morning and without seeing the G.I. specialist?? Dr. Achin got even more defensive. My mom who has high anxiety at this point said she just wanted to leave because the situation was too stressful. I told her she could not leave until she saw the specialists and insisted she stay. Dr. Achin just left the room. I got my mom to calm down and agree to stay. 

Outside the room I spoke to Myra and expressed this quality of care was unacceptable. She said, ""You are making your mom upset"" in front of 2 other nurses and another doctor. I said, ""Excuse me you are blaming me?"" I said I wanted to speak to risk management and patient advocacy. She called patient advocacy and got voicemail. She said I could leave and they would call me. I said I would not leave until I spoke to someone. She yelled maybe we need to call security and walked out into another part of the hospital. 

At this point I went downstairs to the main desk and asked to speak to Patient Advocacy. Pat, a women volunteer called and got voicemail. I told her I would wait. About 15 minutes later Barbara Streyle came over. She was very professional and listened to what happened. She immediately knew who Dr. Achin was and described her beside manner as abrupt. At the time I felt she took my concerns about my mom's Pancreatits seriously and genuinely cared. She went up to check on my mom and also to get my cell phone charger. Ms. Streyle said she would get my mom a nicotine patch which my mom never received. 

Later my dad went to see my mom and said the G.I specialist disagreed with Dr. Achin and wanted to run more tests. After running another test they still could not find anything other than Pancreatits. The G.I doctor told my mom not to drink for 6 weeks and to come back and get another scan then. She was then discharged. Great job Mountain View! Great job!",-1
trn_5539,"Came here on a Thursday night at 6:30 p.m. My friends and I had a reservation, but it was not needed - the place was almost empty.

SERVICE: Extremely Poor

While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. 

MAIN: Caprese Salad

The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).

MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it) 

These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you visit this restaurant, I would recommend this particular dish, especially given the price ($8) and the portion size (it was quite large - almost the size of a large plate).",-1

The sides I chose, Chipotle Mac & Cheese and Asparagus.  Both were excellent and the Mac and Cheese wasn't very spicy at all.  There was nothing processed tasting on the Mac & Cheese (which seems to be a common thread when ordering out versus making your own).  It was rich and cheesy...oh and the noodle style they chose hung onto every cheesy saucy drip...yum!  The Asparagus was roasted to perfection.  The finishing touch was the berries and cream.  Such a fresh and celebrated taste, I couldn't have asked for more.  Just as a warning, you are paying higher end prices but you are also getting good service (at least I did) and excellent food.",1

The fish cakes were quite dense with strong hints of coriander and lemongrass. 

We ordered a chicken green curry and a pork and eggplant stir-fry. The curry was great, full of rich, spicy flavourful gravy and nice chunks of chicken and potatoes. The stir fry was good also a nice rounded dish with great slices of Aubergine nicely fried to soft consistency.

trn_5546,"I'm going to give this place 5 stars.  While the food is not the absolute best Indian food that I've had, the price was excellent.  I had the special of the day, which was a chicken leg and thigh on a spicy, flavourful bed of rice.  With tax, the meal came to about $4.50. That's a pretty damn good price for a homecooked meal.  I'm definitely going back.  It gets 5 stars, because that same meal would have cost 10$ at most other Indian food restaurants.  The place was clean and ambiance and the atmosphere were really calm and relaxing.  I liked the music they were playing in the background.

A place is either 5 stars - 4 if it's good, but a little pricy, or 1 star if it's crap. There really is no middle ground when it comes to food or any product that you pay money for.  It's either good or it's not.",1

Both times we've been here (on a Thursday around 6pm), they have had a great crowd and lots of fun people. Definitely a place you feel like staying and hanging out in.

trn_5549,"Just trying to mix up my cardio and hitting up parks lately.  When it comes to any park, it's tough not to be a fan.  This park is quiet during the day.  But once 5 PM hits, it gets pretty busy.  This park is off Aliante Parkway in between Nature Park & Deer Springs.  You can chose to off Deer Springs or Nature Park.  Both will get busy, but the Nature Park side fills up quickly.  

There's plenty to do here;
-Huge grass fields, both flat and hills
-Picnic Area
-Duck ponds (just watch, no feeding and definitely no swimming)
-Outdoor tennis courts
-Outdoor sand volleyball
-Playground

I need to comment on the playground. It's fenced in for children's safety and it gets packed.  This is where everyone goes. You got kids running around enjoying while their parents sit in the middle benches either talking with each other or messing with their phones.  Tons for kids to do at this park and if I still had a little one, we'd go here for sure.  Sorry, didn't take pictures this time around. 

The main reason for hitting up this park was simple.  I needed to hit the ATM, get gas, and wanted to throw a quick 3 mile run in.  Aliante Nature Discovery Park was perfect for my needs since there is a gas station across the street and my bank. I circled the park, which is exactly .75 miles if you stay on the path. After one orbit, I took my running to the streets.  Overall, not a bad park and I'm sure I'll be back if I ever need gas, money, and a quick run again.",1

Great alternative to a club, and there's a lot of games to choose from.  We had a lot of laughs, and was sad when their coffee machine shut down at 10pm, as we were there until 2am.  That's a loss of sales for the venue, as we would have kept buying cappacinos.",1
trn_5552,"This is my second time here. The first time when they first open I came for a birthday celebration but the service and food was terrible. Our sashimi was frozen. 

However, they have improved. Came for dinner for two on a Friday at 6 pm. Parking lot fills up fast since there so many businesses in the complex. The front host wasn't attentive stood there flipping through paper while a line formed. Not until the lady in front spoke up did he started to seat people.

The atmosphere at this restaurant is open and modern. Lots of seating and clean. The waitress was friendly and came by often to get our order. The food was really good. We love the beef tataki the most. Portions are small but that prevents waste. 

It's a bit expensive for deluxe all you can eat is $35. Overall all the sushi options were delicious and I would come back.  For the sweet tooth lovers there ice cream for dessert!",0
trn_5553,"We ate there yesterday for the first time. My husband ordered fish tacos and I had the five shrimp with sticky rice. He loved his dish. The fish had a nice, slightly spicy sauce on them. It was Mahi Mahi. The shredded veggies were also just perfect. He said he would order it again. I also liked the dish I had. The asparagus was delightful. The rice section was very bland, but our waitress brought some soy sauce for me. This improved everything. I would just ask for soy sauce when ordering this dish again. I would order it again. We also shared a small dessert in a glass. It was boston cream pie. Very tasty. I was happy they had the nice, little desserts. Anything else would have been too much. It was perfect. We will definitely go back. The prices were very reasonable.",1
trn_5554,"This place is decent. I was really surprised by the grilled squid...which was tasty, crispy and flavorful considering the fact that it was not deep fried or sauced.

The sushi is standard, the atmosphere is chilled and the service is quick. It doesn't seem like it would handle a big rush well though...management should think about that.

I don't think this place deserves a 1 star rating and maybe I'm giving a generous 4 stars to bring that rating up...

It's worth checking out at least...",1

My first visit required complicated color, since I had been sick for three months, and unable to update my bleach blonde style. I had two inch black roots with orange tinted highlights underneath. With no trepidation, Ashley created a beautiful combination of light roots, scattered lowlights, with a long layered haircut that gave me some much needed shape. She was friendly, kind, efficient, and a good listener. I was visiting my parents from out of state, and already have my next appointment with her booked!  She is a very talented hair artist!",1

..... both positive and negative opinions. My recent breakfast experience was mixed. One of a group of 5, I was happy 5hat we were able to be seated quickly. Though I didn't find the hostesses particularly welcoming, our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. The menu was a mix of every day favorites as well as some specialty items. The  choices were amazing and certainly tempting. Everyone in my party got something different. My own more traditional breakfast was okay but not any more than that. The temperature of my eggs and grits was tepid at best. I was also taken aback slightly at the price. For an ordinary meal I  thought it was pricey. Paying at the counter I was once again disappointed in the cool demeanor of the staff. No thank you, how was it, or hope to see you again. I don't know if I will return because I've enjoyed better meals, better prices and a more friendly ambiance at other restaurants.",0

Maybe we weren't expecting a lot since the tickets were very reasonable (expecially through one of those half-price tix places) however we thought the show was great.  Glad we noticed the good reviews here on Yelp. Definitely a good choice to fill a couple of afternoon hours if you want to get off the casino floor.,1

trn_5565,"Archery Headquarters recently had a Groupon for a one-hour introductory lesson.  The time is kind of inconvenient (6-7PM for the Groupon folks at least), but it was a cool experience.  I have zero archery experience, and the instructor (Barry) gave everyone a clear but concise lesson on how to hold a bow, nock the arrow, and release the arrows.  Barry seemed to truly enjoy teaching and practicing archery, and his enthusiasm helped to make for a fun experience.  We had a great time and would definitely recommend.

Archery HQ has several more courses for people who are interested in improving their skills.  I haven't participated in these, but at least from the intro class, I would anticipate the rest of the courses to be worthwhile.",1
trn_5566,"This was my first visit to any plastic surgeon.  I called to get a consultation appointment.  Candice was amazing, warm, friendly and knowledgeable.  I am interested in getting a mommy makeover and facial fillers.  Candice asked questions and informed me of the cost of different procedures.  I really had no idea how much it would cost and really appreciated her being so upfront.  She took so much time to answer my questions.  I felt like I was speaking to a good friend.  Candice scheduled a convenient appointment for me.  A few days later Candice called me and asked if I would like to come in sooner, she had a cancellation.  I took the earlier appointment.  The office is beautiful, clean, white and nicely decorated.  Candice has a warm welcoming smile and knew me by name already.  She really is amazing!  She asked if I would like water, how nice is that?  She took me right back to another beautiful room.  She set me up with some videos about the procedures that interested me.  They were very informative.  As soon as I was done watching the videos Dr. Olson comes into the room and introduces himself.  He asks questions about what I would like to achieve.  I was most excited about Botox and fillers when I arrived.  I have these bags under my eyes that drive me crazy.  He patiently explains how he can use filler on my cheeks to help smooth out under my eyes.  He explains that it will not completely take them away but it will help.  I am totally on board.  He explains different breast and tummy tuck procedures.  He asks questions about what I would like to achieve.  Dr. Olson has tons of photos of previous patients before and after photos.  He has done beautiful work. He also had different implant choices and explained the pros and cons of each.  He is very nice and knowledgeable.  After that he takes me in for an exam.   His assistant was present for the exam.  He was very professional.  He nicely informed me that I have tuberous breasts.  I had no idea, now I have a name for my weird breasts.  This knowledge was really quite a relief.  I have always felt weird about my breasts.  He explains what he can do tells me he can liposuction on the side of my breasts if I want to get rid of that.  I absolutely do, no more side boob!!!  I have more side boob than regular boob.  I think this was my favorite discovery!  He leaves the room and I get to try out implant sizes with his assistant.  She is super nice and helpful.  I see myself for the first time with a shape.  I almost cried.  I have long, big, boxy body and have always felt unfeminine(is that a word).  At this moment I am in,  I can see the future me and am so relieved.  Dr. Olsen's assistant asks if I would like to get filler today.  Absolutely, I did not expect them to start the same day!  Dr. Olson was amazing, funny and totally put me at ease.  I got my filler and am so happy with the results.  I meet with the office manager to go over costs of  the remainder of my wish list and have a nice folder of information.  I know it seems crazy that this is the first plastic surgeon I visit and he is the one!  I end up communicating with a couple of his previous patients via Yelp.  It was so nice of them to respond to my questions.  I read all the reviews possible on Dr. Olsen and they are all amazing.  I cannot wait to book my surgery!  I will update once I have undergone my surgery!",1

I ordered a Chicken Avocado Sandwich and the Chicken Pasta on the side recommended by the cashier. I usually like trying something new so I like asking the workers what they think is good...bad move on my part. When I picked up the sandwich it fell apart... but the parts that I did eat were decent. The Chicken Pasta was Pink! I love that color and I'm not picky so I tried it. It was sweet and sour and I maybe found one tiny piece of chicken in it. I couldn't eat a third bite and my husband couldn't stomach a second bite. I left it alone and sipped on my sugar free Watermelon Juice. I liked that they have sugar free options but I didn't like that they didn't put ice in my drink especially when it's so hot outside! My husband had the Chicken Caesar Wrap and a side of salad. I tried the wrap and that tasted fresh and the salad was also good. The salad was big for being a side item. The food was okay but it's nothing I would  crave for.,-1

This excludes the meat and deli counter, those guys... Those guys are cool people. 

Speaking of the deli counter I picked up $15 worth of almond chicken yesterday and it was so dry and overcooked the texture reminded me of jerky and the when sawwed open the chicken was a clear plastic texture/color. It was bizzare probably from being overcooked, anyway it's no longer edible so that's $15 down the drain. Aside from that experience I usually enjoy most of the items from the salad bar and prepared food counter.

Super thin light huge tortillas.  Excellent bean burros.  Good beef tacos.  Solid menudo and breakfast burros.

L&Ls has great tasting food, love the Mongolian beef flat-bread and the Honey Walnut Chicken.   The service is excellent and location is great.  Adequate parking and not far from 101 but not buried around 90th and 92nd St.

And Carol, the meatloaf is probably only on the menu for kids (or adults) who choose something safe sounding... don't think its fair to grade them on meatloaf...  I don't critic meatloaf (even when it just 3 stars) on a Asian/fusion/whatever-it-is menu!

trn_5582,"Service:
I feel like our server pronounced the name Brian kinda weird, just putting that out there. He also used the 1st-person possessive to describe all of the menu items, which our party had split feelings about. Some us felt that it added familiarity to the experience, like he was taking ownership of the food and we appreciated it. But also, are they really your specials?
They got one of the orders in our party wrong and were super apologetic about it and gave it to her on the house. They really went above and beyond. We are pretty sure that they were filming an episode ""Undercover Bosses"" actually. But either way, it was very sweet, and made us feel a little bad for making fun of the Brian pronunciation.

Decor: Sort of industrial pop or rustic/retro with a cowboy flare.

Food: The burgers we very good, we'd expect nothing less from the genius mind of chef Michael Symon. And we loved the pickle bar thing, like we literally could not wait to try it before our food came. Don't go for the salads though, someone in our party had to pay like $15 for a ""just okay"" salad with chicken. And she was not into that at all. The milkshakes are expensive but tasty and very generous, enough for two.

Thank you Brian and ""the Chew's"" Michael Symon for a culinary adventure!",1

The veggieballs are just some kind of flour reminiscent of corn flour and a few veg thrown in, the vegan sausage sandwich was more like meatless ground tossed in some marinara that tasted okay but seemed to come from a jar. The Italian dressing, supposedly vegan, was just bad. According to Jason, the steak sandwich was like what you get in a package at Costco. Not bad taste, just generic.

They didn't bring the veggieballs with the other non-vegan appetizers and the meal as a whole was delayed so long we thought the order was forgotten. We almost walked out twice.

The atmosphere and energy of the performers, crowd, and business owners was positive and energetic. People were so friendly, humbled, and everyone was enjoying themselves. Plenty of vendors, from dessert shops, to vegan soul food, to handcrafted product booths. There were so many new restaurants, artists, and businesses I've never even heard of until I stumbled upon them at this event. 

Food trucks, grills, and asian/indian restaurants in the area were present cooking up very reasonable portions if their food for very reasonable prices. COME HUNGRY. There is something for everyone here. If you're in the mood for a cocktail (think kimchi bloody marys, or infused and spiked lemonades), beer, or just a non-alcoholic bubble teas, they have it. 

Left here feeling highly impressed and super proud of my city and all of the great businesses and food we have to offer. Can't WAIT to come back next year!

NOTE: If you don't like crowds, come right at opening time. Perhaps it was just because it was raining earlier, but we came around 6 and there were no lines, ample photo taking opportunities, and plenty of space for walking. Crowd started picking up at 7-730.",1

I was recovering from foot surgery and barely able to get back and forth from work so the logistics of getting my car repaired was difficult.

trn_5592,"You lose all sense of time in Vegas, so when we decided it was probably time for dinner, it turned out it was only about 4pm and we were nearly the only ones in the place for dinner which was great. We walked by about 2 hours later and the line was a mile long - so that was definitely a benefit of going off-hours if you can. 

Overall it was a hit and miss buffet, as I'm assuming many of the standard casino buffets are. I actually really enjoyed most of my dinner, but that is because I just cast aside all the things I tried and didn't like. It seems really wasteful to me, but some of it was just that bad. Among the things that were that bad were the ribs, the chicken, and some of the vegetables I tried. And the hushpuppies were among the worst things I've ever ingested - I'm not sure they weren't meant to be dog food instead. 

However, the seafood selection was fantastic, and I indulged myself on many oysters, crab legs, crawfish (I was ecstatic someone from New Orleans!), shrimp, and salmon. I had an overflowing plate of each before I threw in the towel and called it a successful buffet. 

I was too stuffed to go for any of the desserts at that point, but there didn't seem to be too many that looked that great anyways. 

The staff was also very friendly and available, but again we were some of the only patrons at the time. 

If you're a seafood fan, this buffet hits the mark. If not, you might want to look elsewhere.",0
trn_5593,"We've been VERY desperate for good Mexican food ever since Mas Amigos/Don Juan's closed.  Just learned about El Patio a couple of weeks ago, and we were eager to try it in the hopes that finally there might be a place where we would be excited about the Mexican food. Because I am a native Texan, this is a lot more important to me than to most in this area.

Alas. Suffice it to say that, not only did I not finish my cheese enchiladas (I did finish the taco), I didn't even bother to take the considerable leftovers home with me. Not very tasty. The same was true of the guacamole as well as the ""spicy"" salsa that they bring out only to those who request it (it was NOT very spicy). Just not a lot of taste anywhere on the table. WHY, O WHY  did the new proprietor of Mas Amigos/Don Juan's run it into the ground?

One positive thing I can say is that, unlike nearly every Mexican restaurant we've visited, this one did NOT have a television, and to us that's a very good thing.

I also should say that the wait staff were very pleasant and helpful. Kudos to them.",-1
trn_5594,"I feel like most of my Yelp reviews of hotels begin this way, but.. I booked the Hilton Toronto on Hotwire and it was seriously awesome. Coming in at just over $90 after taxes and fees, or about half the going rate, it was an awesome value.

Right downtown, the location was super convenient, just a few blocks from Union Station, Queen St., and right next to a subway stop. I got a room on the 29th floor and the views are great as well. I literally spent the first fifteen minutes in my room just staring out and peoplewatching.

The rest of the hotel isn't anything amazing or stand-out -- it's no boutique hotel -- but service was quick, friendly, and efficient.

My colleague also booked through Hotwire but was able to double-dip and use his HHonors membership to get a room on the executive (31st) floor, lounge access, and points towards his account. The lounge is pretty sweet and I'd say lives up to the other reviews.

Finally, WiFi was free for me, but I'm not sure if that's a result of being up on the higher floors or if that's hotel-wide.

Either way, it was a nice place to stay and a welcome change from my company's usual Ajax hotel!",1

The combo was just what I wanted, six pieces of wings, with two different flavors. Some blue cheese, french fries, Texas toast. Not to mention, a drink! You get a lot. I did get a little side order of carrots, but it wasn't expensive at all.

Today, we were feeding the wonderful volunteers that are remodeling our church. They are so kind & generous for devoting their free time to our church. So, I placed an order for the 30 wings special. I ordered it ahead of time and it was ready when I got there. Everything was there. And, I really like the way that they separated the cold items and put them in a separate bag.

Everybody loved the wings including myself. I will definitely continue coming here either for the lunch special just for myself or if in the future, there will be another party, I will definitely get their large wings special deal again!

My friend asks the waiter about Saki. The waiter states he knows nothing about the saki or food there because he does not eat there. WTH???  So my friend wound up ordering Saki he liked but there was a Saki menu hidden behind a tray of condiments some of which he would have liked better .

trn_5606,"Hostess ? told us she would get the manager and asked for our name.  I was confused, didn't know why she had to get the manager so I asked if there was a wait.  She tells us no, but wants our name to seat us and has to get the manager.  
I give her my name and we wait about 5 minutes to be seated and she comes back and seats us.
What just happened?

Our server eventually makes it to our table, takes our drink order after I inquire about how they make their Bourbon Sours here.  Silly me, I want it like the old school Whiskey Sour with that maraschino cherry sunk in the bottom.  She's not sure if they include that but she's gonna add it per my request.
Don't ask me why but I was in the mood for a classic cocktail.  Something my Mom or Dad might have drank back in the 50's or 60's.
Here ya go:
1 1/2 ounces whiskey (or bourbon, Scotch, Canadian whiskey, or Irish whiskey)
4 ounces sour mix, recipe follows
Crushed ice
1 maraschino cherry
Combine the whiskey and sour mix in a large old-fashioned glass with ice. Stir, garnish with cherry, and serve.
Sour Mix: 
1-ounce lemon juice
1-ounce sugar
2 ounces water
Combine lemon juice and sugar, then dilute with water and stir to dissolve sugar

My cocktail arrived and was more reminisce of bourbon with bar sour mix.  
It was okay, but not what I had hoped for.

Dinner was a veggie plate combo for me and my husband ordered the ribs.
Server brings over dinner rolls and our salads.  Dinner rolls were darker than usual and they were hard.  So hard that I thought there was a greater risk to my teeth than what I might experience from biting an apple.
I am not exaggerating.
Our server came by again, not to check on us but to apologize because there were no more ribs and she wanted to find out what other entrée my husband would like.
So he orders up the Chicken Fried Steak and she thought he might want to change his sides but he opted to leave that the same.
I also asked if we could get some fresh rolls and she then apologized for the quality of what was initially delivered to the table because the current batch was in the oven.
No worries, when they're done we'd like to have a couple.
When our meals are finally delivered a basket of rolls are brought along with.  
Hot, Hot, Hot dinner rolls.  Burning hot.  So hot I cut it with my knife and fork so it would cool off a bit.
But oh they were soft and much easier to eat.  

Overall our server was pleasant.
The food was okay.  
The cocktail was okay.
The water was horrible -or maybe it was my glass.
I wouldn't opt to go there again anytime soon.  It was only because I had a gift card did we opt to go there and use it.
I think we'll stick with one of the other steak and ribs restaurants next time.",-1
trn_5607,"Alright...I have been coming to this theater since 1990 when I went and saw Dances with Wolves with my Mom. Since then I have frequented the place and have seen it go through a lot of changes. There was a time when they talked about tearing it down due to poor management. Luckily, that didn't happen and since then Regency Theaters bought it, basically gutted the theaters and put in all new seats and still kept the same prices.  I mean, two dollars everyday except on Tuesdays when the movies are only a buck!! You can't beat that. Concessions have gone up but the quality of the snacks have also gone up. They still have the Super Nacho in which you get extra cheese and I guarantee that you will run out of chips before running out of the cheese. The classic one dollar hot dogs are still good when you don't have a lot of money to spend (probably why you come by to see a cheap movie anyway). The movie sound and look are all digital now so for the money...you can't go wrong!! Anybody who complains that they are not as good as The Galaxy or Regals can go and pay the $10 to $15 bucks a ticket and the $15 tub of popcorn. I'm sticking with Tropicana...especially on a nice matinee day to just chill out. Thanks for bringing it back from almost being gone Regency!!",1
trn_5608,"It's not just good. It's not just different.... it's good different.

I am always excited when a place in my neighborhood opens. Call me old fashioned, but I've always wanted to be a cozy person that lived in a cozy neighborhood -- and for some reason cozy to me means being a regular at a handful of places that I take visiting friends to and in turn they envy me living in all my glorious coziness.

Ah, I digress.... The Sparklings took FOREVER to open but it was definitely worth the wait --- and NOT what I expected. The interior and ambiance are unmatched. It is not the type of place you'd expect to share a parking lot with Cheeburger Cheeburger. Think cufflinks and caviar...okay maybe that's a stretch but when you walk through the doors, you can't help but be impressed with the decor and detailed interior. Marble top bars, faux leather bar chairs, dim lighting...and the touch of elegance from floor to ceiling.

With that said, it's not the place you'd expect to see 'Shrimp Po Boy' or 'Club Sandwich on the menu....and that's what makes it good.....good different. The prices, menu selection, and ambiance make this a twist that works for me. It could be a formal dinner date on a Wednesday or a casual Friday happy hour.

On my first visit we ordered portobello fries, zucchini sticks, langosta bruschetta, and the bacon & date wrapped meatballs. The bruschetta was delicious and the portobello fries were my least favorite. The meatballs were my husbands favorite... i only had one small bite of it (he didn't SHARE!!) and it was very good. The zucchini sticks were good too but nothing compared to the uniquely flavored creamy bruschetta.

For our entree I had the shrimp po boy.... it came in a triangular shaped loaf filled to the brim with tempura fried shrimp, tangy spread and slaw. It was a great blend of flavors and well executed. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and he could not stop raving about it. 

When the bill came we felt like we had a steal of a deal. The service was on point. The food presentation was just as elegant as the location and it didn't break the bank. I know the restaurant is in it's honeymoon period but I hope it keeps up the good work.

The owners of Soyo and Oyshi have outdid themselves. The Sparklings is a great new addition to the southwest area. I'm actually having a fancy dinner with friends tonight and you'll never guess where we're going ---this cozy little place in my neighborhood.

p.s. 2nd time side note- my husband and I ordered the chicken parm and the spaghetti with mushroom & bacon cream sauce... not our favorites. Looks like the sandwiches and appetizers are the way to go---at least for now. :)",1
trn_5609,"If you love the beatles, you will love this show. End of story. It's not the same as other cirque shows, but it couldn't be. The more you know about the beatles, the more you will enjoy this show. I'm not going into detail, as I don't want to give things away. There are a lot of cirque elements, you just have to look for thrm. There are things happening everywhere and I suggest sitting farther from the stage to catch it all. The people up close seemed to be missing a lot, and they paid far more than I did to see this show. 

So, all in all, sit midway to the back to enjoy the ENTIRE show!",1
trn_5610,"This place was good.... average. A-OK not much more. I wanted to sample a few of his dishes before we went ""all in""  The best dish we had was the Kusshi oysters and the littleneck clams.  Ok not much cooking here , but the shellfish presentation, freshness, and mignonette sauce were fantastic.  With that said.... I expect all the raw shellfish as well as sashimi to be extremely fresh (that should be a given) anything less really is unacceptable for any high end place!! . We did try the lobster wrap, a seafood ""esciveche""  basically a ceviche, and the clam chowder.  The lobster wrap kinda had a Vietnamese feel to it . The ""Esciveche"" was like a lighter Ceviche, it was almost kinda plain with a little added from the bell peppers and cucumbers. Now it does sound a little like Japanese sunomono (which they also had on the menu) the clam chowder was a bit disappointing as I really like the creamy New England style. This was something like a creamy bacon stew with a few clams .....too fancy for such a simple classic dish. 
  I know I am the first person to say that seafood done right is very simple preparation ! However I do feel that sometimes a chef does something  that really enhances the flavors of the seafood.... RM Seafood is not that.  It is good , but it is nothing that warrants these types of prices......stick to the raw bar here (expensive too)",0
trn_5611,"Our family trip to Toronto kicked off with a visit to the Legoland Discovery Center.  Thanks to the advertisement for Legoland in the intro of the Lego Movie, my 4-year-old son just HAD to go.  
The tickets are cheapest when you purchase them in advance online.  The price is a *little* steep, but think about the brand- nothing that says ""Lego"" is cheap.  

Once inside the building, which is attached to a big mall, we got our reserved tickets and entered into the first section of the attraction which is all about how Legos are made.  The stations are hands-on so the kiddos can play regardless of whether they understand the process behind the production.  An employee explained the process of the manufacturing of the Lego brick and handed out complimentary Legoland Duplo bricks.  Our 4 year old was pretty interested at this point.  Our 2 year old, eh, but he was a little young for this section anyway.  

Next was a really cool ride where we got to shoot lasers at bad guys and earn points.  (The points don't get you anything, but it's fun to compete with each other.)  They also take a photo and offer it for purchase when you get off the ride.

There are sections that include Lego Toronto and Lego Star Wars scenes, though disappointingly, some of the moving scenes were not operational when we went.  It is what it is, but for about $20 per person, one would think they could afford to fix these.

In the main area, there is one word: chaos!  But what else would you expect?  Build and race cars down ramps in one area (pieces were exploding everywhere!), build a skyscraper and watch it tumble with an earthquake simulator, make ice cream in the kid-size Lego Friends house (which was kind of lame, really, but maybe the kids liked it).  Also there is a section just for little ones, with tubs of Duplos and a really neat pit of gigantic foam Lego bricks.  Those were pretty cool.  A movie theatre with 4D movies running every 15 minutes is a great escape from the chaos of the main room.  A large padded playground is in the corner for kids to let off some more energy, and a full-size mechanical ride is also in the back.  For the adults and hangry children is a cafe with the obligatory overpriced food.  

All-in-all, this place is great for kids.  There is SO MUCH for them to do and it spans all age ranges.  Our four year old was happy with making cars and crashing them, and the two year old had fun stacking the giant foam Duplos into a tower.  We spent over three hours there.  When naptime came upon us and the kiddos started to break down, we left feeling satisfied with how much activity we got for the price we paid.",1

Can you say that about any babysitter or nanny you've ever had?!

Once, my husband and I forgot the closing time of KidsPark and they called us and stayed open for us until we got there.  

When we got there, none of the staff complained and were as friendly and cordial with us as always.

I actually look forward to dropping off my son at KidsPark because I know when my son is there:

1.  regardless of who is on staff, each one of them are caring and friendly.
2.  instead of being plopped in front of the tv, the staff will do craft games or play games with the kids.
3.  the place is clean, stocked with great toys (and movies), bright and cheerful.
4.  they provide great, healthy snacks.

Great policies:
1. they charge by the minute~ seriously, they do.  And they never make you feel like you are not paying them enough . . .
2. great hours
3. reasonable rates

And the best part??  

My son loves going there.  No tearful goodbyes and I feel secure that he is receiving positive, fun care!",1

I reported the incident immediately to the front desk and showed them my arm. They asked if I needed medical assistance, I said no and they moved on to the next client. Maybe they should have asked which elevator and shut it down.  The other minor issue was, even though we were staying in the luxury suite, there was no refrigerator (except for the one packed with their products) which they refused to move the products out of but for a fee they would bring up another one and no coffee pot.

trn_5627,"I always wanted to try this place, ever since reading about them in my marketing class on how Starbucks copied them and stole their spotlight.

I was in the area looking for mothers day gifts, and I decided -- why not?

I liked how simple and straight forward there menu was, which made it easy for me to find what I wanted. 
I ordered the Peach Jasmine Cold Brew Tea. It tasted more like a flower Peach then Jasmine. It did taste clean and gave an after taste of Peach. It didn't taste over concentrated with sugar; however, I do think they add too much ice since the brewed tea is already cold as it was already refrigerated. Would recommend telling them to add a little bit less ice, so I can have more iced tea.

The reason for the 4/5 star review, is I haven't tried there coffee yet.

Would recommend going here, way better than Starbucks.",1

trn_5629,"I like this place.

Body English at the Hard Rock hotel is probably the best place to party off-strip (and after the Palms, of course).  The design of Body English has a vintagey-rocker feel, which is cool.  Somewhat upscale but you can still let your hair down.  I wouldn't put this in the same category as Tryst, Pure, or Tao in terms of luxe, but it definitely has it's own appeal.  There is no other place in Vegas like Body English.  

The club itself is rather small, so you MUST get there either a) pretty early, or b) so inebriated that you don't care how crowded it is.  There really isn't that much dancing space.  But the music is cool and it's a positive vibe.  A different crowd than most of the other Vegas clubs I've been to, but always a good time.

Make sure to go on a hoppin night, like Friday or Saturday- Sundays here are generally not that fun, as other Yelpers have said in their reviews.",0
trn_5630,"Finally a place where you can actually get a healthy salad! We came for lunch with a few coworkers and everyone enjoyed themselves. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. 

A coworker and I split the veggie burger and Divaliscious salad. I had to try it, avocados, cilantro and chocolate? Yes! The salad was huge, definitely enough for a whole meal and it was fresh and full of ingredients. I only wish it had a little more cilantro and dressing. I should have asked because I'm sure the staff would accommodate. I'm kind of picky with dressings but this one was really nice. 

As for the veggie burger it was also delicious. In fact better than a lot of burgers I've had. Their fries are good too! 

They also have a make your own salad bar which really excites me, I'll have to come back for that. I'm excited to have found a place where it's safe to order a salad.",1

trn_5633,"My husband and I saw Melt on the Food Network months ago.  It looked amazing, so we decided that on our next drive out to the East Coast from Chicago, we would take a little detour.  We arrived at 2 pm on the day before Thanksgiving.  There was a 45 minute wait that included an incident where the door to my bathroom stall was rammed with a wheelchair by a staff member.  We were finally seated, and the service was chilly and slow, and ultimately our server shorted us on our change.  

It took an additional 30 minutes to order and get our food.  My husband loved his Chocolate Stout Barbecue Chicken grilled cheese.  I did NOT enjoy the Big Popper.  Designed to be like a jalapeno popper (which I love) the entire sandwich is deep fried.  Inside are two kinds of cheese, including herbed cream cheese, and fresh jalapeno slices.  It is served with mixed berry ""preserves"".  I put that word in quotes because it was more like a syrup, but still tasty.  The menu did not mention that the sandwich is dusted with powdered sugar, which I found off-putting.  Basically the entire thing tasted like hot and fried.  There was no actual flavor of the ingredients inside other than burning.  I was very disappointed.  Each sandwich comes with fries (which were average) and sweet slaw (which both my husband and I hated).

We finished up our visit with bread pudding.  It contains dark chocolate, white chocolate, butterscotch, and peanut butter chips and is served with ice cream and chocolate syrup.  It was very, very tasty, but more like a bar than bread pudding.  It was very, very firm.

The place is new and cute and has a pretty great beer list.  Our entire check--including a beer and a specialty soda, two sandwiches with sides, and dessert was around $40, so it is reasonably priced.  If I were for whatever reason in Cleveland, I would go back and try something else.",0

We have sold 4 homes over our lives. 

Getting feedback from Nate and his team was like pulling teeth and all we heard was constant excuses about how other realtors don't always provide feedback on showings. Every time there was an interested buyer it felt like we were doing more follow-up to find out their interest than our realtor.

Combined with the friendly and accommodating waiters and bar staff, atmosphere, drink specials, and DJs (decent sound system by the way), Bar Kada is easily a place to get hooked to.

I ordered an avocado toast expecting it to be light, but to my surprise it was seriously very filling. On top of the avocado was a fried egg and cherry tomatoes. It was definitely a lot better than I expected and above average when it comes to avocado toast. It also comes with potatoes on the side, which went perfectly with the meal. It's definitely a great stop for a break while shopping in the Downtown Summerlin area.",1
trn_5653,"I'm glad I didn't check Yelp for once because I had a much better experience than most seem to have had at Sammy's.  My 9 AM flight was delayed so I stopped here to eat a little breakfast.  Everyone was very nice and service itself was quick.  The food took a little long to come out, but my waitress knew I wasn't in a hurry so she may have pushed a few rush orders up.  I was able to sit at table, get some work done, and eat a normal meal instead of fast food.  My hot tea was replenished twice with not just hot water, but additional tea bags and lemons, which is more rare than you'd think.

The breakfast menu is limited to 5 dishes, but they cover your standard morning fare- eggs, French toast, yogurt, etc.  I ordered the Plain Jane Classic Eggs $10.49 (choice of eggs, meat, & toast with breakfast potatoes.)  Nothing special, but nothing wrong with any items either.  I would definitely stop here again if I was waiting for a flight in the C terminal.",1

trn_5656,"Algebra Tea House is one of the first places I tried in Cleveland when I moved here 5 years ago. I have frequented this cafe countless times since then and am absolutely in love with it. the hummus is always fresh and the harissa is a perfect addition to the any of the sandwiches/plates. My favorite things on the menu are probably the smoothies- especially the Triple Berry Soy and House smoothies. The House smoothie is probably the best smooth I have ever had! The falafel is always perfectly seasoned and not too garlicky, unlike those you may find at many other chain restaurants. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I find their milk teas a little too watery and a bit weak. Also, the quality of the food highly depends on who is on duty. The cook/cashier/server is usually excellent, but I have found that that is not consistently the case.",1
trn_5657,"We were out in the area for some shopping and noticed this wine bar's patio.  It was a wonderful unplanned stop.  The food was great - hummus, cheese plate and pizza were all super delicious.  The hummus may be the best I've had.  The service was great, as well.

The wine list was nice with reasonably priced reds and whites (about 8-10 of each) with lots of variety.  When we each decided we wanted something different for our second glass, the waitress suggested something similar to our first glass that we might like - I especially appreciated that.  

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the Solon area - especially on a nice spring or summer day!",1
trn_5658,Been coming here for over two years and always get exceptional service.  Recently had Randy one of the Service guys suggest a cleanup/detail job on my vehicle where the trim was peeling.

I read a comment below where it said a lady like that served them and my god she has been the rudest server I've ever encountered she said they don't serve horchata and then suggested that if we wanted to leave we could go and it wouldn't be a problem? What kind of service is this? She's definitely a relative to management or is management. There is no way she can get away with such rudeness. She was also rude to another couple who asked for something to go and they repeated themselves and she replied ""yes I heard you the first time"" she has no customer service skills.

trn_5673,"One star mostly because I spent some time unblissfully on the toilet in the aftermath.  Ugh.  Seriously, don't come here.  Your tummy will thank you.  There are so many options around the area, this Cantonese cafe style eatery simply isn't worth it.  

We had the crispy chicken with pepper sauce on rice and the Portuguese baked chicken, both of which are on their 'special menu' which pretty much means that you also get a non-special drink - lemon tea, coffee, milk tea, etc Don't let the drink suck you in to the special menu because the a la carte items can be cheaper, look more appetizing and sometimes also comes with vegetables.  Neither of our dishes which were $5.99 each came with a shred of greenery.  The veggie dishes on the printed menus start at $6.99 for the green beans and up to $9.99 for other veggies.  We cheaped out on the veg because the whole point for us trying this place was for cheap meal.  The chicken on both dishes seemed like the same chicken, just drenched with a different sauce.

The service was OK, though I didn't appreciate how loud the tv volume was turned up for Wayne's aforementioned Chinese show.  Parking can be a titzy in this plaza due to the small parking lot and numerous eateries.  There is an underground parking lot that closes at 9:45pm. 

For the tummy ache, the icky food and everything else... go somewhere else!",-1
trn_5674,"We love to try new breakfast places and thought we'd give this a try on a whim. The place not only has very limited parking but the entrance is confusing. Once inside, the décor is sparse and utilitarian-boring. Our waitress didn't seem very thrilled. It was blistering hot out side, we had to cram inside at one of the 6 tables. I ordered the chorizo burrito and it was bland. Large portions of bland food. The cheese on top smelled like it was getting old. Overall, we won't be back and will go back to Brunchies across the street. Darn!",-1

trn_5679,"We had a good time at Omaw and will be back.

We were a group of 6 and came this past Friday. Even though we goofed our reservation (we reserved a table for 4, instead of 6), the restaurant accommodated us the best they could with no attitude.  As the place, of course I love it because the space used to be Levack Block and is nostalgic for me.  They've also done a great job of stylishly renovating it to feel cozy/intimate.

We went during prime time and the restaurant was definitely packed, including the bar... so I recommend making a reso.

The food was solid.  Here is a quick-overview:

- Cornbread: good and the spread is tasty
- Winter vegetables/roots: really good with a pleasant sauce to accompany
- Fried chicken: everyone does a good job of fried chicken now, so this was on par with industry
- Pork ribs: these were okay and probably my least favorite dish
- Short ribs:  these were amazing! I could have had this as my main meal. Everyone at the table agreed. We ordered a second round and is the reason why I would come back.

Again, I love this place because of its past, the current ambiance, and the good food. We also had lovely service - they were pleasant and attentive.

Definitely worth a try!",1

trn_5681,Ate here other day and overall was not impressed. Ordered a cheese omelet with pancakes. It was overdone and kind of bland. Pancakes were just ok and they flaked so much I thi8nk they were a little undercooked. Tiny amount of syrup brought out I had to ask for more. For $8.95 it was a lot of food but honestly it was just mediocre.,-1
trn_5682,"Because I like to go for massages regularly, I generally go to my favorite cheap foot massage place, Best Foot Spa. Unfortunately, the city has decided to crack down on places like this so they are no longer allowed to work on your neck, head, shoulders, or back. I think consumers should be allowed to make that choice for themselves, but the government can do whatever they want and I understand why licensed massage therapists would have a problem with these less expensive places. 

That being said, I wanted to find somewhere affordable where I could continue with my weekly massage routine. Not only did Elements have last minute availability on a Sunday, but they had a special going on for two fifty-five minute massages for $99. The woman who booked my appointment on the phone was incredibly friendly, and she turned out to be the owner. When I got there she told me about all the upcoming specials going on, including one for July where after your first massage of the month you can get however many more you want for just $39. Awesome. Plus, I responded to their follow up email with a one question survey and got a certificate for a free upgrade to an 80-minute massage. It really seems like you get rewarded for coming often here.

Obviously none of this matters if the massage isn't good. Luckily it was great! Very firm pressure (they don't charge 'deep tissue' prices for this) and nice little extras like hot towel wraps and a chocolate on the pillow. I will still go to Best Foot Spa for a killer foot massage, however, because that was the only area that my massage at Elements was lacking in. 

Overall, I highly recommend Elements for both price, quality, and atmosphere.",1

As everything  is being served at once my waiter spills my margarita on my pants and sandal. Says sorry, runs away never to be seen again. Luckily anther server was near by to get a napkin to wipe myself off. Seriously. I complained maybe thinking the manager would come by, but only to hear the server is busy. Never going back, that's for sure. If my waiter was so busy the manager should be helping making sure everything runs smoothly. I'm sure the manager was standing there with his thumb up his ass.",-1

My first attempt was unsuccessful as I was told to call back because I called the wrong dept my 2nd attempt the call was answered and then quickly cut off, I called back about half a doz. times while driving there and never got through, I figured that because Best Buy was so busy that Future Shop was too and that's why I couldn't get anyone on the phone? Well was I wrong! The store was empty! Tons of sales reps standing around with nothing to do! I knew exactly what I wanted so my interaction with the sales guy was brief and un eventful but the extremely frustrating phone calls before hand left a sour taste in my mouth.

trn_5687,Had better.  Smallish salad bar.  Roast Beef was ok.  Chowder not tasty .  Snow Crab.  Ham good.  Ribs good.  It was ok.  Cherry  Pie good.  We had 2 for 1 coupons.,0
trn_5688,"Let's start with the beer, which was specially made for every college jock who has ever questioned, ""why doesn't my coffee stout actually taste like coffee?"" You're in luck young jock, their stout taste just like coffee. Their Albino Stout, just like diabetic toffee with light undertones of beer. The Jake tastes just like your gym friend Jake. And the other beers are on the menu which are described as ""drinkable"" are surprisingly drinkable because they lack character.

Any brewery can get their beer wrong, but their food on Yelp looked so right... and that's where it ended. I saw luscious photos of their salt pestatio and goat cheese beets, but the generous and oh so beautiful to look at amount of goat cheese was bitter and tasteless. Their scallops were topped with the fruity awfulness found in fruit cake. However, their bacon wrapped dates, topped with piquillo pepper sauce, get a B+ for creativity. These dates taste like and almost as good as a sausage so much so that it made me pause and admire at the flavor combination. 

I came on a Friday night so I don't mind the half-hearted service, but I really felt bad for the manager who served me a couple of my dishes. You could tell that she really cared about the place, but she was the only one.

I can't entirely blame the staff for being burnt out considering their customer base. This restaurant is a Dave and Buster's all American fun house which attempts to be so much more. It is pornography to the eyes, but, like cheap porn, it is truly unsatisfying. [Insert college jock joke here]. Perhaps this spot is so popular because, through aesthetics, it makes young adults feel good about being trendy.",-1
trn_5689,"After two visits to Metro Brasserie, I feel like I've experienced enough to write a review... 

My first visit was for the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE, (kudos to Metro for hosting and giving us a sampling of many of your fine French menu items).  We had fun that night... highlights in my eyes were the the Gin Fizz cocktail that Ty L ordered - he allowed many of us to sample it and it was delicious!  (I'm not even a gin drinker).  I also enjoyed the flatbread and fried oysters.  Great wine selection too!

After the UYE, a few of us stayed for dinner - while I really enjoyed the vegetable salad, the cod was not amazing (maybe it was the preparation with the leeks that I was not a fan of, but so be it - I know not to order that next time!)  I will say a major standout for all of us was the beignets - OMG!  Served warm with dipping sauce, these are a must order when you visit Metro!

I returned for brunch the following Sunday, and let me tell you - brunch is the way to go!  Between Jared and I, we had three menu items.  I went with the egg white omelette (served with mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and gruyere cheese) - I chose grits as my side and they were even better than the grits I remember eating when I lived in the South!  He had steak and eggs and the quiche.  We both cleaned our plates.  Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee also made appearances at our table.  Both were great, but a tip to Metro - I prefer my grapefruit juice without ice next time!

Jason was our server for brunch, Chad was our server for dinner, and GM Bill was friendly and helpful as always...  I like the shirts that the waiters wear - go check 'em out!  I know I'll be returning for brunch again real soon.  Maybe I'll see you there!",1
trn_5690,"Every year for our respective birthdays, Danny and I have to pick a restaurant for the other to treat us to. This year I wanted to try something new, and enlisted the help of Yelp and some friends to find the perfect place. After looking at menus and consulting all recommendations given by friends, I settled on Taverne Gaspar because it combines three things I love - food and beer in a pub atmosphere. I made reservations for a Friday night at 7pm, and were seated promptly upon arrival. This place finds itself in Old Montreal and is very quaint. It is minimalist and offers a laid-back feel. Our server, Eric, was super nice and was very knowledgeable on the specials and beer/food selection. Danny and I each started off with the beer dégustation (5oz each of a dark ale, cream ale, white ale and blonde ale), which ended up being the perfect choice as I had been undecided on what beer to choose. Being Oktoberfest, we were suggested fresh pretzels as appetizers, which we both had. They were fresh and so good with the marinara sauce. For our actual meals, I had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries, and Danny had the Steak Frites. My burger was so tasty, flavourful and not so ginormous that I couldn't finish the rest of my meal. The BBQ sauce on it was just perfect, and the sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Danny enjoyed his steak and finished up my sweet potato fries as well (sign of a good meal!). At the end of the meal, I was surprised with a birthday dessert, a chocolate molten lava cake with fresh raspberries. It was the perfect end to a delicious meal. Definitely recommend others give it a try!",1

We were visiting family for Thanksgiving and with a family of 5 it can be a challenge finding a decent inexpensive hotel that allows 5 in a room.  The suite was perfect with 2 queen beds and a pull out couch in the other room.  A full size refrigerator, sink, coffee maker, 2 burners, microwave and toaster were in the kitchen area.  They had a basket filled with coffee, hot chocolate, and microwave popcorn.  My kids were in heaven.  The lobby always had lemon water, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and fruit.  On Thanksgiving when we came home from dinner there was also pumpkin and apple pie.  Often cookies or other treats were available in the lobby at no cost.  The breakfast is only lavish, not the standard cold cereal and waffle iron, but they had eggs, potatoes, meats, oatmeal, yogurts, fruits and tons of breads/pastries.  Not up to my standards of yumminess, but the kids loved it.  My husband had forgot his shaving cream, no problem they were happy to provide for him.  As we left for the day we were offered bottled water.  I would definitely come back again and recommend this hotel to friends and family!",1

As I approached the counter, my host graciously explained the process and helped me build a delicious box. They provided suggestions, but let me do my thing.  You pick your base, protein, veggies and toppings and sauce. There are just right number of choices: Enough to be able to change it up, but not so many as to overwhelm. The hosts were kind and seemed genuinely happy to be there, which is a nice change for a fast food joint. 

The food was fresh and healthy, and the portion was huge. I'm over 6ft and could barely finish my bowl. I'd love to see a regular and large option to reduce waste. All said and done,  I'm very happy to have stumbled into this new place. If you're in the area then you should definitely give it a go!

I recently purchased a new Bosch dishwasher from the Spencer. After I figured out which model I wanted, I contacted them via online to get a quote and Marcus responded to my inquiry on the same day.

He was persistent in following up with questions I had and set up a delivery and installation from their contractor. He was flexible when I had to change the delivery date, and he followed up by calling me on my cell, office phone and e-mail when I didn't respond to his message right away.

Delivery and installation didn't go accordingly however I appreciate the thorough work they did. They get paid per job, not by the hour, so naturally they want to do as many as possible but when things went wrong, they stayed as long as it took to get the job right. What I originally thought would take 30 mins, ended up being 3 hours. They were not happy but stayed clam the whole time (or at least in my presence).

I've eaten here on multiple occasions and have tried the pizza and the salads. Others I've been with have tried the bbq and the sandwiches. No one gave it a bad review. The pizza was deemed the best option as the slices are HUGE and the drink refills are free.

trn_5712,"Not So Good.

I really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review.  Especially when the reviews are really good.  So lets start off on a positive note.  The staff New Asian Kitchen are friendly and very accommodating.   The service is fast and the prices are reasonable.

However, The food just wasn't that good. The pork and  chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless. The  vegetables were overcooked and soggy. The egg roll was cooked nicely, but just didn't have a good flavor.  The same could be said about the won tons and crab puffs.   

I cannot  give New Asian Kitchen a good recommendation but in a pinch, you could do worse.",-1
trn_5713,"The first time I went to Carolina Sports Massage was right after running my first 50K and my muscles really needed to be flushed out. I was immediately amazed at Adrienne's knowledge and experience, as she was so familiar with the contours of every muscle that she knew exactly what to look for. With my volume of running, she suggested going back at least once if not twice per month, and following that advice has helped me stay injury free, and has improved my running tremendously. Whether you run, bike, lift weights, or do any athletic activity whatsoever, I would highly recommend this place! In fact, I've already sent many people to Carolina Sports Massage, and most of them have become repeat customers like me!",1

I have to say the Fry's on Indian School is way over due for an internal remodel  of the  whole store. The bathrooms are not ones to use unless you do not mind using a dirty, very lightly cleaned bathroom. The produce is  overpriced compared to Sunflower's that is right up the road and less than 1/2 mile. The customer service desk staff has always been a bit grouchy or rude but I go to purchase money orders and they are 50 cents a piece so I go to  Fry's rather than my bank for these. They have some staff that has worked there for years and is friendly to customers. You can run into weirdo's there like one other poster I noticed exclaimed but you will run into some crazy people just about anywhere nowadays.",0

We waited 20 minutes (beyond reservation time) for a table. The service was fair.  My only specific complaint is that she brought the bill while I was eating (I'm slow).  The food was pretty good, overpriced, and definitely under-presented.  My friend had the ravioli... which was a plain bowl of pasta with sauce.  Another friend had the Franco salad, which seemed kinda busy.  I had the stuffed trout, which was very tasty, but (again) under presented.  Cafeteria plate.  No garnish.  Fish+stuffing.  The green beans were tasty because of the tbs of butter they were placed in.  All in all, it was ok, but over billed.  The restaurant is dated (70's chic?), the service was meh.  I didn't hate it, but everything was kinda 5/10- except the boss lady, who seemed to work her butt off.",-1

Best tater tots.  In fact the tater tots were the driving force of picking the club for the meal.  So glad I made the right choice.

Zack gave good service and my glass of Rose' rounded out the meal.

I at first gave the store the benefit of doubt because it was new but now that the store has been around for several months this still applies especially with meat and poultry.

trn_5736,"WOW, simply put, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I had the pan seared salmon.  The salmon itself was excellent, very juicy and perfectly seared.  But the surprising part was the garnishes... there was some kind of garlic butter spinach on top, and the plate was lined with a pesto sauce (can't remember what kind).  The tastiest part of the meal, however, (besides the salmon) was the creamed white corn that the salmon rested upon.  I've never liked creamed corn (from the can) but this was VERY good.  It had the consistency of Cream of Wheat, and not the nasty, slimy creamed corn you used to eat as a kid.

Great, great food... I will definitely go back, I'd like to try one of their steaks next time I go.",1

trn_5748,"Okay.. of all the doctor's offices I've visted (four, soon to be five as of tomorrow) in the last month, this one is the worst. I got a referral from my Nurse Practitioner to come here before seeing a surgeon for my problems. I don't know why, but it didn't dawn on me that all they were going to do here was give me more prescriptions (of which I do NOT want) and send me on my way. 

First, they're Suite ""D"" 102, but over the phone I was just told ""102."" It wouldn't have been an issue if, just a few doors down, there wasn't another ""102,"" apparently with an ""E"" in front of it I didn't notice. I walked into the wrong office and tried to sign in and then was redirected to the correct office (strike one). Once inside the correct office, there was a walk in who was being treated as if he were the scum of the Earth for having walked in hoping to see someone for his pain (not that this was an incredibly busy day with just him, myself, and two other patients waiting around -- strike two). Then, when I finally got to sign in, the girl closed the window on me as I was about to tell her I'm a new patient and proceeded to put on an earpiece to answer phones with. After about three minutes, she finally noticed me and asked me what I wanted. I told her I was a new patient and then she cut me off midsentence when I was about to ask if there were forms I needed to fill out (because of going to the wrong suite and the walk in, I was now five minutes late -- strike three for her rudeness). Her exact words were, ""I'll call you when I'm ready for you.""

I was about to walk out when I heard her and another girl who was just sitting there playing with her hair smirking and making comments about the walk-in who was having a shitty time getting them to help him. Too bad I had an appointment and they would probably charge me for a visit if I left. Anyways, I went  back and the girl taking my blood pressure was asking me questions about why I was there and what problems I'd been having. This bothers me really bad and has happened twice at my Nurse Practitioner's office as well; you don't get a person talking while they're getting their blood pressure done. My mom, who's a nurse(!), has always said this can give an inaccurate read -- sure enough, it did! 

By this point, I was just ready to see the doctor and hoped he'd be at least better than the people he employed. I'll admit, he was better, but not by much. He was half friendly/half unwilling to listen to everything I'd been through (9 months of backpain only to find out I have a herniated disc and a buldging disc). He glanced over my CAT scan results faxed over to him, said I was too young to have this problem, offered me epidural injections (no, thanks) and more medications, said there was nothing he could do beyond that, and sent me on my way. 

Upon checking out, I was supposed to be scheduled for another appointment with him in two months. The girl at the desk (one of the oh so charming ladies from earlier) scheduled me with their nurse practioner. Then, just as I was about to walk out, the one who had been playing with her hair at the front desk said she'd need a urine sample from me. Did she ever say why? Of course not. It all just seemed very strange and I left feeling unhelped and uncomfortable.

So much for a pain ""specialist."" My dad (who, like my mom, is in the medical field) was right when he called these people ""for crackheads."" Unless you want drugs and to be treated badly (maybe being high on vicodin blurs their rudeness to some patients), avoid this location if you've got options to go elsewhere.",-1

I gave Littlefish 4/5 because I really enjoyed their french toast with blueberries.  It was my first time going here and I had heard that they have pretty good buttermilk pancakes, but I had already had pancakes the day before. I ended up choosing the French toast with eggs and bacon, while my friend got their special scrambled Eggs and pancakes.   I have to be honest, I haven't had French toast in ages, but from what my taste buds can recall, this was really good and my friend agreed!  We were actually surprised that they aren't known for their French toast. 
The pancakes were fine. They tasted good but nothing extraordinary.  But that wasn't where they lost points. They lost points for their coffee. I am sorry, but it wasn't the greatest. It was a little too bitter and no amount of milk, cream or sugar could improve it's flavour.

Inside the lobby is a bar and then also a restaurant.  The hours are a little sketchy for the restaurant, so be sure you call before showing up if you aren't staying there.

trn_5766,"This is a great place to purchase a freshly made burger and a traditional malt or shake.

Ambience: Very clean and personal touch with escorted seating. They also use real flatware instead of plastic, big time plus. Paper towel rolls instead napkins makes for easy clean-up and those people that love to ask for extra napkins. Overall a nice blend of happy days diner meet modern world. One large television is mounted upon the wall however; was not turned on ( great because once I had my lunch companion put the cell phone down we were able to have a great conversation.) This is the perfect place with a moderate crowd to grab an upscale burger without an upscale price.

Food: The burger was very tasty and reminded me of the perfect cheese burger that I ate while I was in Japan. The ""best of both"" was tasty however the onion rings were cut so thin that they reminded me of string fries in a bad way (-). The smallest burger that I would suggest is the semi-serious (highlighted on the menu) as the $1 difference is a noticeable upgrade. I had a hard time finding my classic burger underneath the bun. The picture displayed is the semi-serious burger. The hamburger buns are toasted with butter and made me smile while I jumped up and down. Fountain soda had a good mix and I guess that the price is okay since you get a free re-fill. Other items on the menu wings, shakes, malts, and salads were not sampled. Good nitch as they stayed true to the product ""cheese burgers"". Fair warning $$ and the burger free toppings have a great selection from lettuce to tomatoes however; the premium toppings such as bacon (.99) and mushrooms(.99) cost extra. My bill was approximately $24 for 2 burgers (classic w/free toppings and the semi w/bacon and mushrooms), 1 medium onion ring and french fry combo (able to split between us), 1 fountain drink with free refill, and one glass of water with refill, ouch.

Customer Service was great with frequent inquiries from all of the floor servers ""great concept and job"" (+). Bill was not presented until requested (+) gave me  time to think about other menu items and enjoy the personal service (the reason that you go to have a sit down meal).

trn_5782,"Stayed here for two nights over the weekend and was greatly disappointed. Yes the suites are big but that's all this place has going for it. I tried ordering room service and I wasn't allowed to charge it to the room even though I had a credit card on file. Maybe because I booked through expedia? I wasn't given a clear reason why but this seemed like a basic request. I tried calling the front desk and was put on hold for a few minutes so just gave up. I had a question a few days later on my bill and was put on hold again. When I got on the line the rep was speaking to a coworker and didn't realize she was live, heard her coworker say ""hey, I think your on"" and then got hung up on and had to go through the whole process of waiting to talk to someone again. I prefer the service at the bellagio and will just deal with a smaller room.",-1
trn_5783,I love Five Guys. First time to this location and was disappointed on the large fries portion. You use to get an extra scope of fries at the bottom of the bag but I guess they don't do that anymore. You set that expectation so needless to say we were disappointed and so were other patrons as we heard their comments as well.,0

IT is a good place to live as long as you don't have maintenance issues, the quality of the work is not good.  Most things were better off before they came it to repair them.  Grounds crew could care less, blow your door mat away and you have to go looking for it, knock down patio furniture even broken my, and I have had to replace my car window three times because they blow stuff on my car including rocks, reported it to the office 7 to 8 times but still happens. They call it a gated community but the gates are always broken takes weeks and months to be repaired so don't move here thinking it is a safe gated community as it is not.  Doubt I will renew my lease. Office staff tries to get you to do their work and are rude when you try to explain something to them.",-1

You must go there if you get a chance. Brad,1
trn_5791,"Valentino's is a convenient place to get some satisfying pizza, pasta, or sandwich on the go! I've tried the pizza here once, but the last couple times I've been here I've gotten the chicken parmesan sandwich. When I had gotten pizza, I ordered a small pizza with chicken as a topping, which cost about $10. I personally thought the pizza was not bad - nothing amazingly special, but satisfying for when you're craving pizza and also a pretty filling meal for the price you pay. The chicken parmesan sandwich is pretty tasty and satisfying, and I do enjoy ordering this on the go but it is not that big of a sandwich. They do also have a dinner combo with the sandwiches/pastas that includes salad and bread, which I imagine is more of a complete meal and would be more filling. 

It does take some time for them to prepare your food here, so do expect a little bit of a wait when you order here. I don't have any complaints about my experiences with the staff here though. Overall, Valentino's is definitely a convenient place to stop by for some satisfying food on the go!",1

Their Chicken Quesadilla is amazing as well - loaded with cheese, seasoned chicken, onions, cilantro, and some other good stuff that I'm forgetting, and topped with sour cream and guacamole. 

I've been here a dozen or so times with coworkers and the service is always very friendly. 

Oh, and you get to fill up on chips and homemade salsa while you wait for your food to come out. Om nom nom.",1
trn_5794,"BEST DEAL IN TOWN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS - 5PM TO 1AM!!!!  Half-off just about the entire menu, it's the only time I've ever been, but it is enough to keep me coming back.  So very worth it . . . . even if you have to wait . . . I think I've subconsciously held off on this review because I didn't want people to discover it's goodness and grow the lines!! 

It's not a very big place, in fact, it's one of the smaller ones I frequent.  There is sushi bar seating as well.  Service is not stellar, but it isn't bad either.  They are pretty quick and they do get it right, but they're not over-friendly.  But that's ok cuz I'm there for the sushi! :) 

The sushi is delicious -- the fish is amazingly fresh and the selection of food -- rolls, sashimi, nigiri, non-sushi items, desserts is tops!!  There are no restrictions (or very, very few if at all) -- no one oyster or umi order, at least not yet.  Biggest bummer is NO NATTO.  Beer is also half off -- yes, the large bottle of Kirin Light for $4. No kidding.  Mochi ice cream is half off too and my girls order 3 a piece!

My all time favorite roll is the Kobe 2 . . . it is fresh and melts in your mouth!  Oceans 12 is also amaaaaaazing!!  There's many to choose from and most are premium rolls with a ton of freshness, not imitation crab and crab mix filling.  

Give it a try -- it's a top 3 on my list for sushi (especially on Friday and Saturday Happy Hour Nights)!!",1

Oh heaven, jars of ginger, nice sized jars of ginger...already winning points and causing me to make a mental note to myself:  must bring hubbie.  He hates having to always ask for more ginger.  Now if they would do the same w/ the wasabi......

Lots of nice choices.  Liked the squid salad, something different.  Not sure why the salads (cucumber, seaweed) are running more than the standard sushi plate, unless they are pricing it up on volume??  They have some fruit and dessert options going round on the belt.  They even had inari, my idea of Japanese dessert.  

Overall sushi quality is average and enjoyable to snack on.  The prices make this place a 'must return' and do so often.  Friends made-to-order salmon handroll was $1?!?!?!",0

I highly recommend the Rusty El Camino margarita, but be careful if you're driving because it's a deliciously strong one! 

Let's be real, you can go to RuRu's tacos and tequila but not get free chips and salsa and pay the same amount for a margarita that's half the size of Paco's. By far, best Tex-Mex the the CLT, and yes I've tried quite a few places.",1

trn_5799,"Brilliant Bridal's business model works with me! I appreciate the lower prices they can offer their customers. For brides on a budget, it's worth popping into this salon. I wanted something under $400 and the choices were endless, unlike other salons where I would only be limited to glorified bridesmaids' dresses. Although I was shopping for a more minimalistic gown, they have plenty with the bling, poof, lace and twinkle most look for. 

Not only will you find gowns for half the price of normal stores but since it seems they carry discontinued or overstock styles, you can find something unique. This was my case and I'm in love with my dress - vintage, romantic and truly unconventional.",1

I was really impressed by his enthusiasm and his great hospitality. He knew the menu really well and made good suggestions to not only us but also to the people around us. We were going to order 3 full dishes but he suggested that instead of ordering the 3rd full dish, we could order it as a side (small portion and cheaper).

trn_5809,"One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.

My wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.

*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. 

The staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It's what I expect.

The quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.

There may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat.",1

Even the chair in my room was dog eared and the only new thing was the TV.  

I will add that they have a tennis court, pool area with a slide and a large courtyard for people to enjoy the hot AZ sun.

I will say that the beds are to die for!!!  It was like jumping into a cloud so that's why I gave them three stars since I REALLY was unimpressed with the room.  Considering how much the room a night is you could at least get free wifi AND a room that has basic nice furniture!  

I would expect better rooms from a Sheraton",0

I had the tuna poke salad app, very delicious and delicately prepared, flavourful and a perfectly developed app. Had the goat cheese and roasted red pepper sandwiching with a Caesar salad, a great light option for dinner. Would recommend this place more for their beer selection. Place is open late and great option before heading out to a show or to the movies.

At one point, there were some significant challenges with my mother's caregiver. However, companies should be judged by the way they address problems - how they turn a bad situation into a good long-term outcome. 
Once Cerna realized there was a substantial problem, they addressed the situation quickly, decisively, appropriately and completely.

Yeah, I want myself or my family to slice our foot open in the shower so we can spend our time limping around with stitches.  There were numerous details that were missed, no pride in craftsmanship throughout.  Management is obviously not held accountable for quality.  They need to go through the rooms and punch list their rooms.  Misaligned faucets, crooked wall hangings, a makeup light tied to the bathroom light switch so you can't have a night light to assist aim on a middle of the night pee instead you have to turn on the bright bathroom light and burn in your retina.  We left our first nights room service in the hall the next day and a piece of plastic wrap was left on the ground, it was still there the day we left.  Little things add up.  At least we had a nice view of a wall and a pigeon.  I use to hold the Westin chain in such high regard but after a couple big fumbles like moldy caulking in bath tubs, visible mildew in the AC etc in their other hotels I'm very disappointed.

Well, let's start with, I didn't even get the chance to walk up the steps before I  was greeted by Claudia
That was a great start to my experience.  As I am a creature of habit I always order the grilled chicken sandwich, add bacon minus onion.

The car was unsafe to drive, each time I went back, Discount tried to up sell me or told me my car was driving perfectly normal. They finally agreed to throw another set on, fixing all issues.

trn_5830,"I phoned around to various plumbers and received varying quotes but Aaron & Son gave me the best quote of $360-$450 + materials for the work I needed done, which was the installation of kitchen taps and bathroom taps on the main floor, and the removal and installation of the vanity and taps in the basement bathroom. They came in and did the work in 2.5hrs and did a great job, then handed me a bill for just under $900 ($167 for materials). When questioning the price I was told that they were not informed of the installation of the taps in the main floor bathroom (which took only 20min to install). I disagreed because I went over in detail the work I needed done 3 time so there was no misunderstanding and the man I was speaking with confirms the job requirements back to me. I find it very misleading, actually down right deceitful to quote something and turn around and gouge people after the work is done. Also they didn't even end up removing the vanity and taps downstair, I found out after they left that my 80 yr old father removed them but they still charged for it.

So basically they do a great job but be ready for a costly shock when you get the bill.

Oh yeah, keep in mind they charge $89/hr travel fee to travel to your home. No one I know gets paid to travel to work, why should they be any different.",-1

I've tried a  few other things there  the coconut cupcake, eh bought 2 ended up throwing one away again very dry and not fresh tasting.

The lobby and casino floor doesn't seem too bad, but not so much the elevators...to get to my room I would need to use the South Tower Elevator. It takes a REALLY long time...can't stress that enough. BUT I have been tipped off by an employee here that I could use their Service Elevator which is a bit quicker. But I've heard that to fix the elevators it would cost some million dollars... Then I entered my room...wasn't impressed especially because the chairs, blankets, table, even TV were very outdated. Don't know if its because they want to keep the feel of the old Vegas or they don't care to modernize just a little bit (at least the blankets).

Meat, appetizers (the vegetarian appetizers) and the kunefe and the rice pudding were all very good. The kazandibi was just OK - not the real thing. 
However at two different times, the main Veg. dishes were very poorly cooked. One the mixed veggie (guvec) had the veggies still raw (egpplant needs to be cooked thoroughly in Turkish cousine). Another time, we tried the okra, and the whole dish was bad. The onions were chopped very large, and still raw, as was all the other veggies (tomatoes, okras). Clearly, those dishes were cooked by someone who had no clue about Turkish cooking.
Service: So so. The menu said (as another review here) the sigara borek came with the coban salad. When we asked, our waitress dismissed us: no it does not come together you need to order separately. She seemed grumpy.

We went back for the kunefe, though. Hence the 4 stars.",1

trn_5844,"Good stuff but I am a local so I am a bit bias about my food and places.  I will not be back for food (dinner) it was good but I can get the same for cheaper in a local spot.  I think if you are a tourist it is totally worth it for the cool ambiance the lighting is sparkly  and fun, the restaurant is dimly lit anding to all the glittering lights and trees surrounding you.  Big oval booths add to the fun 70's 80's ish feel.  

I had a huge burger Ciabatta Pesto Burger Flame-broiled burger could taste the flame in the food.  Mozzarella cheese, fresh basil instead of lettuce a nice touch, red onions some were hard and not good so I had to pick them off, tomato, Prosciutto (prosciutto was old and hard had to pick that off as well) and pesto (lots almost to much pesto) sauce on a ciabatta the bun was awesome.  All burgers come with the choice of french fries, onion rings or potato salad (I had onion rings pretty awesome as far as onion rings go ;)

I do think however I would come back for some late night drinks in the bar area they are really cool looking and the setting, fire pits and appetizers are pretty good I hear!  That is why they are getting 3 stars instead of 2 because the ambiance and bar is I think the highlight of any locals trip!  I wish my food would have all been fresh and I wouldn't of had to pick so much off I would have liked to have added a star to my review.",0

trn_5846,"The experience is really what you pay for! 

Pros: 
Our server Willy! Definitely had a great sense of humor and exquisite customer service.

The dark (you have to feel for your food and guess what you're eating and it's fun to speak to people around you!)

THE DESSERT 

Servers wear night vision goggles (HOW COOL)

Cons: 

7 courses takes too long, and it can get slightly anxiety inducing just sitting there waiting.

The margarita - tasted like it was made with margarita mix. Way too sweet. 

The food...I wanted to try flavorful and exciting dishes. Things tasted a little ambiguous? Just veggies with sauce. Some zucchini cut with a spiraled to make it feel like pasta?? Why? I'll have some pasta

Nonetheless I had a great time. Eating in the dark is quite fun when you're not worried about how you look when you eat lol",0
trn_5847,"Yo, I never have complaints with no body no how, but I went into this little ceasers last night. I know they were about five min from close, i asked for. Peproni pizza. Some curly headed Richard face told me they couldnt becuase it was too close to close. First of all i work in food. That doesn't matter. Second I let that go because I clear wasn't gunna get my delicious extra peproni, wings, and Italian cheese bread. So i just took the boring ass plain cheese and stale bread sticks. Then I try to pay with a gift card, my mother brought it for me, so I knkw it has money on it. I mean its my mother a sweet old lady, but anyways it wasnt working in the card reader said it was an error. I asked him to enter it manualy, this mother freaker told me there was no way possible to do that and walked away.

The only way you could improve is as I suggested. 

1. Service
2. Seats that can support a child ( bare minimum ).
3. Try a light brine with your chickens, ""dryness"".
4. Just make your sides buffet style, because they won't improve.

P.S. I won't be back... you're lucky you don't have a lawsuit!, My little boy received a decent sized bump on his head and I am sure a nice headache to sleep off that night. 
You can improve such as I have stated,  and by spelling my name right, and using better English grammar or that may be why your seats break in the first place... low attention to detail.  I sir have a very HIGH tolerance to many things but, when my siblings get hurt EVERY poor details comes to light.
Just let old dogs lay, take your licks, and count your blessings.

Old review:

First time there chicken for both me and my wife was dry... Sides were fruit salad and limp cucumber salad could have made it better at home for less.

Second time back we gave it a second chance this did not happen however, we waited behind some happy people trying to figure out what to order for over 10 minutes while the line behind us backed up.

We finally had our chance to order after noticing 2  people coming up asking where there lunches were.

We took our table it was me, my wife and my 2 year old son...my son feel through the seat down to the floor while I in shock I quickly pulled him out while he began to cry turned to the front counter girl and demanded a full refund ($28 ) and left, I will never be back. They let people sit in broken seats? I doubt there chicken has improved they could improve there service by making the sides ALL buffet style as they are CHEAPLY MADE anyway.",-1

This week we were suppose to receive our bi-weekly clean at 10:00 on Tuesday.  The maids show up at 11:30ish and had no clue they were suppose to be here at 10. So I asked to reschedule for the following day and they were booked up (okay that's fine) so then they say they will come on Thursday.  Well 10 rolls around then 11 and still no maids.  We had to contact the owner and he said one of the maids was fired ""due to her personal issues"" okay that's fine but let people paying you know.  So they FINALLY come on Saturday they ""clean"" the house in about 1.5 hours (it's about 2000 square feet) so they do an average job.  The cleaning was suppose to be free- well we were then charged.

trn_5851,"My husband and I came by here two Thursdays ago for lunch. I had this place bookmarked for a little over year and have always wanted to come and glad that I finally did.

Anyways, when we arrived, I didn't really know what to expect. From the outside, this place looked a little sketchy. The sign has graffiti on it and the little strip mall this is located in just seemed kind of small and not in the best of neighborhoods. Anyways, when we walked in, we were acknowledged by a server and she told us to pick a table to sit down. When we sat down, we were given 2 cups of water and a closed styrofoam container. Wasn't too sure what that styrofoam container was for and thought our server accidentally put it on our table and that she boxed up someone's leftovers at another table.

Inside the styrofoam container is cold boiled peanuts so we started eating that as we were deciding what to order. Our server came by pretty quickly and we ended up ordering:

2 orders of Bibimbap in a stone pot- delicious! Just as good as any other place I have had bibimbap. Loved the crunchy rice as well (the benefits of ordering this in a stone pot/ bowl). 

Chicken Musubi- Delicious! I didn't know musubi could be made with chicken since I have always seen it only with spam. The only thing is that the chicken was a bit oily, but that's expected at a down home place like this.

Spam Musubi- I didn't get a bite of this but my husband liked it. The size for this musubi and the chicken one was a pretty big piece. 

Our meal was also rounded out with some banchan. We got 4 little plates and my favorite was this one with broccoli. One man, whom I suspect is one of the owners (or maybe the manager) refilled our banchan throughout our meal. Our server was great at refilling our water. This other guy (I guess you can call him a server to?) also refilled our water and was really friendly. Service was very attentive, quick and very friendly. I will definitely come back here again the next time I am in the area. Oh and real random, this place has fast (ask for the password) wifi.",1

It was filthy and as soon as I went to seat down I got my hands and clothes dirty from sauce left on the seat probably  from people that was there before. Not that the place was busy and for sure they would have enough time to clean up after people's mess. The host did not care and I had to dig my purse to find something to clean up myself. I tried to seat somewhere else and realize this whole place were dirty. I didn't want to take any chances to eat there and I left with my family.

trn_5855,"Time for an update.  I will say we had no problems with this company when renting, paying our rent, and living peacefully with no contact as we had no problems with the rental property.  However, this company is very shady.

We knew our lease was expiring at the end of April, and had a feeling they would go up on rent as they always do each year.  Luckily we were smart and decided to look for a new place early on in the event the rent did go up.  

This is where the shady part comes in.  You have to give Talley a 30 day notice (March 31 for us) your intention of how you would like to continue your lease by either extending another year (at a higher rate) or extending month to month (yet an even higher rate).  Or you have to give Talley a 45 day notice if you intend to vacate (March 16 for us (a weekend date which they are not open)).  They did not send us the letter of their intention on how or if they were going to increase the rate until the week of March 10, so we actually did not receive it in the mail until Wednesday, March 12.  So if you wanted to move out, whether you could afford the new rate or just did not want to pay their new rate (later for us), you had 2 days to make a decision.  Like I said, since it is their thing to increase rent each time, we were ahead of the ball and knew if they increased, we would leave.  If they expect renters to give them proper notice, they should be a good company and give us proper notice to make our decision.

We left and now the property is listed for rent at the price we were paying (so they couldn't give us that price as good tenants, instead they would rather let it sit and wait to be rented), they could have had us for another year, plus.  The only positive I can say from this is that we moved out and received our deposit back in a timely manner.  

Out of all the rental properties and companies I have dealt with, Talley is my least favorite and I would steer clear from them.",-1

In fact, the whole time I was there I told her I could not afford more then $200.00 and she assured me that $170.67 is all I would be charge. Every question I asked she lied about costing me an additional $245.75. She lied about what would happen if I returned the car early and the amount of the rental.

The most disrespectful, arrogant customer I have every seen. Belittling a waitress for not speaking French to his caliber, calling her names and asking for his order to be remade. When she came back with his new pizza he kept up the complaints. She left crying, when the owner came to see him he handled the situation like a pro, as the client kept up his banter the owner stated that he has re-made his order 3 times, compensated him; but once he was done, if he would please not come back to his establishment.
It was refreshing to see an owner stand up for his employees. He also personally came to apologize to my sister and I for the disruption.

It was a rare occasion that I happened to have a Tuesday off, so some friends and I decided to have lunch here. We ordered a large salad and a large pizza, half Honolulu and half Sunspot. They also brought warm bread and butter to the table. It was more than enough food for 3 people. The pizza was good, but sadly it was a little watery and soggy. The Honolulu comes with ham, pineapple, bacon and green pepper, and the Sunspot had chicken, artichoke, tomatoes, basil and garlic. You would think with alllll of those toppings that they would have made the pizza a little bit more well done. Nothing is more unappetizing than a pizza that is watery.

trn_5868,"I have been here for dim sum twice and the first time I went around 1pm so there was a wait for about 15 minutes which was fairly decent. We got seated and ordered our food. The positive is everything on the menu is $2.08 and there is an additional menu with noodles and rice that is priced more expensive but is available until 4pm (different from the regular dinner and takeout menu).

The service was very rushed the first time I went because of the timing, food was fairly decent but nothing amazing about it. They screwed up getting water for us, we asked for 2 glasses of water and received one. So we asked for another glass of water and they gave us a glass of ice. So again, we had to ask them for water before they gave us our water.

The second time I went was today with my friend, around 3pm and there was no wait due to the timing. Service was very fast, we were seated immediately and the restaurant had around 3-5 tables full at this time. We received our food in a timely manner and we both decided this time around the food was a lot more fresh and tastier. I  would prefer to go at a later time if I can receive better service. The main reason why I like this time because you can choose the items you want instead of waiting around for the carts and never having what you want.

The sushi is mediocre at best. It's a conveyor belt style so you get what you pay for. I tried ordering off the menu some nigiri and clearly it wasnt fresh considering they served it to me about 30 seconds after I odered. When your order nigiri it comes in 2 pieces on the same plate (priced on the menu as 2 pieces) but they serve you an empty plate under the sushi place which establishes you had two pieces of nigiri. Not understanding why they served me and extra plate under the nigiri I put it aside. They charged me for the 2 pieces of nigiri and they extra empty plate. When I asked why I was double charged they said they only charge the top plate. This was very confusing and not worth arguing the extra 3 dollars. In the end there are way better sushi places. I recommend seskan, sushi & cocktails, ahi revolving sushi, and ninja sushi. Cheers! Happy eating!",-1

I can seriously just chill out at their back patio every time when I am in Pickering with a pint of beer or a glass of wine!

Port has one of the nicest set up to enjoy the beautiful view of Lake Ontario. It is just hard to believe sometimes you can just enjoy this resort like setting right in your own town without going down south!

The food though decent but might be a little pricey which is more in line with Downtown Toronto's prices. A $19 Cheeseburger probably a little too rich for me for lunch!

trn_5879,"The Dowd has great facilities, large locker rooms complete with Steam and Sauna facilities, every fitness class you can think of, basketball courts, a pool...

It's the ideal place to go to stay fit.

The one drawback is that it's not without some sketchy activity.  Recently, I was changing after a workout, and I saw these two guys walking around the locker room.  I didn't think much of it, but someone who was changing beside me said,
""Hey - what are you two doing?""
""Nothin man, we're waitin for ****""
""I see you casin' the place, I left for a shower you were walkin around, I get back from my shower, you still walkin around""
""No man, we're just waitin for ****""

So the guy who is calling these two sketchy dudes out walks over to the emergency phone, picks it up and calls the front desk.

The two sketchy dudes, are acting all tough and cool about it, but literally proceed to walk out of the locker room, up the stairs and out of the building.  

I happened to finish up around that same time, and walked out about a minute after them.  I saw them get into their car and drive off - so much for waiting for their ""friend""!

As I'm watching them leave, another guy who left at the same time as me and was headed home or to work or something says to me,

""I can't believe it - they were definitely here looking to get into people's lockers""
""Yea, definitely, I'm surprised"", I reply
The guy says to me ""I actually had my locker broken into here not too long ago, my wallet was stolen...""

The moral of the story is this - either bring a freakin masterlock with you, or don't change at the gym and just enjoy the facilities!

trn_5881,"If it wasn't for the cool speakeasy style restaurant this would be a 1 star for the value. 

Location and Parking: Great location. Away from the busy streets of old town and mill but close enough to venture there before or after. Plenty of parking.

Style: This restaurant has a classy speakeasy feel but casual attire is fine. The restaurant is open until 12am and the bar open until 1am. It's hard to find someone serving ""upscale"" food  past 10pm so we were excited to check this place out.

Now for the very unfortunate part.

The food: Wow, just the worst value ever. We ordered Shrimp Cocktail, 2 glasses of champagne, market bay scallops and lobster stuffed shrimp. 

First we got the bread and champagne. Everything was going great. The bread came in huge slices and was fresh. It didn't come out warm but it was still fresh and tasty. It was served with a whipped butter. I prefer oil myself but it was good. The champagne was great.

Then we got our shrimp. It had that refrigerator taste to it. Like it was made earlier in the day and then wrapped in plastic and thrown in the fridge. We could both taste it. It wasn't the worst shrimp ever and we did eat all 5 jumbo shrimp but we were a little turned off already. 

Then we got our salad. We got the house vinaigrette as a dressing. Salad was fine. Lettuce was fresh. It was presented poorly though. I'm not usually a stickler on presentation but if you're charging $40-50 a plate I figured some effort was coming. It looked like a diner salad and for some reason they give you a huge heap of mushrooms on the side. Whatever, salad is a salad. We were still optimistic about this place. It was so cool and classy and close to home that we wanted to love it. Still no real complaints.

Then the dinner came. Ew man. Ew. My Scallops were flavorless. I was expecting big scallops seared and delicious. Instead, I got these miniature flavorless scallops served with a side of broccoli covered in some type of sour cream sauce. And this weird seasoned lemon as a garnish. The presentation was horrendous. It looked like a dish you get from a Mexican restaurant. As soon as we were served we gave each other that, ""what the hell is this"" look.

Her dinner was just as bad. Her stuffed shrimp had shells in it. She literally took one bite and didn't want to eat anymore. I tried to eat a few more pieces of the scallops but it was not good. The sides were even worse.

We had a party of 7...while I think that is a reasonable group the front hostess acted put out and was throwing menus like she hated her job. When we got our food I got the brisket trash can nachos which had stale chips...wife got a flat iron stake, which she told the waiter dairy free and med well done.... the stake was very well done to the point of jerky, and everything was coated in butter and oil... wtf. Father in law got some smoked chicken skewers, they tasted dried out like they sat under warmer last 3 hours... overall our table after drinks probably dropped $400... not going back ever... if you want good food hell hit up gillys by treasure island... for 7 you will spend half that and get way better food.",-1
trn_5886,"I would like to tbank those who leave reviews for business. Reading the reviews made my decision making a lot eaiser. When you arrive don't be discouraged. The horses were calm, friendly. The ride was slow and steady and the view was priceless. When/If I go back, I must do again",1
trn_5887,$148 dinner at Guy Fiori's good food  but then I was trapped 93 minutes to get out of the parking garage because the Linq charging people to park?  There is only one way out there and one way to pay for the entire garage. And then they are charging people more money because they've been waiting for 90 minutes to get out after they have pre-paid!  I will never come back here again I will never be back to Guy Fiori's ever again! If it takes 90 minutes to get out of your garage you should not have the audacity to charge people! However if you're not staying in the bedbug infested Linq hotel and can walk to this restaurant go check it out it's pretty good and ask for Christopher he is the best waiter!,-1
trn_5888,"The meat jun is a solid four stars. The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.  

Service can be better, but the lady has all tables to herself.  I guess someone called in sick today?  It's a fairly cheap meal for Korean food.  

Long story short, come for the meat jun and that's it.",0
trn_5889,Great food and fun atmosphere! The loud Italian workers crack me up. The whole experience feels authentic. Reasonable prices too.,1
trn_5890,"One of the best in town. My family and I love this place! Awesome environment, we love to sit outside on the patio. My 3 year old LOVES the pho and so do I. The shrimp spring rolls are also amazing. Everyone is so friendly and makes it a even more enjoyable time.",1
trn_5891,"I don't write reviews unless the business is either outstanding or awful; in this case, cafe Monarch was superb and deserves a review.  The location is now across the street from the old one. While it kept the charms of the old place, it has a much more refined dining room and patio now.  The food is still excellent and so is the service; even the valet was uber accommodating.  The scallops and the cauliflower soup were my favorite dishes.  My husband thinks every dish had a lot of umami flavor.",1
trn_5892,I love coming here. The staff is friendly and they know me by now. I love their salad bar because it's fresh and I enjoy the variety. I get an iced coffee here pretty much every morning. I would rather get coffee here than Starbucks.,1
trn_5893,Me and my vife we had dinner at this location Very friendly atmosphere and a friendly staff Kat was serving to us with A big simile in her face.,1
trn_5894,"Caffe Demetre you had me at Nutella Ice Cream! 

Remember those days when your parents wouldn't let you skip eating your veggies and go straight to dessert? Well if you're ever in the mood to rebel against your parents head to Caffe Demetre where you can go straight to dessert... dessert heaven that is! 
 
This place has a dessert menu that would make any sugar junkies head spin. They have crepes, waffles, sundaes, cakes, pies, fancy coffees (iced and hot), so basically everything your inner child desires. My personal favourites are their waffles; freshly made Belgian waffles topped with ice cream and assorted toppings (everything from fruit to brownies). You can choose to have one of their pre-conceived combinations or you can feel free to design your own. The waffles themselves are crispy on the outside but beautifully fluffy inside. My personal favourite is their rusty pelican (nutella ice cream, chocolate sauce, and nuts) mmmm I want one now!
 
I've also had their sundaes which are HUGE too and also quite decadent. I believe they make their ice cream in house and they do have some intriguing flavours (my favourite is the nutella; I'm dying to go back and try the peanut butter). With their sundaes and crepes you can choose a pre-set combination or design your own. All their desserts will run you around $8-10 dollars and are well worth it as they are delicious and quite large. 

This particular location has a pretty large patio, and is quite bright and clean on the inside. You cannot beat the location (404 and 7), and this is a great place to go after dinner or simply if you are craving something sinfully sweet. Service has always been good at this location and I will definitely keep coming back!",1
trn_5895,Luv this place!  I come here every time I'm in Phoenix. Can never decide - everything is great!,1
trn_5896,"My husband purchased a wallet for me for Christmas and I took it back to exchange it for a different wallet. I was greeted by Alejandro, who could not have been nicer or more helpful. He was disappointed that they did not have any wallets left from the Christmas rush and encouraged me to wait a week and then call before I returned, which I did. I called first and spoke to someone who was also very nice and helpful and took the time to check wallet stock and told me they had the one I wanted. I went into the store and was greeted warmly again by Alejandro, who was happy to exchange my wallet. In addition to my wallet, I bought a Speedy 30 Bandouliere that day. The transaction went extremely well! He was so nice and helpful and packaged everything up (including my exchanged wallet) as though they were Christmas presents. He was so kind and so helpful. I have always been treated well in this store and have been in and had an Associate show me a bag and then left without it. They always seem friendly and helpful even if you do not end up buying something at the time. I do think Alejandro is wonderful and would encourage anyone to go into the store and ask for him to help you!",1
trn_5897,"This place is a AVOID AT ALL COST! I booked a car with theses guys and I show up and they would not rent the car to me. I had already prepaid ,  making me trying to arrange another rental and would not give me a reason is ridiculous! The manager, this guy named Riley Fairchild is completely unprofessional and should never be promoted unless he improves himself as a human being from the core. There is another associate named Peter, who refused to give me a last name, I guess he had something to hide. The guy was completely disrespectful to me and my wife from the start. The man has no business in customer service and should be relieved post haste. I want to give this dumb and dumber duo zero stars but yelp was too kind! Avoid!",-1
trn_5898,"Okay, this place is pretty much the perfect weekend breakfast spot. For those of us in college Saturday and Sunday mornings can be absolute Hell. Having to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table to get some breakfast/brunch isn't that uncommon and makes things even more unbearable. This place is NEVER crowded and you can always be seated promptly. The menu is so extensive that I guarantee they'll have something that's just right to cure that hangover. Prices are great and so is the food. It's kind of a hidden gem... Not too appealing from the outside but pretty nice on the interior. I wouldn't be surprised if word gets out and Theo's starts becoming popular quite soon...",1
trn_5899,"Most people would think a pub would be a bit stuffy and serve exclusively fried food, but Sir Ed's really breaks the mold!
Tucked behind the Harris Teeter in Park Road Shopping center, this place is really a treat! They have a very diverse menu that includes several vegetarian entrees. My personal favorite is the zucchini cake with ratatouille. It hits the spot and keeps you full without feeling ver indulgent. My friends usually order the ostrich meatloaf, but it is a bit much for me. 
The bar is always a hit, with surprising local beer choices on tap along with the usual suspects like Guinness.
Sir Ed's also sports a nice patio for mild days and a dart board in the back for play time.",1
trn_5900,"I have, rather *had* been a Progressive customer for many years.  6 Months ago my rates spiked 35%.  I called.  And called.  And called.  Always polite.  Tyring to find out what caused the dramatic rate increase.  After 35 years of a pristine driving record.  Putting a massive 3000 miles total on my car.  It is all there.

I know... stupid civilian me.   

I am not blind.  I had hoped for at least an educated explanation. 

I know, stupid me.  

See my rating for the opinion.  If I could place a lower rating I would.  It was not just facing disappointment, it was dealing with incompetance.  Not one customer service agent, out of would say 5, could have passed their GED.  Forget that... not one would engage, dial in, and go to bat.  I know... corporate scripts to read from.  I am not stupid.  Which is why I called repeatedly looking for just an explanation.  

Epic Fail.  Somewhere along the line someone could have grabbed the brass ring and helped.  Nawp.  

So I went with my mortgage company which in the past has been absolutely stellar, coming to our need after a total house fire and being absolutely top shelf.  I mention State Farm because I wish I had combined auto with home long before, having had a real person who will answer your needs matters, and we have had direct experience with State Farm and they were supreme... while Progressive, when I was just looking for simple answers to my question produced Epic Fail.  

Cute commercials.  Performance however.... words removed because I am a gentleman.  

Am bummed.  For about a minute.  Moving on.  And have a story to tell.",-1
trn_5901,"We stopped in here after eating at the noodle place next door. So glad we did! We ordered the strawberry latte, cookies and cream frappe and a fruit bread box. We loved them all! Honestly the Nutella/banana piece was my favorite but my boyfriend liked the strawberry one. My strawberry latte had the BEST whipped cream ever. So thick and creamy. I wish they used it for their bread boxes. That would've made it A+++ for me. Especially since the fruit bread box is $10. Overall we enjoyed everything and would come back again!",1
trn_5902,"Most recently I went to Cibo on a Friday night. The hostesses seemed a bit disorganized. We had to wait about 20 mins -30 mins for a table for 3, so we had a drink at bar. The bartender was helpful and attentive.

When we got seated upstairs there were a good amount of empty tables so that was a bit strange. Our server was friendly and got our bottle of wine from the bar sent up as the hostess said she couldn't bring it up with us. The atmosphere upstairs was nice, open and its perfect for a get together with friends.

The menu has many great Italian options we ordered the arancini, garganelli pasta and mushroom pizza. The server came back within 5 mins to tell us that they ran out of pizza dough!! We were super disappointed with that. So we ordered the cod and tuna instead. 

When the arancini came out the runner plopped it on the table said ""meatballs"" and walked away lol. They tasted delicious (best in the city) and they were not meatballs. The garganelli pasta came out great, I would definitely order it again, my friends were happy with the tuna and cod as well.

For dessert we had the Dark Chocolate torta which was good. It wasn't too sweet which I liked but I would probably go for something else next time. It didn't wow me, we didn't even finish it (unusual for dessert).

The wine and conversation flowed all night.
 
If it wasn't for the mediocre service and the fact that they ran out of pizza dough on a Friday night (Big thumbs down!). I would really rate Cibo higher than a 3 star. I've had good experiences here in the past and I really like their enclosed patio in the summer and happy hour specials.",0
trn_5903,"Was able to get in for a last minute gender check and Terry was FABULOUS! She talked me through the whole ultrasound and revealed we are having a baby girl! This is less expensive than other gender checks ($45 vs $55 for base and the $45 included a 3D look, other places charge an extra $20 for that service) and there are a few trade off's (the room its self is not as nice as I have seen at other places and you don't get to pick your background music for the video...but if those things are not as important to you (they aren't to me) then this is your place!!",1
trn_5904,"Another yelp success! It's about 12 minutes away from the strip. We ordered everything that was recommended to us - curry duck and fried ice cream. All items were amazing. If we lived in the area we would be back. Go here, you wont be disappointed.",1
trn_5905,"Came here for a late Saturday dinner, and was ready to try their chicken. I know my way around fried chicken, and needless to say, I was excited. The ambiance and space inside is awesome, with a light fixture that you can't help but stare at. 

Lewellyn's Fine Fries Chicken - Very, very good. Crispy and so so moist. Great seasoning too. While KFC might tout its original herbs and spices, with this fried chicken you can actually taste those spices. Just a great classic fried chicken with a black pepper kick. Truly fantastic and a must-try. 

Macaroni & Cheese - Served in a skillet with melted cheese and breadcrumbs on top. Looked promising when it hit the table, but turned out to be quite dry, as if it were in the broiler too long and dried out the cheese. Great cheese blend, but should have been a bit more creamy. 

Skillet Cornbread - If there's cornbread on the menu, you best believe I'm ordering it. This was disappointing as well. It was more of a dense cake with sweet cream butter on top than actual cornbread. And since it was served in. Cast iron skillet, I expected a bit more crunch around the edges. It's a shame that it relied on extra butter to be good... The menu states that there's bacon in it, but in reality there's not enough to even taste it. In fact, I made it a point to find it, and all I could find was a sad little speck.

The service here is good, the fried chicken here is excellent, but the sides we tried were just average.",1
trn_5906,I have been searching for a good nail place for MONTHS since my nail tech moved to California.

It's not like there were lines of RVs waiting to get in. In fact, there were several vacant spaces. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. The front office is the problem.",-1
trn_5908,"Loved how cute this place is!!!!  Not too many seating areas but so darn adorable.  Perfect for crowds of two. We came here on a Saturday around noonish.  I had the sweet potato cake....I was expecting the southern sweet potato but I don't think it was yam or southern sweet potato. The flavor was not as intense but I really enjoyed it.  Frosting wasn't too sweet and it had crumbles of pistachio and ...maybe cookie crumb on top?  I also really loved the green tea macarons. OMG, they were amazing.  I've never bought macarons from a bakery before (I've only baked them myself with average results). But my BFF has had them at other bakeries and she said they are amazing here.  I also tried the taro bun (it was okay) and the mini fried mocha balls (I wouldn't repurchase).  If you eat your items there, they put them on a cute metal tray with cute little forks.",1

Last time took a little longer to get there and when I said I was happy with the result, she asked me several times if I was sure and offered to go back until I was 100% satisfied. I was, and I really appreciated the time she took with me - I'm very, very particular about my brows and Haritha has consistently done an excellent job. She's the younger one there, and I believe she's there Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. At $10 for eyebrow threading it's good value too. Thank you, Haritha!",1
trn_5912,"WOW, simply put, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I had the pan seared salmon.  The salmon itself was excellent, very juicy and perfectly seared.  But the surprising part was the garnishes... there was some kind of garlic butter spinach on top, and the plate was lined with a pesto sauce (can't remember what kind).  The tastiest part of the meal, however, (besides the salmon) was the creamed white corn that the salmon rested upon.  I've never liked creamed corn (from the can) but this was VERY good.  It had the consistency of Cream of Wheat, and not the nasty, slimy creamed corn you used to eat as a kid.

Great, great food... I will definitely go back, I'd like to try one of their steaks next time I go.",1
trn_5913,"This In-N-Out is typically busy but the staff is always friendly. I've never had any issues with the taste of the food and I usually order the animal style fries which is my guilty pleasure. You can't go wrong with the cheeseburgers here and the prices are very reasonable for the food. I recommend this for a hamburger/cheeseburger & fries fix, oh and you can't go wrong with their chocolate milk shakes here!",1
trn_5914,"Ok.

This is an outdated old hair salon that doesn't offer anything fancy, but has some real great talent. 

Located along Birchmount Rd just north of Sheppard, I came in for the first time to meet with Donna. I was nervous. As I was waiting I saw another stylist by the name of Andy doing an outstanding job. He seemed in a trance while cutting that lucky girl sitting in the chair. When she got up I had I comment on how great her hair was. She said Andy was the best. So now I'm sitting there thinking I made a mistake and almost wanted to ask if he could cut my hair instead, but I could tell he was booked.

Donna was very friendly. She asked me what I wanted and did try her best to accommodate my request. She kept getting interrupted by other coworkers talking to her which made me nervous. The wash/cut and style took no longer than a half hour vs. Andy who takes about an hour and a half on a client. It wasn't a bad hair cut, it was average and I did leave happy.

trn_5916,"Beats having to track a food truck down just to get it. We used to go to the shave ice stand at the indoor swap meet on decatur and Snow ono...but since they all closed down...this is by far the next best thing. It's the closest thing to Hawaiian Shave Ice as you can get! They even serve that famous Dole. 

I love that it is situated in a mall. Beats having to stand in the sun on a scorching hot summer day with 2 kids, a toddler, and a baby in tow. It's located in the food court across the nail shop. How is a nail shop in a food court? It's not really, just gotta walk down a few steps after Panda Express and boom.

As for the clutter of random candy sold on their counter...I don't mind it. It just reminds me of the mom and pop shops back in HI. 4 stars because it only comes in 1 size. Wish they offered at least a kid size for those with children...5 bucks a kid is pretty steep and a waste if they don't finish it. So why don't I just use my brain and split between kids? Welp, with all the flavors to choose from...none of my boys will want to share or give up portioning. They'll end up fighting trying to scoop some of whoever has shave ice left. Nothing like a bunch of kids fighting to ruin the vibe. Lol

I can go on but you gotta go for yourself. You won't be disappointed and it really is a great treat esssspecially if you have dairy allergies (as a few of my kids do). 
Eat up then shop up after! Haha...",1

trn_5919,"the opera house is a really fun venue and convenient on a few fronts.  firstly its home to an enormous proscenium stage at the back that is even better viewed from the multi-tiered balcony.  that last sentence really combines a couple things.  the room itself is intimate enough to easily get within a couple feet of the performers to cry your eyes out and scream if you like.  the floor before the stage is pretty large; if this place were not as much of a rock venue, it would have the potential panache of an event hall for a wedding, or the grand presence for, i dont know, let's say...an opera.  and putting those two ideas together is a no brainer.  i often find myself staring up at the ceiling when im there to look at the ornate embellishments carved out many years ago, when im sure this was an opera house.

the other thing about this place is its balcony which is great when you dont want to be moshing in the mosh pit down below, but just want to dance with your head lets say.  it has a bar up there too - easier to get to then the bars that lie on either side of the stage.  actually, theres a bar at the back bottom too.

She also came up with the perfect veil which we hadn't planned to use one but like I said she's an angel and immediately knew the perfect veil.

Fresh soups, various sandwiches on fresh breads and baguettes, and premade sides like broccoli quinoa salad or a roasted potato salad. Each mouth they feature a special sandwich and salad as well. All the options are quite healthy and everything is so fresh. Very vegan and vegetarian friendly too. Do not leave without a sweet treat--their vegan chocolate chip cookie is to die for.

The bread! Wow! Seafood combo pho is a 5-star item too: complex broth, super fresh calamari, and not too much salt. Oh, speaking of fresh, I was teasing our server, asking him if he had to go dig up the bean sprouts in the back yard. Freshest ones I've ever had!

So, yes, five stars.",1

Hardly the best I'm sorry to say, but quite disappointed. It was ""OK"". The brussel sprout nachos were a surprisingly good change of pace for nachos, quite tasty (thank you to our server who recommended them!), watermelon and Paloma margaritas were pretty good (Paloma was the better of the 2), but my bean & cheese burrito was boring (no sauce, just a tortilla filled with refried beans and cheese.... no jalepenos, no sauce, nada, again, OK but I make better at home. The adobo chicken tacos were ok, the pineapple pork ones were better. I read other reviews that stated the staff aren't shy to remind you when it's closing time and this was our case as well. Very polite but basically ""Last call at the bar would you like another?"" ""Yes please!"" then as they were set in front of us ""We're technically closed right now so no rush but we're closed."" It was 5 minutes before the scheduled closing time. I get people are tired and want to leave but..........",-1

Le vendeur était très insistant et voulait  vraiment vendre, mais comme il m'avait fait le tour du magasin et bien expliqué ses produits, j'ai finalement acheté un mélange sans caféine Rêve Tranquille. Tous les prix sont affichés et pour une quantité de 50 g.  Le mien m'a coûté un peu plus de 5,00$.

J'avoue que cela revient cher, et je n'achèterai pas tous mes thés ici, mais pour se gâter à l'occasion ou pour faire un cadeau, c'est très bien. Et ce mélange de tisane est très bon et relaxant avant d'aller me coucher!",-1
trn_5947,"I had an 'accident' with a vacuum - operator mistake.  I was using the suction hose and didn't realize the beater brush was rotating and it melted a 9"" x 2.5"" grove in the carpet.  The carpet has a very random pattern with fibers running multiple directions and height and is a single color - making it extremely difficult to find a perfect match to drop in where the damage was cut out.  Daniel, the tech who arrived on time, spent a considerable amount of time figuring out how to match it.  He worked his magic and I can literally not tell where the repair was made.  I am ecstatic!  My wife didn't think it was worth it because it was under the edge of the carpet, but now - it's gone and back to looking like a single piece of carpet.

I also appreciate that Daniel worked with me (an out of town condo owner) on meeting my appointment needs.  He kept in good communications from the first time I reached out to Las Vegas Carpet Repair to understand my needs in terms of the carpet and my return to Las Vegas.",1
trn_5948,"This hotel has decent rooms and pool, however they are completely not organized and are understaffed. They have a free ""shuttle"" service within 5 miles radius which seems amazing. It was fine for getting to places but getting back to the hotel was impossible! We called them to pick us up twice and they said they would send someone.  Both times we waited 45 minutes. The first time after waiting we called to ask where the shuttle was and the shuttle was never sent out and was out on another call, so we would have to wait even longer!!! After paying a taxi to get us back to our hotel the shuttle was sitting in the front! A similar experience occurred with the shuttle service the second time. They have no system for using the shuttle or for getting a hold of the drivers. This is NOT the drivers fault it is on hotel management who need to get their stuff together. Our driver Brian was great! He was friendly and was always around to help with whatever we needed. Literally, he did a little bit of everything at the hotel from shuttle services to working on canoes and unloading cars. I hope they give him a raise!  I am amazed that this company offers little customer service for being in the hospitably business There is also a  female front desk  attendant who is completely unfriendly and rude to customers, while there is a male attendant who is good. We will not be back to this establishment and will not recommend it to anyone until they figure out systems that work.",-1

When I went back to tell him, he said that he didn't make it up out of thin air. What kind of a response is that? He blamed me because he said that it's based on my responses to his questions.

trn_5955,"Spoon is back! 

I quit going to Spoon at least a year ago. The space had gotten really tired, and the menu no longer had the feeling of excitement that it had when it first opened.  So I was interested but not optimistic about returning after learning that they had redecorated and hired a new executive chef. 

We came in on Sunday and discovered a new restaurant.  The layout is pretty much the same, but the tables are new, the lighting is new, everything feels fresh.  The menu is totally different--yay--and everything was so interesting we decided to just start out with small plates.  

We had a smoked blue fish plate, an outstanding crepe stuffed with cauliflower tikki masala, a seafood cazuala, and korean fried chicken.  All fantastic.  My favorite, though, was the side of turnips with a maple sauce and peppers.  So awesome.  We tried two desserts and both were off the charts good. 

I've been back 3 times.  Add the fish entre and steak for visits 2 & 3.  Both great.  Definitely an ATF in Pittsburgh.  One minor request--dim the lights just a little!  Too bright!

Service was pretty fast and they have a full bar so I, of course, had a beer while I waited.  The beer came in a frosty mug and I did see them making Margaritas, which looked pretty darn tasty.
I ordered the pulled pork spicy tacos.  They came with chips and home made salsa and of course all the regular fixins.  I never had a pulled pork taco before and it was delicious.  Tender and spicy and just enough sauce.  
There is a lunch menu that is served until 2:30pm and the prices are cheap, nothing over $8.50 and they come with home made chips and salsa.  My lunch was filling and hit the spot.
I'll have to make this a regular spot when I am craving Mexican.",1
trn_5962,"I had a party at my house for approximately 15 people, and was digging around for a caterer that was available on relatively short notice in the month of July (silly me).  When I was asking around, I had a few people recommend Red Tree Catering to me, so I figured that I was in good hands by checking them out.

When I walked in, everything looked good and the location is quaint and small.  There was a gal behind the counter that was extremely helpful.  She helped my mom and I choose the appetizers and even allowed us to sample a few of her recommendations, which sealed the deal on everything we picked.

We didn't hire them to come to my house and run the event, but simply to prepare the food in advance for us to pick up the day before.  There are a few very key things that impressed me about this caterer that I would like to share for anyone hiring them the way we did (go in, pick the menu, pick it up the day of the event type deal).

There are a few key things that really impressed me about Red Tree Catering:

- The hours were flexible enough that I could get everything done outside of office hours, including the pick up on Friday night (I was able to come there at 6 p.m., which did not impact my work day).

- As mentioned before, the gal behind the counter was EXTREMELY helpful and allowed us to try samples.  She also asked lots of questions abourt the guests that were going to be there and helped me choose items

- When I picked up the order, it was EXTREMELY well packed for transport and storage in my refrigerator (since I don't have a deli counter fridge at home). :)  I had no problem getting a relatively large order into my fridge in its original containers from the caterer.

- Some of the items that we ordered required assembly. Instructions in and on boxes were EXTREMELY clear about what chutney went with which appetizer, etc.  It was very straightforward to put it together without guessing which sauce went with what meat.

- I had a minor freak out moment the day before the event and called them to ask if they thought I had enough food for 15 people.  Rather than overselling me, they went through the order with me and assured me that I had more than enough food, and they were right. 

The important part of this story is that the food was OUTSTANDING.  This is a fancier caterer, so you wouldn't necessarily come here for sandwich trays, if you know what I mean.  It is gourmet food and it delivers unique flavours and high-end ingredients.

I saw a few comments on here about how overpriced some people felt it was.  I am not a person with an unlimited budget, but for us, for 15 people we were weighing whether to make a reservation and go out to dinner at someplace nice, like The Ranche or Open Range, versus catering a wide variety of high end appetizers and having a nosh-fest.  for 15 people, our bill came to $700, so that works out to approximately $46 a person and honestly it fed the party amply, and also gave us some amazing leftovers for the rest of the weekend.  I am pretty confident by the time I got appetizers, meals and desserts, I wouldn't have got out of the restaurant at $46 a head, and we grazed all afternoon.  For our audience, it made sense.  

I will also say that i checked out two other gourmet caterers.  One competitor was in the same price point ($18-$30 per dozen, depending on item), and the other was MUCH more expensive (a dozen lamb kabobs were $65 per dozen).  In my opinion, Red Tree may be a pricier option if you compare many caterers across the city with varied menu, but when I compared gourmet caterers with fancier fare, I was thrilled with what we paid, and for how much we got.",1

trn_5968,"""When the moon hits your eye that's Amore!!'...

Amore in Italian means love... love to me means food and for food they do it right at Francesca's Bakery! 

When one thinks of the Scarborough food scene, most automatically think Asian, South Asian or Caribbean, but this is a gem of an Italian Bakery serving the Scarborough area since 1994.  

Serving baked goods such as cakes, breads, sweets, they also have a fantastic hot table with their very popular arancini rice balls.

The rice balls are a size of a tennis ball and comes in two ways....traditional meat filling and a cheese version.  Both are fantastic especially when warm along with the tomato sauce so do yourself a favour and eat in the dining area.

The baked goods are wonderful with their most popular item being the Silician cannolis.  Fried cannoli shells filled with a ricotta cream.  Your really can't go wrong with that combo!

This is a family run bakery that has really become an institution in an area not known for Italian fare.

Much love, much amore for Francesca's!",1

trn_5971,"I have moved to Aurora for a year, and I CANNOT believe I did not discover this noodle house any sooner! Cambodian Noodle King was recommended by Chef Heather who lives in Aurora for over 30 years, and she has been a loyal customer ever since she found out about this hole in the wall. How can I pass up on this opportunity to explore good food? lol. I made it my mission to visit the next morning for brunch!

This family owned restaurant is completely tucked away in a plaza of an industrial area, NE of Leslie Street / Davis Drive. The family working there is absolutely friendly and attentive. They can also speak a bit of Cantonese. Love the grandpa, he is so adorable ^^ The family often checks up on the customers. The chef in the kitchen also comes out to make sure the food is delicious and up to par.

All the noodles they use are Cambodian style noodles; it is very different from pho noodles. The noodles are light, thin and chewy, similar to glass noodles! I would much prefer this over pho now hahaha... sorry pho!

Highly recommend the Pad Thai - this dish has a serious kick to it but spicy good. #18 Beef stew with noodles in a beef broth - definitely a must for beef lovers. #22 House special with noodles is my personal favourite - especially delicious with that garlicky soup base!

This noodle house is now my new favourite spot for noodle cravings! Hope you guys can also give them a try if you're in the area :) Keep up the great work, Cambodian Noodle King! #supportlocalbusiness",1

trn_5975,"I've been to a number of Melt locations over the past few years including the original but this was my first time at this location. For 8 on a Saturday night I really didn't think we would get in very quickly and to be honest I wasn't really looking forward to it. I've gone so many times I was feeling burnt out. Plus you are paying $10-$15 or more for a glorified grilled cheese sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, they are amazing but at the end of the day it is still a grilled cheese at a premium.

To my surprise there were several seat options at the bar so we sat right away. I've always liked the decor at Melt being a Cleveland Fan. This location had the normal fare like vintage holiday light up yard decorations and Cleveland sports memorabilia.  All good stuff. The service was top notch and our bartender was very attentive even making beer suggestions and handing us several samples. He was talkative and really made you feel welcome.  I could hangout with this guy was the vibe I got.

I ordered the Wet Hot Buffalo Chicken sandwich which ran me $13.50 for a full sandwich. I've not had it before.  I figure if I'm eating here again, I'm getting something different each time I come.  What an incredibly flavorful sandwich! The coleslaw and blue cheese were a great combo! I got really silly and dipped it in the provided ranch a few times which was equally good.  The fries were nice and fresh and I always get a side of sriracha ranch to dip them in.

We were in and out in under an hour and 10 minutes.   I wasn't looking forward to it on this day but in the end was glad we ended up here. Between the food, service and atmosphere it was a good evening and now a viable option for when I'm in the area.",1

trn_5980,"Went to Happy Dog on a Saturday cuz me and the girlfriend were dying for a dog with Everything Cream Cheese.  Seriously, you guys are geniuses for thinking that stuff up and I have stole that recipe as my own for a party dip.
BUT
When we showed up there was a band playing, that was loud on the outside and when we got in, had to shout to the guy at the door 3-4 times about getting in, that there was a $4 cover ($8 for the both of us).  I COULD NOT HEAR THE GUY A FOOT AWAY. I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING. I left. I'm not paying extra to go deaf and I'd like to talk to the person I go with.  I wouldn't mind the cover if the band was playing at a volume that didn't cause instant ear damage. We are 20-somethings, I love metal, rock and rap so loud music is normally not a problem.  But if you actually wanted to listen to the bad, stand outside.
Happy Dog, you missed out on a $30+ check from booze and food because your band was too loud and you wanted to charge us to go deaf.  Your establishment is too small to necessitate amps, or at least don't let the band turn it up so loud. Your place is small, you don't need it that loud.

We went to the Melt instead and it was fantastic.

I will rate you guys again next time I visit and that rating will be about food and service.  This one was about how I was unable to eat here.",-1

I am constantly in search of the perfect Pad Thai, so when a thai friend recommended this place, had to try.....

My meal:
Pad Thai:  awesome!  Table spices were super fresh (hotter than I expected) and the noodles were excellent.  5 stars.

My friend's meal:
Pad woon sen:  2.5 out of 5 (by her reporting); she ordered ""combination: chicken, beef, and shrimp"" and received LITERALLY one (1) shrimp.  ONE.... The flavor of the noodles was great, she said, but there were way too many onions, carrots, and not enough meat.",1
trn_5982,We love our new safe from Safe Keeper. They were extremely professional and courteous. They delivered on time and carefully installed our new safe by bolting it down.

trn_5983,"I came here recently for a full day work event.  It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect.  

The place was in a building that looked like a small house.  When I went inside it was really beautifully decorated and we had an area sectioned off to ourselves by these big wooden walls that slid back and forth.  

As part of our event we got to prep and cook our own meals as a team building exercise.  We had a caprese salad, chicken parmesan with fettuccine alfredo, and tiramisu for dessert.  We were a bit nervous based on our teams cooking skills, but the chef and helpers were extremely friendly and helpful.  The meal turned out amazing and was so delicious!  The chicken parmesan had a bit of a kick to it, which went really great with the Alfredo sauce on the pasta.  The tiramisu had a splash of Marsala wine which made it a bit different than your typical.

Amazing!  Would recommend.",1

I think next time, I'd like to try the savory foods that they have.",1
trn_5985,"I won't mince words: Oishii Sushi is the best AYCE Sushi experience in Calgary in all aspects. 

I've had my eye on Oishii for a while now, but haven't really bit the bullet to go as it is a little far from downtown. I am glad I finally made the trek on a whim on a Friday night, because it really hit the spot for me. Despite the nondescript outside appearance of a small restaurant in a strip mall, it actually is massive, modern, clean, and well apportioned from a space perspective. Great ambiance - lively but not roaring. The Bathrooms were unexpectedly clean, classy, and well designed decor wise, with soft jazz playing for your while you make room for your next order.

It was extremely busy. I don't know if I just picked an uncommonly busy Friday to try my luck, but I showed up at 6:10 and wasn't seated until 6:40. The joint was packed despite having a huge number of tables. 

Luckily I got a quiet corner booth. Overall the quality of the space is high, and cleanliness standards are well above average. Service was very good. The servers were prompt, checked in on you often, and never messed up an order (which is unheard of for AYCE Sushi, they always forget something). 

Now, onto the menu. Regular Dinner ($28) and Deluxe Dinner ($33). The additional items offered on the deluxe menu were not worth the value for me as only one of us would have enjoyed it - the only things that caught my eye on the deluxe menu were the crab legs, oysters, and Tataki. Everything else (beef rolls, for example) I see as low value and not worth it. 

That being said, the regular dinner menu was actually pretty impressive. Of course, my focus was sushi: the rolls are pretty generous with fish content and don't overload on rice, which is a mistake I see at many sushi AYCE. The sushi had a pretty thin cut of fish, which is less desirable, but with Sashimi on the menu, you can make up for that. 

The Sashimi selection was okay, but the sashimi order always arrived dead last after a long delay as compared to everything else. This was a turn off for me, as it was so exaggerated it was clearly an intentional method to ensure that you wouldn't order too much sashimi. So if you go, make it a point to order extra sashimi in your first order, and then expect to have it arrive with everything else you've ordered for your second order. 

A few interesting ones that I don't usually see elsewhere: I liked the Salmon Yukke (tartar), and the creamy udon. I would avoid the dim sum as it is mediocre. 

Overall very good experience at Oishii - going forward there is absolutely no where else i will go for AYCE Sushi.",1
trn_5986,"I would not suggest this place! The lady is nice, but the services are poor!! I made an appointment online (and was told if you arrive more than 15 minutes late your appointment will be canceled). I arrived right on time, and then I had to wait 50 minutes while she finished the appointment ahead of me. 

This is a one woman show and not your typical mani/pedi salon. No magazines, no bubbly spas to soak your feet in, no massage chair,  no large assortment of polish choices. After picking from a limited selection of polish, you sit down in a chair. The woman then fills a bowl of water (like literally takes a bowl to the faucet and fills it with water) and places it in front of your feet. 

Overall, I had to wait forever despite having an appointment. I was at the salon for 2 1/2 hours. My pedi and gel mani were awful!! I have already made an appointment to have a  proper gel mani and pedi at a nice location tomorrow.",-1
trn_5987,"Got my usual large milk black tea with egg pudding $6.99. The egg pudding was harder than normal. It should be soft and silky smooth. Finished the drink but left the egg pudding to show my displeasure...hehe

Also got the green tea ice cream + shaved ice with red bean and condensed milk for $6.99. The presentation was nice and the first few bites were pretty good but it got boring fast. The shaved ice is like slush after about 5 minutes. 

Also got one of their hot taro drinks for I believe $4.99. Not my favourite flavour so I won't comment about it. 

Service was fast and friendly. Compared to other bubble tea places I think Ten Ren's is falling behind. I like Chatime way better and there are other places which have much better selection in terms of snacks and dessert like Cha Me Cha. I don't think I will ever visit a Ten Ren's ever again. Its officially on my ""banned list"" BUT not because the snacks and drinks here are terribly bad but other places just offer much better for the same expensive price.",-1
trn_5988,"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and cozy. It is like your typical American restaurant when it comes to the food like Yard House or Claim Jumpers - but what is unique about Lazy Dog is that you can bring your dog with you!

First time visiting was for a friend's birthday dinner. I got the pasta Carbonara. It was a pretty good portion, however, I thought that it was too salty. My friend, who had ordered the mushroom pizza thought hers was pretty salty, too.

I did like the fact that if you checked in to the restaurant you get a free appetizer, so we got a basket of their really good basket of fries.

The place was packed, considering we did dine in on a Friday evening; however, the service took a very long time. The waitress did not check in on our table enough, and we were a pretty big group. Also, since we could not get a hold of our server, it took an even longer time to get our checks. Overall, we spent a little bit over 2 hours in the restaurant, so the efficiency on a busy evening is very poor.",0
trn_5989,Probably THE best hotpot place i've been to. It's NOT AYCE because all the meat and seafood they serve are top quality meat. Their specialty would probably be the beef. You have quality beef that ranges from 10-30 bucks a plate and then you have beef that's like $50 for a few slices... If you're a beef fanatic... this is the place for you buddy. you'll think the beef you eat anywhere else is crap after you have the beef here. Did I mention you get individual pots and soup bases? I personally like the individual pots cause i don't like having people sticking things i don't like into the same soup base as me...,1

Donna does a wonderful job cleaning your nails and makes sure they're shaped just how you want them. This salon is a gem, extremely comfortable and very affordable. I have really difficult nails and she made them exactly how they needed to be.",1

trn_5992,"We go as a team to this place every Thursday night after softball usually have great service. Last night was totally a cluster. Waitress was very nice and apologetic, I watched the one bartender work as hard as possible to keep up. We had 2 drinks in 2 hours waited on food for an hour (24 Wings). I approached the manager asked if he could give the bartender some help he said "" the kitchen is behind and that is where he was needed"". I then watched him approach bar pull tickets and rudely slam them in front of bartender and say ""Do these"". We also observed him sit and talk to his parents sitting at corner of the bar for 45 minutes (which they had prompt service) and neglect the atmosphere within the place. We usually leave seeing a full restaurant but we all noticed it was slow upon our exit. Policy: care for your staff, your customers and visit your parents on your time off. Lost our teams visit every week.",-1

To Whom it may concern;
ATT:
HOTEL MANAGER



 
After staying at the Venetian last March 27th  for my 36th wedding anniversary and having the most pitiful disgraceful room, as well as my wife cutting her foot open on the exposed carpet tacks on the stairs in the room, we moved out of this horrible room and was accommodated beautifully at the ENCORE, for less money in a suite of much higher standard. I was told at the Venetian that there were no suites available. However when I called into the reservation center, there was no shortage of rooms, just the rate was an issue. To say the least when I had to call to the front desk about our room for six hours until finally I gave in around midnight, my wife who wanted to just get out so we could have the few minutes left of our anniversary. Fortunately we were made very comfortable at the Encore, never to return to the Venetian after running my anniversary. 

After a couple of weeks we received a two day complimentary offer from the Palazzo Hotel in lieu of the horrible experience we had at the Venetian. I choose to take a chance and took up the offer from the Palazzo to spend my 60th birthday in May. To say the least the room was great the stay was as nice, until I was accosted from a very poorly trined security guard Mike at the entrance to the self parking garage.  I did not come to a complete stop at the garage entrance and he started raising his voice and being exceptionally rude. When I opened my window he asked me if I was blind and then flashed a high power flashlight in my eyes. I got out of my car and had several harsh words with this unprofessional and dangerous employee. I was refused assistance from the hotel staff at the scene when I called in. Only after I came into the hotel and went to a manager in the floor. He summoned a security manage, who introduced me to a very professional young man by the name of Matt. I filled out a hand written statement, and to date I have not had any apology or response to this assault from your poorly trained guard. A typical rent a cop attitude. 

The one thing that the Venetian and Palazzo has truly done is to make me a 100%  Wynn/Encore client. 

Sincerely",-1
trn_5995,"Close to home, kickass haircuts and the price is right. Wandered in here while back, got a great haircut from Polo and have been back ever since. Right next to Napa on Scottsdale road, they do mostly guys haircuts, fades, etc.  I have never had a bad experience here, other than more people have clearly figured this place out and it's getting more crowded....

Good guys, great service, support local business and get yourself here.  Polo and Bobby are awesome!",1
trn_5996,Okay I haven't been here in a few years since ive moved back to San Francisco but still wanted to send a review to this awesome place. I've taken my 2002 Volvo at the time here a few times when I had issues and I've never felt ripped off or taken advantage of. They were always communtive and courtesy. Also one point my family drove to Vegas in a 2000 jeep which broke down at baker. Luckily there was a 2nd car used to make it to Vegas. My moms ins company didn't help & the baker mechanic was horrible. So it was left over night but I gave my mom the # for imperial and they helped so much! Went above and beyond and fixed it before they left to return back home. Amazing service !,1
trn_5997,"I'm not a fan of this place at all. I first came here with a friend several years ago for her bridal gown fitting and even from then on, I sensed a lack of good customer service.

Now that it's my turn, I decided to check out the same place and was helped by someone named Vira. I came with my future MIL at 7pm on a Thursday evening. Vira failed to ask me what my budget was until midway through my appointment and she had already given me a bunch of dresses to try which was way higher than what I had wanted to spend.  She was so unprofessional and ruined my wedding gown shopping experience that day. She didn't really seem to know what she was doing or how to effectively communicate with others.  I also tried on maybe 15 dresses and she seemed to have trouble understanding what I was looking for after I and my future MIL explained to her multiple times about the style I wanted. For majority of the appointment, she wouldn't let my MIL look for dresses for me and told her to sit down instead. Eventually, my MIL stepped in and found a couple of dresses that were more appropriate than what Vira had originally showed me.

In addition, this sales person was condescending and kept repeating that I could make changes to the dress and add or remove fabric here and there. Excuse me, but I'm here looking to BUY a dress, not DESIGN my own dress! At one point, when I told her I didn't like something about a dress, she said ""You're not a child, but I've told you before that you can change this.""  Look, I'm the type who needs to see the actual dress on me to really know what it looks like. It's hard for me to imagine what it COULD look like by removing pieces of fabric and altering it significantly. I'm not going to buy a dress and then make all these changes and realize that it doesn't actually look good.  My goal was to find a dress with as little trouble as possible but this lady was causing me so much unnecessary stress. BTW: I was told that alterations are $450 flat rate.

Also, this whole ""no photographs"" rule is ridiculous. How are we supposed to know how we look in photographs?! I understand that some people take advantage and post a bunch of photos of wedding dresses online but taking ONE photo of a dress that I really liked wasn't even permitted at all. Also, nobody was around.  This rule certainly caused them to lose my business.  They really should change that because all of the other comparable places I've been to have allowed it, or have been lenient when they weren't as busy in the store (when I went, I was the only one there). They have a large selection of dresses but most stores carry very similar dresses, so that's why I'm not afraid to write this review before I actually buy my dress.  I'm definitely not going back there.

The sales person was also very pushy in the sense that she expected me to buy the dress right away after my first day of trying on dresses. As I was leaving, she was saying that I had to order it NOW because it won't come until March--blah blah blah...It's July 2016 and my wedding is in June 2017. I'm pretty sure I didn't need to buy it on that particular day.",-1
trn_5998,"I used to have breakfast from their food truck at Atherton Mill so I was BEYOND excited when I found out they were opening a restaurant.

They are a little off the main drag, not a fancy building.  But I am not looking for that. Its a pleasure  to leave an auto repair shop where I feel like a got a good deal.
Highly recommended!",1
trn_6001,"Yes, I just gave this donut house a five star rating.  Winchell's is benefiting from the wave of nostalgia that came over me when I walked in with my pal Matt after dinner at Wendy's Noodle House.  It was already 8:30pm, but the cases were FULL of fresh donuts.  I remember having Winchell's all the time when I was growing up in SoCal and they were everywhere.  I'm sure I've driven by this one, but never stopped in until tonight.  Matt told me they're open 24 hours, too--curses!  I don't need to know that.  He's just paying me back for telling him that Keebler Grasshopper cookies are the same thing as the Girl Scouts' Thin Mints and can be had year-round.  Now we're even.  Four donuts for $2.99 cannot be beat and the memories that Winchell's brings back are priceless.",1

trn_6003,"I had wanted to try Sapori for a long time, especially with so many nice reviews.  I finally ordered take out on a Saturday after a long day of yard work.  Honestly, I was disappointed.  The food was very average at best and, in my opinion, doesn't come close to nearby competitors like Fratellos, Nino's, etc.  The Chicken Parmigiana was better than the Scarpariello.  The Scarpariello had what seemed like a sweetness to the sauce...which definitely doesn't go with garlic, hot peppers, and sausage.  Sorry, the menu looks so good and I wanted to like it, but the flavors and quality just were not there.",-1
trn_6004,"Grabbed dinner here on a Thursday night before a show at Playhouse Square. Our server selected our beers for our flight based on other beers I liked and she suggested her favorite picks. The pork shank is TO DIE FOR. You must order this - such a unique cut of meet but it's delicious, especially with homemade buttermilk dressing and kimchi. The calamari was great and so were the bacon wrapped dates. The pierogi flatbread was creative but not my favorite. I'd certainly return for more porkshank and to try some other dishes.",1
trn_6005,I was so excited to have soup salad and breadsticks with my new gift card for dinner. We sat down and waited to be greeted and the first thing our waiter told us is that they're out of salad. How is this possible when their salad is what they're known for?? Poor planning on their gms part and a loyal Olive Garden patron lost.,-1
trn_6006,"you spend 2$ for hours of fun and learning. They have an inside area full of interesting stuff about the history of vegas, henderson and boulder city. then you move outsite they have a whole area dedicated to early american history of the mojave, and then they litteraly have a train depot and a whole neighbourhood like you were teleported back in time to the 60's 50's 40's 20's and early 1900's really cool place (depending on the house). They even have a printing press on site!  Take the kids, family and friends! I do not reccomeend this trek in the afternoons during summer.  Plus the folks from the pawnshop show own it if that means anything to anyone....",1
trn_6007,"This place is very busy during lunch to dinner because of their awesome dimsum menu and their Chinese menu in general.

I love the atmosphere of the place. Very good for a starving group of family/friends. Wide variety of food choices and their presentation of the food is good too. Mouth watering looking dimsum.

Spacious place though you have to wait during peek hours. 

We also tried coming here 45 min before they closed and the food was still satisfying. Though I would have prefered if they still serve dimsum before they close. Sometimes I just have this late night dimsum cravings! 

The only downside here probably is the servers are sometimes hard to understand or I don't know if they understood me or not or vice versa. Though since they got the orders right- i guess it's just me! 

I'm also glad about their location here in Bedington! I don't have to go downtown to satisfy my dimsum cravings- though I still wish they serve dimsum late at night!",1
trn_6008,"I went there with friends on a business trip. They offer small plates meant for sharing. We had falafels, a couple of flatbread varieties, street tacos and the brussel sprouts. They were all excellent, especially the brussel sprouts.
It was so good we tried to go back the next night, but they were closed for a private party. I'm sorry I didn't get to try some of the other woodfire veggie dishes.",1

We discovered Island Style around 12 years ago when Ivan welcomed us the first time we visited Las Vegas with our young children.  Since his passing, we have been greeted by Russell.  He is always very sweet and always makes you feel like you are coming home.  The food is amazing and you get good portions as well.  You are always treated like family when you go there, no matter who you are.  We ordered the Meat Jun which comes with rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. This is a must have.  We also ordered their fried rice, delicious teriyaki chicken and pork cutlet.  Great place to go for that comfort food craving!",1
trn_6010,"After 4 hours and hundreds of dollars spent on an unnecessary CT scan, we still have no cause for my symptoms. I tried getting in to my PCP, but was referred to this Urgent Care since my PCP didn't have an opening for a month! I came here because I truly needed medical care and I got scammed. 

I heard through the thin wall that the NP on duty was counting down until his shift was over. 
The consequence of this is that I was not listened to at all and I received improper care. The staff scared me into thinking I had a medical emergency just so that I would open my wallet to pay for an unnecessary procedure or go away to the ER. This way, the NP could mentally check out while still covering his own ass.

4 hours later, I feel scammed and I still have to spend more time and money tomorrow finding out what the real issue is. They didn't listen to me or my primary care physician and led me down an expensive and stressful path. It's so sad what healthcare has turned into!

I feel like this place is open 24 hours, close to the strip, just to scam tourists maybe? I don't know. Not a good experience :(",-1

trn_6013,"I stumbled in here with no appetite and swearing I'll never drink again. Then I ordered the small mac and cheese, the shrimp po boy sliders and a bourbon bacon bloody mary.

This place is gorgeous and colorful and has a patio right on the strip. I'm glad shake shack was too packed to take us, otherwise, I wouldn't have popped my head in here. Menu is a standard $10-25 but can be more with a steak or drinks or what not. The food was great.

Mac & Cheese- this small plate isn't a small plate and it came piled with pico de gallo and shreaded meat. I've never had this twist on a mac & cheese before and not sure if I loved it. BUT I love the idea of it. On any other given day, I would order this as would anybody else. Who doesn't want a crack mac and cheese?

Shrimp po boy sliders- came with 3 of these babies. Same thing, I loved the concept. The shrimp was battered and fried and I prefer them grilled but It was still good. 

The bourbon bloody mary- Was ok. 3 stars. It was more ice than blood mary and it was poorly garnished. And normally a bacon bloody mary comes with a strip of crispy bacon but this one didn't. 

Anyhow, our waiter was super friendly, attentive, and asked if we needed a split check at the BEGINNING instead of the mess at the end. Greatly appreciated it.",1
trn_6014,I felt like rice & beans so I thought of trying Federico's since we had only had their breakfast burritos before. I went with the Green Chile plate which came with a big flour tortilla. I assumed it was beef but I honestly couldn't tell what kind of meat it was since it was swimming in green chile sauce. It was tasty though. And I really liked the rice & beans. Very filling plate!,1
trn_6015,"We had a company social gathering at the PSH. We had a good time. The food we had was catered there by the staff and was delicious.

This is a place I could see coming after work or on the weekends with friends.",1
trn_6016,"I would love to tell you all about their gelato. However, they really have no order system or any sort of line that you wait in. You are just supposed to rush the counter and I guess it's first come first serve. Worked my way to the front with my 4 year old in tow. I started to place my order once one of the terrified overwhelmed servers attempted to make eye contact. I was interrupted by an impatient woman demanding free samples of the strawberry. This repeated itself 3 more times, as my order was interrupted and not filled...and I finally realized I was wasting my time. My son and I left and walked next door to Cream and were served in half the time with none of the confusion. Note to management: Invest a few bucks in a couple of cones and make a line? Stop wasting everyone's time. You make it impossible for your staff to manage your customers efficiently. I'm not interested in getting into a mosh pit or screaming match to order gelato. I do not care how tasty it supposedly is....And BTW, I was trying to place and order that I was actually paying for, only to get over run by people trying to feed their families of 6 entirely with FREE SAMPLES. The best part is, that while waiting in line at your competitor, several people behind me were openly complaining about the same issue I had with this establishment and opted to also take their money elsewhere. Hopefully management learns and makes the necessary changes, otherwise we will not be back.",-1
trn_6017,"We visited Little Piggy's recently for a company gathering. Considering the neighbourhood, the prices seemed a bit outrageous initially, but in the end we were quite satisfied. Most items are very shareable and you would probably have the best experience if you come here in a group of 4-6 people. 

We tried the beef BBQ for 3 (~$70) which came with a plethora of sides. Realistically this was more than enough meat for 5 people to share. In addition we ordered the seafood pancake, LA style ribs and bibimbap. As a big bibimbap fan I was left a bit disappointed by the one served here, but most of the other dishes/ sides were spot on. The LA style short ribs were well seasoned and just saucy enough without making a mess, and the seafood pancake had just the right balance. In addition the service, cleanliness and chic ambiance made for an overall pleasant experience. 

Overall, this isn't the typical Bloor St. Korean join you're used to, but that may actually be a good thing for once.",1

However, it seems like the quality of the food has gone down a bit.  For being once of the more expensive buffets in Vegas I expect more.  They do offer high end items such as snow crab legs, king crag legs, buffalo, and duck, but none of them were up to par in my opinion.  The service is still very good and prompt.  I do think their desserts are one of the better in the round of Vegas buffets.  I think i'll go back to the Wynn next time for another try.",0

We started off with the Tori Kara Age (Japanese friend chicken) which came with a chili mayo dip. While the flavor was on point, the fried chicken wasn't as crunchy as I anticipated which I'd argue was due to taking it in a to-go container. I'd be interested to try it again at the restaurant.
Onto the ramen--ah the delicious ramen. I got the Tonkotsu and added bok choy. It was INCREDIBLE. The bone broth was outstanding--super rich and earthy. And the smoked pork belly makes my mouth water just thinking about it. My boyfriend got the Hiyashi and loved it, although it was more of a noodle bowl and had less broth than mine.
I will absolutely be trying Futo Buta again, hopefully sit-down next time!",1

It's such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa, trust me after eating those you'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good, but NO ,to Quote Jenn H.  it is  ""Blech. Die.""

If and when I come back I'll stick to the chips and salsa, I also would usually order the table side gauc , but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from it.......take your time chef and finely chop that shit!!

However, it was SO YUMMY! 

First thing that impressed us was their beef noodles soup. Beef was tender, soup was tasty, not too salty. 

We ended up almost going there every day during our stay in Vegas. And we figured the best dish was still beef noodles soup after trying other dishes.

Great customer service and they did what they promised.",1
trn_6041,"This was our go to late night place while staying at the Venetian. We opted to sit at the bar and try their happy hour specials along with a few things off their menu.

I woud HIGHLY recommend the Miso Chilean sea bass, as it was once of the BEST I have ever had. The vegetables that came with it were so tender and delicious, even though I hate Brussels sprouts, the rest were quite good.

The Spicy tuna rolls were really good also, though small compared to other places I've had them.

The BEST vegetable dish I've had in a long time were the Collard Greens in an asian dressing. They were crunchy and filling enough for two. Though, next time I'm not sharing! 

Another stand out to me were the Fried plantains. Normally, restaurants cut them thick and serve them with sides of beans and sour cream. I loved that these were cut thin and lightly breaded, deep fried and sprinkled only with some shavings of cheese. 

Besides the sea bass, the items we got were only $5-6 bucks a dish and easily can be split by two. This was probably my favorite place to dine while there and probably one of the better late night dining options you have if you don't feel like burgers or sandwiches.

I would have loved to give them a full 5 stars but the bar people were much to slow in not only forgetting to ask our order but forgetting to bring us our drinks after having to ask  three times, while serving those who just sat down right away. Otherwise, the food was fantastic!",1

trn_6047,"Places like this are quite addicting.  I'm both sad and glad I don't live in the area because I'd be spending way too much time eating here.

Based on the menu, I think this should be renamed the home of the corned beef everything.  Corned beef, in various iterations seems to be the everyday menu item.  Not that I mind, really.  My biggest decision was deciding on a regular sandwich or a classic reuben, while my co-worker tried to decide between the pastrami or the philly steak.  Fortunately for him, the menu had many choices that aren't centered on corned beef.  I guess that's the point of a deli, though, and another reason why living near a place like this would be bad news.

If everything else tastes as good as what I did order, you won't go wrong.  The place was busy, even in the early afternoon, but the staff kept up, even managing to hold off on the eye rolling as these non-locals asked lots of questions.  Our server had a good sense of humor, and that made the food taste even better.",1

I ordered the chocolate milkshake and a banana strawberry crepe. They forgot the strawberries even though I paid extra, I didn't say anything,  our server was too nice and busy.
The milkshake was good but nothing special,  I prefer Licks' or William's' milkshakes over this one (and they're a tad cheaper).",0

After reporting the damage to Epic Valet their answer was to take them to court, but I will need a lawyer because the security footage from 2211 E Camelback to prove they did the damage requires a subpoena according to the property manager (I have already checked into obtaining this).  So it requires retaining a lawyer, more money would be spent in legal fees to prove my case then it would cost to fix the car myself and they are well aware of this.  They did $1100 of damage to my car and I am left with the bill for their careless attendant.",-1

trn_6052,"I've always been a fan of the razor because it's inexpensive and pain-free, despite its annoying need of every-other-day maintenance. Meh - the trade off was more than worth it in my eyes.

But shaving my bikini area was a big hassle and NOT as easy as shaving my legs, so last Boxing Day (2014) I decided to take the plunge and go for a Brazilian. Forget about dipping my toes in the water - I'm a tough cookie and figured I'd go all in.

Based on Yelp reviews, I booked Melanie and she was just fantastic. Explained everything to me in detail, had 30 Rock playing and took a break whenever I needed. Because it was my first time waxing (anything), I was unaware you had to trim first, so I'm sure that ramped up the pain level. And though I went in for a Brazilian, I couldn't go through with it and Melanie suggested we stop at a thong-kini instead.

I was all set to see Melanie again tomorrow but because of scheduling conflicts, I had to rebook with Charise. She, too, was simply amazing: super nice, took cues from me in conversing instead of pushing the chitchat, told me why both hard and soft wax are used, and was incredibly quick. I also learned my lesson from the first time and trimmed, and the result was just about as pain-free as one can get from waxing.

So, it's $40 for a thong-kini. Pricey? Perhaps, a little bit. But when I think about not having to bother with a razor anymore and being able to enjoy my thong-kini for about a month, it's well worth it.",1

But by the time we flagged down a server we were so annoyed we just asked and paid the bill.  We left more than half the pitcher of beer untouched.  We did mention that the beer tasted bad, to which the server feigned concern but then never came back to confirm that she actually checked it out.

Many professionals recommend from 6 to 10 treatments to see permanent results, because of this I was completely expecting to purchase more treatments after finishing my groupon sessions. However, the reason why I did not bother finishing my treatments with Simplicity was because from the first session they began pushing their memberships. I didn't mind it at first since I am also in sales and I obviously was considering getting other parts done based on these results. Still, after my second session the tech informed me that I might need up to 10-12 complete sessions. Then, on my third session the tech informed me that I would need up to 16-18 treatments. Finally after my fourth session, the tech claimed I would need 22-24 sessions to see permanent results. I am completely aware of hormonal hair growth and the many reasons for touch ups, but 24 consecutive treatments for my feminine facial hair definitely seemed excessive. There is no way I was about to buy a 24 month plan for one area.",-1
trn_6061,"I have been going to Dr. Auto on W. Craig for two years now.  I'm a transplant from California and needed a new garage to care for my cars.  Tried a few shops in Summerlin but they were over-priced and tried to make me repair things that didn't need to.  I found this business on Angie's List.  So I got a second opinion on the so-called issues. They performed free diagnosis and low and behold the issues weren't real.  I have to drive a bit to get there but it's worth it.

Nick Chavez  (Service Manager) is very knowledgeable and down to earth.  Their work is above par and pricing is fair.  They even give discounts to vets.  They also have a smog check station and car wash.  I get discounts for smog checks and even free car washes plus they have a discount program where you buy a punch card for discounted services and oil changes. If you just use the oil change deals, you will have made your money back and then some. Join their rewards plan (for free) and lots of discounts are provided. Even if you don't get any repairs, you can use these discounts toward the purchase of the punch card. 

In closing.  My one gripe is that the shop on W. Craig has 3 service bays so they're quite busy.  Call ahead to schedule a service, but if you need to tow your vehicle there due to an emergency, I'm sure they'll do their best to accommodate you (it's happened to me already).",1
trn_6062,"This place is alright. I'd give it more stars except I can never find what I'm looking for and the staff always seem to want to avoid eye contact (except once--that one guy was super nice--he didn't know what the hell we were talking about, but he was super nice).

If I could find out what dept the product I was looking at online was in, that'd be a huge help. However, their website fails to illuminate almost as badly as their parking lot lights. The irony of half the store being lit up like Christmas with hanging light fixtures mocking you while you walk in from the nearly pitch-black parking lot isn't lost on me. 

Do you want copper wire? Check out the electrical section. Oh, unless you wanted something smaller than 12-gauge. Then you'll have to try your luck in hardware. Did they say hardware? Oops--they meant automotive... Because that makes sense. And don't expect a selection: It's 22-gauge or nothin'.

Did you want soldering iron tips? Ha. Only if you buy a brand new soldering iron. Because they sell refillable soldering irons, but no refill tips--because heaven forbid you should actually want to use the thing repeatedly.

I've used the bathroom here twice now. Both times, I thought I must have just narrowly missed a gut blowout. There's no ventilation and the ladies room smells awful. Save yourself.

Last time I went, I bought a stone floor tile. It wasn't marked, and the cashier spent about 10 minutes looking through the garden section of her price book, as I repeatedly told her it was a piece of stone floor tile... From the flooring section. 

She finally called her manager over because she couldn't find it, and I explained again to the manager that it was from the flooring section, that it was $1.88, and that it was a 6"" x 18"" piece of natural slate (as I'd stated previously to the cashier who was hell-bent on calling it a garden paver). BAM. There it was in the freaking computer (under ""flooring,"" in case you were wondering).

Takeaway: Make sure you've got time and patience. Knowledge of the store helps too. And dear God - never use the bathroom.",-1

trn_6064,"Dr. Angel is a sweetheart and she has (mostly) an amazing staff. I have been going to her office since she opened, and have referred many other people to her as well. I would be a life-time customer, until this morning when I had a very brief conversation with her new receptionist (who has been there 3 months), who I can't even name because she talks like the phone is shoved down her throat. 

I called to cancel my appointment at noon, and my appointment was for 10am the next day. Because I did not cancel within 24 hours, I was going to charged an additional $25. 

However, the last three appointments I had scheduled with them, had to be moved around for their convenience...with just about 24 hours notice. 

Every time I go in to the office, it takes them 20 minutes to get me back (even though I am perfectly on time for my appointment), and when I am leaving, another 20 minutes. I have to give them my insurance information every time I see them, even though I gave it to them to keep on file the last few visits.

Don't get me wrong: Dr. Angel is extremely intelligent and knows a lot about her profession. The dental hygienist I saw the last 3 visits was also very sweet and remembered me and took her time to get to know me, and she realized I was a returning customer. 

If you want a good cleaning and semi-annual check up, this is the office for you. But don't expect any type of customer service from the girls up front.",-1

I get it, it's a small location. 

Now, on the other hand, during a less busy time, I've had a great experience. The employees that normally man the counter are much nicer than the staff that works in the back (who happened to misdirect me several times during my first visit.) Hopefully, with more visits, I can bump this rating up. 

On a side note: It's a cute little building and it really gives you that small-town feel despite this being just about the only thing left in Higley. I know, it's kind of superficial, but it's somehow a plus. :)",1

So, you climb over the world's biggest boulders, sometimes with a wheel or two seemingly off the ground.  It's bizarre how you end up in the most awkward angles.  We also got the chance to take the Jeeps through the sand and do it ""dune buggy"" style.

I then had a roll but I cannot for the life of me remember the name. It was slightly tempura but delicious. Great size as well.

trn_6094,"The Poet Cafe is a Persian inspired cafe serving up Pilot Coffee as well as various breakfast, lunch, and pastry options. Located near Jarvis and King, this quiet cafe is a great addition the the neighbourhood.

I stopped by The Poet Cafe on a Saturday morning and was surprised at the beautiful decor and warm atmosphere that the interior created. The communal table at the front of the cafe was definitely a beautiful highlight as well as the various details on the walls and floor that made the place aesthetically pleasing (and Instagram worthy!). I walked up to the counter and was greeted by friendly smiling employees. Being told that they were also serving breakfast, I opted for an Americano as well as an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. After ordering I found myself a spot to wait for my food and drink to arrive (staff said that they would bring me my items). 

I got my Americano fairly quickly but it seems like the kitchen had a bit of a mix up and I had to wait a while for my egg and cheese sandwich. I wasn't in a rush and was spending some time alone so it didn't bother me that much. The staff were friendly and apologized for the mistake and also treated me to a free pastry (I'm not exactly sure what it's called but there were nuts in it and it was good!). When my sandwich came it was fresh and hot and the flavours were really unique. The spices they used together and the pita bread was certainly good. A different take on an egg and cheese sandwich. The americano I had was great as well, they certainly know how to make a good cup of coffee! 

Overall, except for the food mix up, the cafe delivers. It is a friendly and warm place you could spend a few hours working or have a quick bite to eat. They have a more extensive brunch menu on Sunday which looks amazing as well! Great place to check out if you are ever around the area.",1

No interest in really getting him involved in competitions or anything but he seems to like the class and his instructor.  The bad news is this place is super busy all the time with limited parking and it's standing room only...pretty much everywhere.  With multiple classes at once and one class ending 5 minutes before the next class starts, it's difficult for everyone to gather their child, head towards the door, and leave in an orderly fashion so the next group of parents can park and get in on time.  Wish that part could be rectified but a couple of 6 week sessions will be fun and beneficial for him.",0
trn_6106,"Ron, Tim and all of the service technicians at Advanced Auto Repair are the best auto mechanics I have ever worked with.  They are professional, friendly and above all excellent at what they do.

I drive a 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan that is modified to accommodate a wheelchair.  The modification system of the ramp failed and the closest service facility that works on this type of modification could not ""fit"" me in for over a week, Ron and his team stepped up.  

Even though this is not their area of expertise they figure the problem out and got it fixed. 

I have been coming to this service center for over two years, they excel at what they do, while auto repairs are always costly, they try to keep things as inexpensive as they can and will not try to sell you a service you do not need.

You cannot go wrong bringing your vehicle to Ron and Advanced Auto Repair.",1
trn_6107,"If you are looking for delicious fried chicken. This is the spot! Being from KY, we are selective on handing out the ""best fried chicken"" award. But this place is it! And their sauce on the spicy fried chicken is like no other. Mouth still waters from this place!",1
trn_6108,"Local gas station that is convenient, clean, and has some quick last minute snacks inside. The three stars reflect the auto wash. 

Interestingly enough, the car wash would seem to be high end with multiple stations, but overall the wash itself is just ok with water spots from poor drying to dust/ dirt left on the car. If this were a five dollar wash I would be happy, but considering I paid $13 bucks for the   ""extreme clean"" I expected more.  This does NOT include a vacuuming by the staff, but you can use their self serve vacuuming stations which work quit well.  

Overall, expensive car wash with self serve vacuum that costs 13 dollars.",0

trn_6114,"I had a similar experience that Amanda F. had. The first time I came here it was decent, i would have given this place 5 stars if it were like the first time each time. I had previously gone to the Tempe location and noted that this place seemed much more clean and organized. For your first time, or your return after being absent for a long time like myself, you go through the orientation which can take 3+ hours. After that, and a sort of physical (asking questions and blood test) they then start the actual process. The first time here was odd because they had to stick me twice. They said I needed to drink more water the next time I come in, must have been some dehydration issue. But eventually everything worked it...for this first time.

I came back the following weekend and was one of the first several people there. This time, they stuck me and messed up. They did it completely wrong because when it started returning blood it wasn't going into the right place but forming a ""bubble"" of blood in my arm! I had to holler out for them to take care of the issue. They then tried sticking me again but ""missed"", and started to basically try again and again like they were using my arm for practice. It was like they were guessing where my veins were and just poking in hoping to hit something. They quit once they noticed I wasn't liking this and had me lay down with some water and not return for a couple months. I haven't been back and don't ever intend to.

This place has given me a fear of needles that I never had before. Just a couple people know what they're doing. They all seem to be fresh out of school or something. Stay away!",-1
trn_6115,"I was in this bakery today and just wanted to say how well two of your managers handled and extraordinarily rude and disruptive woman. She came in with a very large dog that had no help vest on. When the manager (female) asked her for the permit for the dog the woman became absolutely irate and started berating her. She then proceeded to pour herself some coffee and realized the dispensers weren't full. A nice young lady replied that she was brewing coffee right now and that she could pour her some. The woman with the dog then proceeded to yell for her money back, saying this is ridiculous and that her manager should learn when to stop talking. 

Round two occurs between the female manager and the irate woman about the dog not having a vest on and the woman demands to talk to the owner/superior who could fire the woman. A male manager then steps out to talk to her and she is by no means any more calm. I would hate to see this manager lose her job for some Scottsdale house wife who couldn't be bothered to leave her dog out side a place where food is sold, especially when state law requires a vest on all help dogs. I've been here many times, the service has always been fantastic. I'm currently writing this review while eating my Turkey Waldorf salad (which is delicious by the way), hoping to do some good for a working woman who was treated so appallingly.",1

trn_6118,"I've been in here a couple of times now, and I fall more in love each time. I leave here feeling a longing to go right back. There's such an interesting variety of books, comics, and graphic novels cramped into the tiniest space I've ever experienced for a bookstore. It's a wonderful nook that makes me feel inspired just being there.

With that said, I recently found a few dirt-cheap novels from a British publishing company, as well as a pocket Rumi book. There's a few memoirs in graphic novel style that I am interested in too. There's always SOMETHING here that makes me excited to pick it up and read. 

Not only that, the people who work here are great.

The prices are great. Local bookshops have a hard time as it is, and Copacetic just doesn't price gouge, which I appreciate. 

The only downside/negative is that it's tedious for me to get here by bus. If it were any closer/easier, I would be here ALL OF THE TIME. It's worthwhile to come buy a book/comic or three, and head downstairs to Lili to sip on an amazing latte.",1
trn_6119,"I enjoyed this museum so much that shortly after the visit, I became a member.

Just the Hall of Architecture alone is worth the visit.  I don't believe that there is anywhere else in the world to see so many amazing plaster casts of architectural wonders.

Visit in the Christmas season to see amazing 20 feet tall trees themed to a current exhibit and the Neapolitan Presepio.  It is a stunning manger scene that was constructed between 1700 and 1835 with amazing detail.

There is a good mix of time periods and styles and I love the chronology approach to the galleries.   In fact, the only thing I don't enjoy is the Modern ""Art"".  Mostly because many of the pieces look like something I could have created myself.

Overall, one of the better art museums I've been to and well worth a visit while you are in Pittsburgh.",1
trn_6120,"Great karaoke, meh food.

I love going to this bar, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, when you can find the always sassy, and never dull David hosting karaoke; Offering the one of the largest collections of songs I have ever seen.

The atmosphere is touch and go. Some nights the bar is crowded with a 20-something college crowd, celebrating one milestone or another. At other times the crowd can be a bit older. The people are always nice.

The food is not great. I have ordered a few things off the regular menu, and am sorry to say I have never been satisfied. I highly recommend staying away from anything that has rice (I find it dry and under cooked) or anything with red curry chicken on it (overcooked and a mushy mouth feel). I have also had burned burgers, dry burritos that are more like wraps the burritos, and unseasoned chicken.

Don't bother complaining either. I made the mistake of saying I am not a fan of much on the menu and was met with sarcasm and told ""well everyone has their own taste"".
I totally agree with this, and I guess some people enjoy bland over cooked / under cooked food. 

I can highly recommend the late night menu, nachos, and the wings. 

Pros: Karaoke, good wings, close to subway
Cons: Inconsistent dinner menu",0
trn_6121,"What a fun store!  They have a wide variety of southwestern themed items for inside and outside the home.  I go about once a month to just browse because they frequently get new items.  The prices are reasonable and the owners and employees have always been very friendly and helpful.  

My husband likes the furniture in their space next door too.  They have household furniture that has a serious southwestern theme, and then they have fun stuff like a wooden bar or beer chest with the Corona logo on it.  Looks like something you'd find at a beachy bar in Mexico.  Wish we had lots of money to just go crazy in this place.",1

And, the sauce everything was tossed in was delicious! Sweet, spicy, savory and tangy all at the same time. My only complaint is the price point at $15.00 seems a little high for this dish. I'm a fan though and will be back for sure when I can afford to splurge!",1

I texted her telling her My lashes were super balled and asked if she was able to give me some more time to fill my lashes and she said she was booked and that I could only get the hour that I had originally scheduled. I wasn't upset and totally understandable. The problem didn't start until she was telling me that she was going to charge me for a full set because my lashes were so balled... even though I was only getting an hour of her time (where a full set takes 2 hours) and she admitted that my lashes would not be as full as a regular full set.... what I don't understand is why I am paying for a FULL SET when I am NOT getting the same amount of time or product as I would if I actually got a full set. I told her I agreed that my fill should be more expensive but asking me to pay for time and product I don't have is ridiculous. Let's just say, I didn't end up getting my lashes done by her at the end of the conversation.",-1

One bland, dry, uninspired omelette (how does a restaurant screw this up?) and one serving of french toast with ""fresh fruit"". Nothing but bananas and sliced apples. It's the middle of the summer in Montreal where neighbourhood fruit stores are overflowing with cheap fresh berries, mangos, peaches, etc... and my french toast is covered in bananas and apple? Talk about dry.

I assume they have decreased their staff over the years to help their bottom line.   When I have gone in there, you cannot find a sales person to help you in the computer department.   Once you do get someone, they are short and rushed and do not know the details of the technology.  They have became nothing more than a sales person.      Several years ago, Best Buy was the place to go as they would educate you on the purchase and you would leave there feeling like you at least made an informed decision.     Needless to say they are no longer training their employees on the details.     I ended up taking my three laptop purchase to FRY's because I could get my questions answered!",-1
trn_6127,"If you live in East York, then TCA is the gym for you! If you don't live in East York, good luck getting to TCA. 

LOCATION: 1/5
There's buses from Coxwell and Woodbine stations that drive past, but it'll take you an hour to get there. I've biked once or twice, and from Bloor/Yonge it's about a half hour. By car, it's in a rough spot, on the other side of the Taylor Creek bridge where O'Connor meets St. Clair. Even if you drive, it's no picnic getting there on a weeknight after work from the south (DVP north...eep) or west (Danforth during rush hour...yikes). Since this describes most working Torontonians, well...suffice it to say the location is less than ideal.

CROWDEDNESS: 5/5
There's lots of routes and there's usually not a lot of people (for reasons why, see: LOCATION) so you can generally climb to your heart's content, without waiting, on whatever routes you feel like at the exact time you feel like it. You could bring 'Tiny' your pet Elephant too, there's lots of room. 

SELECTION: 5/5
The routes don't change that often and there's lots of variety. This is to TCA's detriment for advanced climbers, since there's usually a glut of 5.6-5.9 level routes. For beginners and novices, this is the perfect place to climb.

TCA's greatest strength is its diversity of wall angles. There's lots of overhangs, steep climbs, straight climbs, and a few walls that change slant halfway up. My favourite is the cave, often requiring you to climb parallel to the floor before eventually getting to a really challenging overhang wall.

ROUTES: 4/5
The enjoyability of a route often depends on the hold colours. Their yellow/purple/blue holds can be really small, grainy and terribly painful. The orange/green/black/pink holds are generally pretty good. If you like to simulate what it's like to climb a really spiky painful outdoor route, then maybe this appeals to you! As far as design goes, I also find TCA's routes to be frequently engaging and challenging. 

BOULDERING: 5/5
TCA's has a great bouldering section. There's always lots of routes, they're labelled and graded fairly, and I always feel super confident about falling on the nice padded floor.

PRICE: 5/5
At 16 bucks, it's a fair value. The 10 pass (about  $140) expires in 6 months which is something I don't understand - you already have my money, why do you care how frequently I come? If I don't fulfill the 10 pass in time...well, I probably wasn't going to spend much more time at your gym anyways, right? On the other hand, if I'm a frequent climber, I'll easily use the 10 pass in time. But god forbid I don't...well, congratulations, you bilked some cash out of an otherwise good customer? Maybe someone can explain this to me. I'm baffled!

STAFF: 5/5
So far, TCA has the friendliest and most helpful staff I've found.

GENERAL FACILITIES: 3/5
To be fair, I probably haven't made great use of their amenities...from what I've seen there's only a stationary bike (maybe there's more gym equipment upstairs?) the change room is decent size, considering there's never a big crowd. Overall, not impressive, but you get what you need.

MUSIC: 3/5
The thought is nice, but no thank you, I do not need The Barenaked Ladies to score my climb. Why do so many gyms LOVE 90s rock/Canadiana? I don't get it. Please, climbing gyms, put more thought into your playlists! There's nothing more discouraging then being stuck on a rope and suddenly hearing ""eeeeeyiiit's been...one week since you looked at me!"" Nope nope nope no.",0
trn_6128,"Incredibly interesting menu items! Their pear bread they use for the grilled cheese it really good, and their salads are also well balanced and delicious. Generous portion sizes.

Just recently moved back to the area but this location looks new and clean. Receptionist and Dr Ian were great, and since It is right up the street from my work will be here often.",1
trn_6132,"The Atmosphere: Dark, modern, but welcoming. There are about ninety elevated flat screens, with every game and the omnipresent SportsCenter. The bar area is spaced out very well, so everyone is not right on top of one another. The bar is a good size wrap around type.

The Service: Excellent. Each time I've been in I've received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders. The managers greet customers as well, and the staff seems to be a great team.

The Food: Good. Nothing mind blowing, but above average. Fresh meat, good sauces, and good veggies. You don't come here for a culinary experience anyway, but you'll leave full and happy. 

The Drinks: Good prices even outside of happy hour. Small tap selection, but this is Gilbert. They have chilled mugs, which is cool. 

Overall: Blue 32 exceeds my expectations whenever I go in. All in all, it provides a cool sports bar contrast to the pub next door.",1
trn_6133,"**********TACO TUESDAY*********

My first ever Taco Tuesday was here.  Went with a LOT of rowdy people and the place was seemingly cool with the huge loud crowd, and even was able to seat us (I'm talking like 50 people).

I got a meal #27, don't remember exactly what it was but it included tacos and beans and was pretty epic-tasting.  The meal combo seemed so perfect that all of my friends got the #27 and loved it just as much.  However, my friend Greg did not get the #27 and was temporarily shunned for doing so. 

The chips are epic, as was the salsa and the interior decor.  

Also epic are their margaritas (and from what I remember, cheap too).  There is a seperate bar area you can go to get away from your crowd and order drinks.  Bar is especially cool because there are pictures of el guapo and wooden ships to look at while you order/drink.  

Cabs were ready and willing to take us back to the strip after we were finished eating.  I rode with chuckyhacks and it was fun.

trn_6137,"Finally checked out the downtown location tonight. Much funkier and quite a bit roomier than the Camelback location. Seemed to have a cute little patio but didn't get to explore much since it was so packed on First Friday. They had a DJ playing hip hop jams and anime going on the TVs so if the crowd doesn't bother you, it's an awesome place to chill with a sweet treat. And speaking of treats, the matcha combo cup was everything I have ever wanted in a frozen dessert: matcha snoh topped with red beans, condensed milk and little mochi balls. Bought a ""medium"" (they're huge) to share with the hubby but he wasn't a fan. I guess beans and ice cream aren't for everyone...

trn_6139,"NYNY's food court is modelled after Greenwich Village and is a breath of fresh air on the strip after experiencing the over-the-top excesses found in The Venetian, Caesar's Palace and Bellagio. Right in the middle of the ""Village Eateries"" you can find Greenberg's Deli. We walked in and encountered no line on a Friday afternoon in February. The help behind the counter was friendly and helpful and the sandwiches didn't take very long to prepare.

I couldn't resist the temptation to sample their foot long hot dog ($3.95) which came with potato salad. I also ordered a cup of Matzah ball soup ($3.50). My lovely wife opted for the Reuben sandwich (a whopping $9.50). A bottle of water ($2.50) and two draft Peronis ($5.25 apiece) rounded out the order. We sat ""outside"" on the sidewalk and dug in. The Reuben was monstrous with corned beef and sauerkraut spilling out beyond the edges of the insufficiently large slices of rye. I glanced down at the 12"" of wiener and large warm balls on my plate and was momentarily jealous of this impressive package.

Ref: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=lqw28h3QHm0LbOMuhv7lMw

I idly wondered how their ""Italian Stallion"" sandwich measured up. The jealousy didn't last for long. The Matzah ball soup lacked the ""schmaltzy"" flavor I was expecting and the dog was merely a very long but otherwise average dog. The Reuben was a bit better and possessed the girth the dog lacked. I did like their potato salad. The Peroni (served in an under-sized plastic cup) was cold and crisp and altogether unremarkable.

Without considering the price tag, this was quite a pleasant (although completely forgettable) three-star experience. However, the bill came to $32.27 and with it came raised expectations. The NYNY website states that the average check comes to $8-9 per person. Obviously, this is a figure that doesn't include alcohol. Give me a break!

One night 2.5 years ago, I was stuck at work, working the night shift, and all I wanted to do was to leave work early so I could go home and play with my dog who always makes me happy. It was time for a break and I walked into the break room and there it was... pizza from Angelina's. My boyfriend knew I wasn't having a good night so he decided to surprise me with comfort food. 

I like my pizza with extra cheese and that's it. I'll eat pizza with toppings too but I prefer extra cheese even though I pay the price an hour later... hehe.

I took a slice and I could tell right away I would like it. It wasn't too thick or too thin. Hmmm... I couldn't wait to take the first bite and when I finally did... OMG!   *sigh*
It hit the spot! It tasted like a New York style pizza and it was sooo good that I had three slices which is very rare for me.

The Dilla was Dillacious!!! I've never had a quesadilla like that before with chicken, serranos, grilled onions, sweet Thai chili sauce and jack cheese. It's their most popular Dilla and I can see why! So good and so filling! The churro was ok - it was filled with cajeta and I wasn't a fan of the filling but my hubby liked it.

I would definitely go back again.",1
trn_6155,"I LOVE the free games and they had a pretty decent beer selection. We definitely will be back. HOWEVER, the website says that they have food and Yelp reviewers show pictures of awesome looking grub when in actuality they only have a few prepackaged gas station treats. Chips, candy, popcorn etc. we planned to eat dinner before playing games so this was a HUGE bummer especially when everywhere online leads you to believe that there will be food. Also, it was also a bummer the all the games that I like to play cost money. Only my husband plays the video games while I prefer pinball, skeeball, and air hockey.",0
trn_6156,"Service - 5 star, inviting, knowledgable, Actually seems to care about your experience.

Food - 5 star, my girl friend and I ordered the chefs choice and it was packed with unique and delicious flavours from the appetizers to the dessert. ( the broccolini and the dumplings were insane).

Ambience - 5 star, perfect for a date night very quaint and the lighting was perfect, also a plus they were not blasting rap (great for the gym or a club not so great for a date). the service also added to the ambience of the place to make it feel very inviting.",1
trn_6157,"Wife wanted a new tattoo so a quick look on Yelp and off we went to here.

They have all the standard flash on the walls that you find everywhere, including Sailor Jerry. Place is very clean, as it should be.

Neighborhood is a bit ""special"" but oh well.

Wife is an artist so she drew the outline her own tattoo. Karl did a great interpretation of what she wanted. It came out even better than expected. Price was in the range of what I thought it would be, slightly higher than other places in the area, but worth it.",1
trn_6158,"It's surprising to see the 5-star reviews of this place. Not that it's bad, but it's not worthy of 5-stars. You come here for the quirkiness and the big plates of diner food. The service can be hit or miss - sometimes they are on their A game, other times you never see your waitress. Adding to this is having to wait on a cocktail waitress to order drinks. 

Good Highlights:
I appreciate being able to order a fresh salad from a diner. Their Southwest Salad is huge and tasty. 

Front door parking

Kid-friendly

Diverse menu - something for everyone

Bad Highlights:
Hit or miss service

Fireside Lounge - If you don't smoke or hate being around smoke, then it's impossible to have a cocktail in their Lounge. I had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. It was super bad.

Just a general observation for Vegas newbies:
I see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. FYI - This is what I like to call the Vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in Vegas. Everything is more expensive here, even diner food. If you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in Vegas. If you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. You're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high. A $29 ribeye on the strip IS a steal.",0

And I have never been to a Chinese restaurant with absolutely no combinations. I mean really?! To top it off the sesame chicken was dry and the sauce was not mixed well and I could see the guminess from the thickener ugh. No need to waste your time or hard earned mo,-1
trn_6161,"The delivery service that they advertise thru postdates is a joke and a ripoff.  Twice we have ordered home delivery and both times they have failed to include dishes that we ordered and paid for. How a restaurant this inept can stay in business is beyond me. The food was also mediocre at best, but at least we expect to get what we paid for.  When we call to complain about the incomplete orders, their is a lack of enthusiasm and concern about correcting the incompetence involved.    Perhaps the owner should have stayed in the pharmaceutical business, since he obviously cannot run a restaurant enterprise. How hard is it to package what people order online and deliver it????",-1
trn_6162,"Absolutely among the best bagels I've ever had- as others have noted, a nice combination of Montreal and NY style.

The Good:

The Bad: 
- Not a fan of bathroom doors that cant be locked and have a huge gap in the middle where u can clearly see inside lol
- Not a huge fan of the actual casino.. probably just cuz i have bad luck there lol hopefully that changes

Venetian and Palazzo are def always at the top of my list in places to stay but i still prefer the mirage over anything else...",1

The ingredients - rice, seaweed, raw fish - taste fresh to me (which is not true at every restaurant I've been to). The wait service is decent speed, and the restaurant is small and cozy. The menu has a comfortable selection of sushi, hand rolls, teriyaki, other things I forgot, and a small handful of dessert items.

Owners and employees appear to be Cantonese-speaking.",1

trn_6172,"Ce fut aujourd'hui une expérience décevante. Je fréquente les Resto Arahova depuis près de 35 ans et je sens que la fin approche pour cette succursale à moins de donner un coup de barre rapidement. J'avais ressenti la même chose il y a quelques années avec la succursale sur la rue Sherbrooke est quand la qualité avais diminuée, il a fermé peu après.
Les calmars étaient mous, peu ou pas égoutés, et la sauce était dans un plat de plastique pour emporter. Le fromage fêta est sec et manque de saveur et la salade grecque devient par le fait même bien insignifiante. Le seul point positif est notre serveur, Claude, qui est gentil et efficace. En ce dimanche midi, alors que le St-Hubert voisin est plein, nous étions durant tout notre repas les seules personnes dans le Resto. Quand les clients désertent, le message est clair .
C'est triste mais pour moi, Arahova, c'est terminé.",-1
trn_6173,"Was so looking forward to this! It was not at all what I expected. It's not a sit down restaurant with servers, you wait in line to order at a counter and then have to hunt for a table. They only have a counter and maybe 2 tables but the Cosmo has a dining area right next to it with more tables and benches. We arrived around 1pm on a Monday and had to wait in line about 20 minutes. I ordered the slut which was tasty but very small for the price. I would def opt for a breakfast sandwich next time for cheaper. It was a much larger person, my friend loved hers. The orange juice was also nice and fresh.",1
trn_6174,"My boyfriend and I were going to eat at this restaurant even after reading some of the negative reviews for this place. When we got to the door, we noticed how run-down this place was although they've only been there for a year.  Upon entering, it was very bright and had cafeteria-styled seating to the right, rows of sofas for hookahs on the left, a giant bar at center, and was not-at-all busy for a Friday night. There was one waitress as far as we could tell, who was confused by why we were there, ""are you here to stay for dinner, or...?"" We were seated, began reading the menu, and everything was quite expensive.  We decided based on the ambiance to go to the amazing fondue and crepe place just across the parking lot.",-1
trn_6175,"This place is a parents oasis. Great set up. Just wish the parent lounge area was bigger and had more seating for weekends. Also more cubby holes. Also felt as though the art and crafts are should be in one of those seperate side rooms, so crayons aren't on the floor everywhere. Staff was amazingly pleasant. Playground was safe, and cushioned.  I would take the nail area out and add more massage chairs parents rend to hogg them. Should be wipes near by to wipe down chairs doe sanitary purposes. All and all a great place for kids to be themselves!",1
trn_6176,"This is an excellent buffet.  We had dinner here tonight.  I loved the Kobe sirloin, the mushroom ravioli with truffle pieces, and the roast lamb.  There was also some good salmon poke and jumbo peeled shrimp.  

The food items are laid out in a nice order and they're easily accessible.  Of course, what would dinner be without mentioning desserts.  That is why we eat, no?  I had a dark chocolate, raspberry cone (a mini chocolate ice cream cone filled with creamy dark chocolate and fresh raspberries) and Key Lime tart.

I would have given the buffet 5 stars except our server was quite slow despite the fact he didn't appear to have that many tables.  Iced tea refills were slow and he was slow to clear plates.

I'll be back again to eat some of the things I didn't get to today like split crab legs, ahi poke, and some more of their excellent seafood dishes.",1

trn_6184,"Unlike anything else in Pittsburgh! From the minute you arrive until you leave this place will blow you away.

Upon arrival you stop to order at what appears to be the bar area. It's kind of Smallman Galley (ish) where you order and pay at the counter before choosing your own seat with a table number. You can review the menu before arriving, but honestly the hostess did such a fabulous job explaining everything just go with it. The line never went down and even with people breathing down our backs to order the hostess never made us feel rushed. She was so sweet and took care in making recommendations and explaining our best choices to cater to my nut allergy. 

Per the recommendations we ordered three items: Boczniaki z kapusta, the Perogi and the Kluski Slaskie. We also each had a drink. Marissa had the Becherovka, house tonic & burnt lemon and I had the Fernet, scotch, apple cider. I took one look at the drink menu and had no idea what to order so I let the staff pick for me! I am in no way a scotch drinker, but I loved this drink! I was still skeptical when it arrived at the table I wasn't sure what to expect. It was incredible. One of my favorite drinks in Pittsburgh. Go out on a limb and try it! 

We waited no time at all for our order. I'd be surprised to say it took even 15 minutes. The dishes are presented beautifully. We split all three items and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The Boczniaki z kapusta was by far my favorite dish. The mushrooms are roasted perfectly and the butternut sauce tops if off. The Klushi Slaskie dumplings are a bit flavorless on their own. With the help of the sauce they are magical. 

If you are planning your visit be sure to ask for recommendations. The staff is super knowledgeable and kind. You will not be disappointed.",1

Some of the exhibits are very amusing and not very scientific at all but that's okay, it's for kids.

The spinning pole display was questionable but maybe I have my mind in the gutter.",1

So far so good, I am very happy with Wes and taking care of me and my car. The only reason for the 3 stars is because I got a complimentary wash (all lexus cars get these) and for some reason they missed the large black tar spot on the bottom of my car right below the driver side door. I was hoping it was obvious enough for them to take care of (for I didnt wash it off knowing I would get a car wash that day) When I got home I had to clean it off.

I had made an appointment for my hard of hearing 76 yr old dad in June. I wish I was there to help him but I live in a different state.  (He drove by the Smoke Ranch location the day before just so he knew where it was and not be late).  The morning of the appt. he arrived early as instructed only to be told he DID NOT have an appointment. The 3 front desk personnel were RUDE, unprofessional and they made my dad feel disrespected as they giggled and carried on.  No one attempted to show they cared.
I contacted and maneuvered my way into their phone prompts and extension and managed to talk to the very front desk person.  According to her she claims that the office had tried to contact my dad (and sent a letter!) stating that his appt. needed to be rescheduled.  My dad received no such communication.

trn_6196,"Steak places are a dime a dozen on the strip so why would someone go to Outback?  I mean just next door their is Smith & Wollensky's and across the street is Mastro's Ocean Club not to mention Craftsteak and Striphouse all within a 5 iron shot of the place.  But what if you don't want to break the bank?  All of the aforementioned joints require most people to take a second mortgage out to afford.  Therein lies the beauty of Outback.  You can go in and get a delicious steak at a reasonable price (around 20 bucks) with decent sides and a casual atmosphere.

That's exactly how I found myself at this particular Outback the other night.  My cousin was in town and staying on the strip.  We wanted to get in touch with our carnivore roots but didn't want to have to sleep in our car as result.  Looking out from her room at the Monte Carlo, we spied Outback next to the giant Coke bottle and over-sized M & M (only in Las Vegas!).  We ambled across the strip and found the Outback to be tucked away adjacent to the Coke World shop and requiring an elevator ride to reach the host stand.  Once upstairs your removed from the hustle and bustle of the strip and can settle into a nice meal.  We were immediately seated even though the place was jumping and drink orders were taken promptly.  After perusing the menu I wasnt sure if this Outback was a little more expensive than others because of its location or if all of them how have raised their prices recently because I did notice the prices inching up higher than I last recalled.  They were still reasonable however and I ordered the Outback special which is a 12oz Sirloin and my cousin got the Prime Rib.  Both cuts were cooked right to order and the accompanying salad and potato were more than sufficient.  I loved that our waitress recognized my insatiable thirst of diet Coke and kept a steady stream of pops heading my way,  

There was a nice view overlooking the strip from the restaurant and while the space was loud we could have a conversation without any problems.  This Outback is the perfect choice for people visiting Vegas and wanting a good substantial meal without all the production of a fancy ""casino"" restaurant.  Plus it'll save you some bucks so you can eventually loose it on a slot machine later in the night....or on the Indianapolis Colts as was the case with me....",1

5/28/13-  I gave this place another try and I am so glad I did.  I had one of the better tasting chicken burritos I have ever had.

Hubby and I split the Shrimp Scampi Risotto that was super lemony and fresh as well as the Chicken Scallopini which was like the best chicken parmesan with savory sauce EVER. We topped the meal with the Chocolate Bar; a chocolate mousse with cherry chip ice cream that was incredible.

Oh, wait.  The term, ""never again"" commonly refers to the holocaust, not this restaurant.  But seriously...

One night, I thought, what the hell, pizza from the best, right?  Pizza Margarita, $10-$15.  So I go, and I ask, ""...can you add sausage and mushroom?"", and the guy says sure.  I'm not kidding you: $5 DOLLARS FOR SAUSAGE, $3 FOR MUSHROOMS...ON A $10 PIZZA.

I checked two pizza parlors, at random, who have owners without Chrissy Bianco's ego, and for an 18"" pizza, to add sausage, they charge $1.75.  A dollar seventy five!  But not Bianco!  FIVE DOLLARS!  

Listen, I've made money, had money, lost money; it's my opinion that $5 for sausage on a 10-12"" pizza is pure narcissism.  It's just silly.  And I'll never, EVER come back.

 They also make the best Iced Mochas i have ever had. I've watched them being made and i just can't figure out why--i see the plain old Hershey's syrup going in, but there has GOT to be something else in that bottle. 

The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they never even bat an eyelash when i ask for my salad in a to-go box and I'm not to-going (because i like to put the yummy balsamic in it, close the lid, and shake it).

I got the Green Tea crepe which was filled with red bean, sponge cake and green tea ice cream. I also tried the Caffe Latte which arrived with really pretty latte art! Both were delicious and enjoyable. The crepe was especially fresh and tasty. 

The service was casual but friendly. Clean washrooms. Prices were OK. I definitely would go back to try the other items on the menu.",0
trn_6215,"We recently moved in to our new home two weeks ago.  The previous owners had two large dogs and the carpets had a very strong odor and numerous traffic stains in the living room and master bedroom.

Gene and Berto arrived on time and toured my home to make sure all of my concerns were addressed and promptly went to work.

The next day, I was simply amazed with the work that they did.  They got all of the traffic stains out and left the house smelling really good.

My wife had concerns about the doggie smell that returned later that day and a stain that appeared in the dining room (possibly due to movers).  I called Sam to have someone investigate my wife's concern and to clean our oversized lounge chair.

Jacob came out to the appointment on time and really listened to our concerns about the smell and mystery stain.  He educated me about the finer points about odors, stains, and proper treatment.  Man, he really knew his stuff!  He promptly went to work cleaning the carpet, deodorizing the downstairs and working on our chair.  This man is a multi-tasking genius!  He was very meticulous, and paid close attention to detail.

The house smells wonderful, all the stains are gone, and our chair is back to its original condition!

Noble Carpet Cleaning, they are the real deal.  They take their time to listen to their customers and provide A+ service!  I will definitely be calling them back for routine cleaning and recommending them friends and family!  Thank you for making our house clean and comfortable for me and my family!",1
trn_6216,"This was my second experience with an escape room. We did the bomb diffusal and Las Vegas room. We had a Groupon which they let us apply to both rooms as we originally only went in for one room. Clean, complex puzzles, good use of atmosphere and themes. Rooms are on the classic, ""simpler"" side, in both cases the escape was single room only. Mainly numbers, locks, passwords, keycodes. Limited use of devices, technology, and mechatronics. Would go back to try and solve the remaining rooms.",1

Everything takes so synthetic and there is no way that is real whip cream in their pastries. The black sesame cheesecake is just vile had to spit it out. The matcha cream puff is not even the right choux pastry texture. The caramalized sugar croissant was like some weird bastardized version of the classic, texture and taste was just so off and weird. Prices match top quality French patisseries but the cheap chemical-like ingredients are worse than the cheapest Chinatown bake shop.",-1

trn_6221,"I just want everyone to know:
Central Phoenix, a city of 1.5 million people, has exactly three private plant sellers: Whitfill Nurseries, SummerWinds Nurseries and Moon Valley Nurseries.   

So support this place before all you have left is Home Depot. 

After the Baker's closing, I had to find myself a new nursery. I can't tell you how sad that made me. I refuse to buy plants from big box stores.

I've been to Summerwinds twice now, and each time a lovely woman has been so friendly and helpful. I am new to this whole plant thing and mainly stay in the hard to kill zone, but I have no problem finding answers to all my newbie questions here. The staff is even willing to indulge me and look at pictures on my phone of my sad rubber plant with one straggling leaf. 

Although Summerwinds doesn't have the same feeling the Baker's grounds had (because Baker's was a legitimate oasis in the desert), it does have the best pottery section. Their glazed ceramic pots are beautiful and everything is incredibly organized. 

Bottom line, it's so easy to find what you need, just go already. Oh, and if you're lazy, they will even pot your plants for you. You don't even have to get your hands dirty.",1
trn_6222,"I love the Pickled Peach! The food is all farm to table, and there is actually a chalkboard that tells you which farm produced each ingredient in every option. I highly recommend the ham/brie/pickled peach sandwich. It's goey and has the savory sweet complex flavor that makes you wish you could rewind time and eat it again when you've finished. Their homemade soups and salads are always delicious, and they offer vegetarian and gluten free options. Located in Davidson, it's a quaint lunch spot with a big flavor punch.",1

My first impressions were that this place stays packed! My goodness the parking lot was a bit crazy. But after finding a park and walking around I begin to realize why....this place has so much to offer! 

I loved that there were a good mix of stores and boutiques for you to window shop or browse and find some great deals! There's also a movie theatre and book store which add a nice touch! And if you're anything like me, the food options are a big priority and here they offer more than enough choices! I was impressed with the amount of variety they offered. And yes, there's ice cream too!  

It's the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon or a lazy Sunday just wondering around. If I'm on this side of town again I wouldn't mind stopping by here again!",1

First impression - walked-in to a nice open lobby, and, was nicely greeted by the Front Desk.  
Now.....at 3:30pm in the afternoon......not having any rooms ready??  Come on.  We had a Wedding to get ready for, and, my wife used the Lobby washroom to start.  They recovered quickly.  We had a room within 15 minutes.  
The hotel is still new, and, working out some kinks I believe. 
Gorgeous room.  L-Couch (comfy), small kitchenette, big windows, and, a rainfall shower.  If I was out of town travelling for business, I would be VERY happy with a room like this to return to.  Much better than a standard hotel room.

We had the pulled pork sandwich and BBQ beef brisket tacos, both of which were great, but it was the baked mac & cheese that stole the show! It was the best we've ever had. Don't miss their mexicorn, it's awesome too. And the slaw was perfect.

trn_6230,"This was the only salon around that actually takes walk ins. All the other salons say they do but usually they make you make an appointment to come back later. It was very frustrating for me because I needed a quick fix and was on a very tight schedule.

When I walked in, the ladies there were very nice and welcomed me. I just wanted a haircut and it was $20, which was exactly my budget. The place was very clean and it looked nice. 

One of the ladies, Janelle was the one to cut my hair and she was really friendly. She took a while to cut my hair but it was because she was trying to make sure I was completely satisfied....and I was. I'm very happy with my hair and this was the best side bang cut I was ever given! I'm usually not super happy with my bangs at other places but now I'm very proud to show them off.

What I really appreciated though was the way they dealt with my friends. I had a group of three come along with me and I'm sorry to say they were a little embarrassing and fussy about getting drinks. The ladies dealt with them very professionally and happily and got them all what they wanted even though they weren't the ones getting cuts. They even talked to all of them so I had a pretty good time!

Overall I'm very happy with this place!

trn_6244,"I live in the neighbourhood and have enjoyed having a resto/pub nearby for both business meetings and also social get togethers. I have been coming here since Merchants opened and have enjoyed both the service and the food.

The reason for the bad review however is that we came in on a Saturday night with a group of 16 adults. (all between 40 and 50 yrs.) to have dinner and drinks. Probably a $2000 tab for the evening. We were seated as we arrived and the server asked the first group seated to not move the tables. As people arrived they ended up pushing tables together. When the server returned to the group with menus, she lost her temper and spoke in a very derogatory manner to all 16 in the group and then went and complained about us to the supervisor.

The issue in the end is that the server felt that we had crossed a line by moving one table 3 inches to a point where she was going to treat us like a group of preschoolers and then complained about us to the manager. At that point we decided to leave and go to a nearby pub which welcomed us with open arms.

The manager at Merchants treated the issue as a non issue and seemed to be fine with our party leaving. In the end it was a disrespectful and confrontational response that forced us out. Never going back and it's likely that none of the others will either.",-1

From Me:
You know what, Sam?  My uncle paid for the Groupon.  And guess what?  That was paid with money.  When you went into contract with Groupon, you agreed to take less than the amount you typically charge.  That gives you no reason to be rude to customers or former customers.  In fact, you should have apologized when you read my reply about insulting me.

As with other narcissists, you don't seem to know when you aren't being insulted and just take constructive criticism for what it's worth.  Again, I did not insult your business, your employees, or you in my initial review.  I just wanted people to realize that they may not be afforded the same privacy that I had received when the business is busier - with not having doors.  In fact, I felt I was doing you a service by telling people that the bad reviews were wrong.  You should have been happy with the review.  

Now it's obvious by your two replies that English is not your first language.  I understand that.  And so perhaps you did not know you were being given a good review (not great, mind you, but not bad).  So I'll forgive your misunderstanding.  But to insult me by calling me a pervert, insulting my parents and/or behavior (who are fabulous), and my financial status (I do quite well BTW) is beyond forgivable.  

I hope your business goes bankrupt due to your behavior on this site.  Grow up, take some constructive criticism, and try to be a good businessman and learn that word of mouth is important.  If you insult every customer that has a suggestion then you will soon have so few your door will no longer remain open.",-1
trn_6252,"Cute, cute, cute!  This very nice little store is a wonderful place to visit.  

As is evident in their name, they sell cheesecakes, and they sell crime novels.  

The store is laid out neatly, with the mystery books on one side, and the coffee bar on the other side.  The cheesecakes are all homemade, and they are excellent.  No, really, they're incredibly great.  And, as a sort of added bonus, they can make you any cheesecake you'd like, and not just the traditional ones.  One of my favorites was a tortilla chip, jalapeno, and chorizo cheesecake!  It was incredibly delicious!  I haven't seen it since that first time, but I'm sure he could make it again if requested!  

The coffee at first was kind of lackluster.  The latte was burnt and a little too bitter, the tea was really weak and somewhat flavorless, and the soy mocha wasn't made with soy milk.  After a while they got much, much better!  Perhaps they trained their staff in coffeemaking and got some good quality coffee, but in any case, great improvement.

The mystery novel selection is good, though of course it can't really be nearly as good as a large bookstore like Barnes and Noble.  If you're looking for something in particular, either call ahead, or just get it at a bigger store.  This store is more of a browser shop for people who aren't looking for something specific, just looking for something.  That being said, they also have a good selection of graphic novels and children's books as well, and I was very surprised about that.  There are many books by local authors, as well, and this is the place for small group meetings and book clubs!  Small bookstores like this really need to build a sense of community in order to be successful in this day and age, and C&C is doing its very best to do that.

Finally, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the atmosphere is a little uncomfortable at times.  It doesn't seem like a place to spend a long time reading, or to get lost in.  There's no music.  It's either completely silent or there's a movie playing that most of the time I'm just not interested in.  

Recommended place, but come and go, and not to hang out.",1
trn_6253,"I believe this small coffee shop is suffering from the economic slow-down, which is a shame. The offerings are nothing spectacular but I hate to see locally-owned businesses suffer. I have been in the shop about 5 times in the last couple weeks at what should be peak times, but the place was dead and often I was the only customer. Being set so far back from Gilbert Rd. probably isn't helping their cause.

Their signature drink the Shark Bite is your basic caffeine-infused cold beverage. If you like coffee and you need a shot of caffeine, you will find none better. However their menu is difficult to follow - you're kind of on sensory overload when your standing there at the counter and the guy is waiting to take your order. Still, service is good and they are friendly.

The shop has a small conference room which is great for conducting small meetings or interviews, if you don't mind the Christmas tree box in the corner. They also have massage chairs, computer workstations and free Wi-Fi. If you're looking for somewhere to spend your  money other than Starbucks, the Coffee Cove is a good option for you.",0
trn_6254,"My wife met someone from here at a chamber of commerce (I think, may have been a WSD meeting) meeting last year, so when I became sick, I thought I would give them a call.  I called 5-7-18 and left a message.  A lady called me back finally this morning and I told her that I had left a message Monday.  She explained that she was out since Monday, (which I guess means if she is out, no one answers the phone or returns phone calls).  When I explained that I was no longer interested, she said ""yeah, well bye"" and hung up.  

Yeah, well bye Dr Scott Lamprecht.  I will never know if you are a good doctor or not.  Your staff should recognize that this is a doctors office, not a fast food establishment, and when someone is calling due to being ill, if you cannot answer the phone, a timely return call is, at least, a requirement.
Edit
I just talked to a co worker who said the same lady called my office first looking for me.  My co worker said she could provide my cell number and the girl said ""I don't know why he is calling us"" My co worker again offered my cell and the girl said yeah, ok, whatever.

trn_6269,I really like to thank the phoenix police dept for all their help in helping us with a apartment building  that has  had many issues.  we have made progress  and have cut down on vandalism/theft/trespassing/squaters  etc . We could of not done it with out you . It seemed like everyday  we were calling you for assistance and each time you  responded you were courtesy/professional/concern and offered great customer service. we worked as a team to  transform this apartment building to  a better place to live for our  tenants. we will be forever thankful .Even when we did not call you  u were in the area patroling. Once again thank you so much . You are appreciated and respected . Joyce m,1
trn_6270,This place is great! Offers awesome prices even when I told them I found something private party cheaper they gave me a good outlook and helped me not over pay for a used gun. Always helpful and knowledgeable. I've been in a couple times for smalls parts and ammo but always dream of the guns I want and they are patient and let me hold any of the guns knowing I'm just dreaming at the time. Definitely suggest this place over the other couple of places I've been here in vegas even though this place is on the complete other side of town from me this is always my first stop!,1
trn_6271,"Not listening to a fellow Yelp'r (Tiffany N.) I took it upon myself to try this place out hoping for the best.  But....it fell flat.  First off, I prefer the do it yourself style of TCBY and a few other places.  Also, there were only like 5-6 flavors?  Meh.  

Another no-no for me was that this is another fro yo place that is based on the tart style yogurt that I am not a fan of.  

All things being equal I have to say the salty caramel flavor I tried wasn't half bad but it was like choosing the lesser of two evils.

I will say I do like this location though, nice fountain outside to sit and enjoy your yogurt at the end of the day.",-1

trn_6274,"First time reviewer for Yelp... just had to repeat what all the other reviews have said--Biaggio's is the best pizza and sandwiches around!!  Biaggio's rates number 1 in Nevada on Yelp and for good reason... Biaggio really does have the best New York style pizza and sandwiches in all of Las Vegas!  Not that I've tried ever other restaurant, but have tried almost all of the ""top 10""  in LV and Biaggio was my favorite.  My brother and I tried the white pizza, the Philly Cheesesteak and the garlic knots with Biaggio's signature marinara sauce.  All were terrific, as other reviewers can attest.  I'm a huge fan of marinara sauce, and you won't find a better sauce elsewhere!  My brother and I got a chance to talk to the owner for awhile about his restaurant and felt at home, we've never been treated friendlier.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed!",1

trn_6277,"The manager, Melissa, was amazing. So professional, so gracious, and she took excellent care of my friend and me. Thank you so much! Also her suggestion of the Peruvian Doughnuts was a great one, perfectly-paired with our Samba Split (only the most amazing banana split ever created--seriously, caramel popcorn!!!). 
Big thumbs-up to their pastry chef, Jai, as well. Melissa might have shepherded us to our dessert choices with poise and class rarely found in a Las Vegas establishment, but Jai's care with the preparation of our sumptuous desserts was nothing shy of brilliant. He really raised the bar with his flawless presentation of both desserts. Beautiful, indulgent, simple, crafty. He allowed the dishes to speak for themselves, and they spoke loudly. In my mouth!  He even came to greet us personally.  And I'm pretty sure there was an extra scoop of ice cream in there. Kudos to the Sushi Samba staff for all their excellent service this evening!!! Thank you!!",1
trn_6278,"Nice and dark, old school, with the smell of garlic bread, 
and a mishmash kitschy decor of a Chotchkie's apron with flair, 
the place is oddly perfect for a romantic date night, 
a family dinner that pleases everyone, 
or a raucous party (the endless wine helps). 

The portions are huge and yummy.  
My lasagna was so cheesy it was like queso fundino with sauce.  
My wife's cannelloni was a bucket of fresh ricotta wrapped in a pasta blanket. 
 My sister's sausage (wasn't that a CBS show?) was yum.  
We ate for a long time and it looked like we never started.  
Make sure your room has a fridge.  
And we ended up with uneaten garlic bread.  
Who doesn't finish off a basket of garlic bread?  
I mean, besides the Lost Boys. 

Oh, and personally I'm glad the endless wine isn't super awesome wine. 
I don't like wine, but this stuff was slightly watery and slightly flat 
so I was able to throw it down.

Hey, here comes Gordy, the accordion player!  
He's like a mariachi band only it's one guy, I understand the words, 
and I don't shrink in my seat when he comes by.  
Keep a fiver in your pocket to give him - 
the guy will need a second hip soon.

The service is great, too.  I didn't like much my minestrone soup. 
 It had, like, every vegetable in it.  
I could point out so many it was like a Richard Scarry book.  
So I asked if I could get the salad (mmm with a slice of salami) instead.  
""No problem!""   
Can we get more garlic bread?  
""Sure, please make room for a shoebox size basket of garlic bread"".  
Hey, since this wine is endless, can I leave my car here?  
""Please do.  Would you like us to fill it with garlic bread?""

Oooh, and that hot chocolatey cappuccino at the end w/ whipped cream!
Nothing's better on a stomach full of 2 pounds of cheese 
and a gallon of wine than some hot liquid chocolate coffee.
Keep your leftovers so you have something to eat while you're in the bathroom :)",1
trn_6279,"Sandwiches and wraps are definitely good (just make sure to tell 'em to ease up on the sauce). Beer selection is nice. Name is awesome. Service is nice but can be painfully slow. Came for a quick lunch on a Friday, right at noon, and there was no one in front of us but still took 20 minutes for the guy to make a sandwich, no real reason, just taking his jolly ol' time.

They don't have a lot of options on the menu when it comes to fried chicken....Despite the name...

The chicken comes with fries and radishes. The meat is tender and juicy, and the skin with thin and crisp. The fries were pretty good as well.

trn_6297,Bearded bar staff sucks. Cant smile. New owners I think. Whole staff is about raking your money. The old faithful (large) crowd has left. The food sucks now. THEY USED TO COOK STEAKS ON A GRILL OUTSIDE. Surely losing money and soon to change owners. Go at your own risk.,-1
trn_6298,"Of the non-chain Mexican food places in my area, this is the closest to where I live but it took me a few years to finally try it out. That's because it doesn't have the flashy signs and banners that the other places have, and because the small, somewhat run-down building fades into the background of the countless business and food establishments in the area. But while it serves standard small Mexican food joint fare, the food here is good; not exactly fast food, as it took a while for me to get what I ordered, but the quality is a tad above that of the ubiquitous 'Berto-type  restaurants of the Valley.",1

trn_6306,"My appliance horror story started out six days before Christmas.  I notified my home warranty company that my fridge was not cooling and they dispatched their contract technician out to take a look.  He diagnosed the problem as a blown compressor.  Three days drag by and coming to find out they don't work on an R12 sealed system.  It's Christmas now and we have a houseful of company.  Fast forward and it's the 28th now and still no word what is going on.  I asked to speak to a supervisor of the contracted company and they blew me off and later would hang up on me!  I got back in touch with my warranty company and they said if I could find someone to work on my fridge they would pay for the repair since none of their contractors work on this type of system.  So I hit Yelp and called Elite Pro.  Rachelle was extremely helpful and an hour later Ronald was at my house.  He diagnosed the problem as a blown relay and in half an hour Ronald and Elite Pro had us up and running.  My problem was misdiagnosed by someone either poorly trained or looking to make money on a $2,000 compressor repair!  It took me waiting 12 days without a fridge and Elite Pro had me up and running in less than two hours from the time I made the call.  The whole thing cost about 10% what a compressor would have  AWESOME!  My home warranty company and that contract company could learn a thing or two from Elite Pro Appliance Repair Services!  These guys are honest and have my highest recommendation!",1

I went to watch a friend who was shooting and was very disgusted with the treatment those of us watching received. We were kicked out of the range. Not nicely either. Then the city of Las Vegas guy called compound bow shooters cry babies because they had hung the wrong targets. It's about rules. The rules called for certain targets. People practiced on those certain sized targets. Very unprofessional. And because they couldn't double up on the bails they had to move other people's times that were shooting later and they had to cancel birthday dinner plans all because they couldn't handle the shoot. Owner of Aces and arrows wears his hat like an immature child and has chew in his mouth and spitting in a water bottle in front of EVERYONE. (I'm being nice). Really?

As usual the service was slow but they were very friendly and nice.  We were the ONLY Asians in there for sure, but hey I like my Ethiopian food! ^_^ It's a nice low key.  You can get a lot of food for a very good price.  There are some stuff that was really good and some were so-so.  I did like the Tibs because it was just fried and flavored.  Yum!

We almost went to SumoMaya or one of the other places we knew about, but I'm so glad we picked Tottie's instead. It is so delicious, and you get a ton of food for the price. We normally eat a lot, but we still have another meal's worth of food leftover (if not more!). 

We got the Vegetable Fried Rice, Sesame Chicken and Soft Shell Crab with Curry. The plate of fried rice was humongous; we'll probably be able to have leftovers of this more than once. It was very well flavored and had a ton of veggies in it. The curry was also great, and it came in a huge bowl! The crabs were cooked very well. I'm not huge on that kind of seafood, but I still enjoyed it. The Sesame Chicken was my favorite - fried and crispy, and they had a perfect amount of sauce on it. A lot of places seem to leave their chicken too saucy or too bland, so that was great. 

We'll definitely be going back here again, or will probably order it in the next time we want Asian food :) I would definitely recommend this place next time you're in the mood for Asian!!

The best part is that its surprisingly very vegetarian friendly because in many of the sandwiches you can substitute a tofu or soy product.  My favorite thing to get is their wet hot buffalo chicken grilled cheese. The fake chicken they use in the sandwich is the best I have ever had and tastes most similar to the real thing. Not only that but the combination of flavors is incredible! 

Also, even though the sandwiches cost more than usual, it feeds you for two meals. I always take half my sandwich, fries, and slaw home (since they give you so much) and eat that the next day. It actually reheats fairly well too. But the main point is you won't go home hungry and there will be plenty of yummy leftovers!",1

trn_6338,"Pretty decent, for an airport restaurant.  I had fish tacos, filled with tons of slaw and large pieces of fish.  The fries were crispy and hot.  It was pretty slow service, but we didn't mind, as we had 3 hours until our flight.  And it was understandable, because the restaurant was packed!  I guess if you're short on time you could ask them if they would be able to accommodate.  My only complaint was that my beer was lukewarm, and I couldn't finish it.  But everything else was great!",1

The lo mein is amazing! The crab rangoon is now the only one I will eat now because every other place switched to that sweet kind and there is so much crab in it!

I don't understand a lot of the complaints! I have never been to a cleaner, better tasting, or nicer place. I mean they don't know me by name they know my dad and I still love it.

It is a little more expensive but the portions are HUGE! Parking is a bit rough but well worth it! I think some people complain to complain. 

I never heard anyone I recommend this place to complain!",1

I ordered the mushroom burger and my friend order the classic cheeseburger. I honestly enjoyed hers a lot more. I thought mine was way to salty. The mushrooms were overpowered by the potent teriyaki sauce they smother the patty in. I didn't really enjoy it.

Their fries were good though!  Crispy and crunchy and you can tell its freshly made. If I come here again, I think I'll just stick to their traditional burger with cheese, lettuce and tomato.",0

trn_6347,"I'll keep this short.  Today for the 2nd time in a couple years the Doctor I was seeing just up and left.  Now, that's everyone's right and I appreciate that, however, what is ABSOLUTELY NOT right is the total lack of information this group overlooks.  Like a number of people, I am on medications and it is totally unprofessional to not inform patients that the primary care provider has left.  You find out when your meds keep getting disapproved at your pharmacy when you need them.  Of course now, you have to disrupt your personal life to immediately find a new doctor, set an appointment (which may be delayed a few days due to lack of apt times) perhaps take more tests so that the new Dr. is comfortable with approving your meds, etc.  The point is, a simple call to existing patients is not much to ask when a Dr. leaves/thrown out of a practice which allows an controlled transition instead of panic transition to a new Dr.

Bottom line - IMHO, do not choose these people as your primary care providers",-1

In a big city, where average restaurants are a dime-a-dozen & service is generally sub-par.. This place is refreshing!

I do have issues with poor communication and  not getting my money back timely. They say there is nothing they can do because Ken needs to approve them in order.  This is the fourth week since I canceled the order ( that I placed in Feb , 10 week lead time ) and they still can't tell me when I will get my money back. Ken continues to hide behind his employees. Ken won't return or take calls and for sure not taking responsibility for this or he would have called every customer personally. Really unfair to his employees.  Just filed complaint with the BBB.

trn_6369,"As being from Los Angeles, I grew up with Sam Woo.  I really like their simple but delicious soup noodles, noodle plates, rice dishes, BBQ pork, and all sorts of cooked Chinese dishes.  Never was disappointed...

...until I visited this Sam Woo.

Somehow this Sam Woo is different.  While it offers the same type of dishes found at other Sam Woos, the food here is not especially well prepared, on the very greasy side, and quite surprisingly expensive for what you're getting.

Upon my latest (and most likely last) visit I had the wonton soup noodle bowl and chicken lo mein.  There was nothing wrong with the soup noodle bowl but it could use some more Chinese broccoli.  

The chicken lo mein was (in my mind) an utter disaster.  Instead of the fat roundy smooth lo mein noodles, it was prepared using thin wiry egg noodle which was all degrees of ""wrong"".  I ate this stuff all my life...you can't fool me!  The chicken pieces were bland and the noodles where swimming in grease.  The only thing on that plate that was decent was the Chinese broccoli.  Besides that I would never ordered this plate if I've known.

Prices here are typically $3 more than any other Sam Woos I've been to.  Service was of course crappy with minimal acknowledgment.  I even had to ask for change back as they assume the extra $8 were for them.  Giving them such a big tip for sub-par service...I think not!",-1

trn_6372,"A very nice large place, lots of natural light through the picture windows. The staff is pleasant and helpful. Young supervisors are keeping an eye on things. I always have the chicken burger with fries. And beer!! It's not everywhere you can get beer with your burger. The chicken is very good, a large slab, nicely grilled. They will load your bun with decent relishes. But guys, why don't you pay more attention to your fries?? You have lot going for you, why not first class fries? After all, for me and lot of other folks, fries are the forbidden fruit. To be had once in a while as a treat. Only when one is lucky the fries taste fresh. Other than 'fries anxiety', this is the best burger place at Yonge & Eglinton, The Hole-e-Burger nearby cannot compete. Lately the South St. installed large TV screens, which are broadcasting sports events. This is not a boon for myself, but to be fair, I am not their prime customer.",0

I started with their miso soup and shared the garlic bread as well. I ordered sushi, california and ebi-tan rolls. Both simple and perfect for my tastebuds. Our table shared a bottle of a very dry white wine, can't recall the name but it hit the spot perfectly.

Judging by what was available today, the prices were very reasonable - ranges from $1 to $5 (I guess they may add more stuff later though). I picked up taro pastry (I forget the exact name) and chocolate baguettes, and they were so amazinggg. They're generous with the taro filling and I THINK it also has cream cheese in it.

trn_6378,"While I acknowledge I got there at 5:05 am - 5 minutes after they were set to close, the complete lack of compassion of the people I encountered was quite surprising.  Here I am, 5 months pregnant with a sick toddler still in his PJs, in an obvious rush to make it in the doors by 5 a.m.  The lobby is completely empty and the front door unlocked when I arrive.  I hear someone in the back say ""that's not someone new, is it?""  and another voice responded ""no, probably just someone leaving.""  Next thing I know I see the people who own the voices I heard - one looks like one of the doctors or nurses and the other like the person who runs the front desk area.  All I get is ""sorry, we're closed.""  With the fact that I didn't make it in time sinking in, near tears (I blame the pregnancy hormones) I explain that I had a difficult time finding them in the strip mall where they are located and got stuck at a light.  This time I get one word - ""sorry.""  I look up to see faces of stone.  Nothing.  Neither of the ladies offered any suggestion on where else I might be able to take my sick child to be seen by a doctor, which we were obviously in need of since we'd come to their urgent care for that very reason.   I say, ""you guys don't open again until 9 pm, right?""  I get a short reply, ""5 pm.""  I then ask if they know when Phoenix Children's urgent care opens.  Absolute silence.  I know this is technically a competitor, but if you care about kids, wouldn't you want to ensure a sick child gets the care he needs irrespective of whether it comes from your company or another?  I was so frustrated when I left that I did  start to cry a bit as I buckled my son back into his car seat and made my way home to wait the 7 hours until the next pediatric urgent care opened.  On the drive home I tried to see the positive side of my encounter- maybe it was a good thing that we were too late to be seen since I wouldn't want such uncaring people to treat my son anyway.",-1

Please people, this restaurant serves east northern ( dong bei) homestyle wheat based dishes.  They may have some of the American Chinese dishes on the menu but that is  for the clueless diner that wandered  in wantingpork fried rice and egg fo young for  chinese dishes and not what they specialize in.  Please read Jennifer 8's great book on Chinese reataurants and you can undestand what the differences are.  
This restaurant does decent and tasty dumplings, green pancakes, breads, buns (man tou)'etc,.  More homestyle but still tasty.  Does it measure up to the best of SGV, MontereyPark, Rowland Hts, ? No.  But its decent and its tasty and I applaud them for opening up here in AZ.",1

trn_6392,"Went to Upstream after finding it listed on an OpenTable Valentine's Day restaurant list.  Decided to take my girlfriend there on 15 FEB (avoid the rush) as she loves seafood.  Should have probably read the Yelp reviews before, but hey... 

Anyway, we arrived at 19:35, five minutes after our reservation time.  Hostess sat us within ten minutes of arrival at a booth.  We ordered oysters and wine to start things off.  The half-dozen oysters (Chef's Selection) was good - the New York oysters were our favorites.  Wine is definitely overpriced at this plate, especially considering how little they give you!  We were very happy our visit coincided with half-price wine night, as that made the prices fall back to the ""reasonable but still high"" range.  

For dinner, we tried the pecan crusted trout and the lobster special.  The wait was long, but the pecan crusted trout was well worth it - good meat with a good crust!  The lobster was a disappointment as it was overcooked.  We called the waiter over, and he promised to bring us a new one quickly.  Within ten minutes, we had a new lobster that was cooked more reasonably.  

As compensation for the overcooked lobster, the manager comp'ed us a dessert.  We tried the passion fruit creme brulee which was quite nice.  Total bill came to $105 (dessert was comp'ed).  

I would say that this restaurant is overrated for what it is.  While I like seafood, I think I can find it more reasonably priced elsewhere in Charlotte.  Ambiance was nice, but not worth the extra cost.",0

9$ for a half plate of overcooked calamari, with a dipping sauce that was already half-empty when served... The steak poutine was just disgusting, the sauce was sweet, few grains of cheese curds here and there, and the steak was microwaved. The portion was also incredibly small for bar food.

And don't even get me started in the steak. Yeah, who orders steak in a sport bar, right? Well I was fooled by their ""special steak"" recommended by the waiter. I ordered rare, and they give me well-done, the steak was gray throughout. On top of that, they serve a cold salad on a very hot plate (the entire plate was burning hot for some unknown reason), disgusting.

I paid for my day pass and right away the staff were super friendly.  I got to the gym an hour early before the class, so i walked around gym. The gym had a weight room area, mat area and a altitude training room.  Overall, the gym looked great!  As I was waiting my class to begin, I felt someone touch my shoulder.  I turned around and guess who it was, Wanderlei Silva!!! I was shell shocker!! He thanked me for coming to his gym and ASKED ME if I wanted to take a picture.  I can't believe I totally forget to ask for a picture, luckily Wanderlei reminded me.  
After talking with the legend for a second, my class started.  I took the no-gi grappling class.  The instructor was great and took the time to work with everyone.  After working on the technique, you had the option to spar.  I chose to spar and did ok.  I could tell there were so very good grapplers at the gym.

Greens we were told were punched a month ago but the practice green was Long / Hairy and downright carpet like. 

Played the Sunrise & Canyon 9's the Lakes was not offered to us.  Sunrise was OK if not non descript with fairly plush fairways though greens again were very slow and uneven.  The Canyon 9 you could have taken a bulldozer to this piece of land and nobody would miss it.   Simply stated a browned out mess of 9 holes of golf that had no business being opened to the public.

The menu is an odd mix of nothing-fancy traditional American brunch food and Mexican fare. With that said, the French toast and eggs that I ordered were pretty darn tasty. I cleaned my plate (and I never clean my plate.) I was pleasantly surprised. Aside from the odd menu, the place is quaint, cute, incredibly clean, and the service was friendly. I probably would have given it 3.5 stars if I had the option...but I went with 4 because the food /coffee was better than I thought it would be, and the service was great. Nothing too special...but worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood and want a decent plate of brunch food (or a burrito...)",1

If I have to choose between 5 Guys and the Freddy's that just opened in the same parking area.... I will choose Freddys. If I want a really good hamburger I will go to Smash Burgers!",-1

trn_6407,"If I could give Allegiant Airlines less than one star, I would but unfortunately that is as low as I can rate them. Our bad experience started last year when our kids were going to a camp in San Francisco. We show up on July 4th and they said the flight had been cancelled. My daughter said they waited in line and when they got there she said I want to check in for my flight to Oakland and he said good luck getting on a cancelled flight. Wow. I spent a long time on hold with them to get it resolved and they would not put them on another flight. We had to buy expensive flights to get them there on another airline and the best they wold do is give us a voucher. We are trying to use the voucher now as it is about to run out and it is not in our online account. I called, got on the phone and was on hold for 59:21. When the woman finally answered, she was rude and unhelpful. I told her we had been on the phone a long time and I asked her to take my number down and call us back if we got disconnected. She said our daughter had already used the flight. I said no, and she said well you will have to check on that. I asked her where she wanted me to check? WTH? Then she said can I place you on a brief hold...15 minutes later she disconnected me. How do you get through to this company to help you?",-1

trn_6410,"Typical McDonald's, located in the food court at the MGM Grand.  

Prices are reasonable and no higher than any free standing location and they are open 24 hours.

Cashiers are reasonably friendly, considering what they have to deal with most times (crazy, out of control drunk people).  They offer an employee discount the MGM employees - it's not a lot, but it's better than nothing.

The only thing of note is that breakfast is not available 24 hours (like most McDonald's locations) - but starts at 4am.

It always seems like the food is ready quicker than anywhere else I've been.  Not sure if that is good or bad!

Basically, if you are too cheap to dine at the other late night option (Wolfgang Puck's), this is a good choice.  Especially if you are just getting back from the club.",0

They don't treat you like a ""regular"" customer, but as one of the family.

As for the pizza, the crust has the right consistency and texture.  There is a hint of garlic but it really balances everything out.  My favorite is their white cheese pizza with spinach.  Huge slices and a very balanced flavor.  Those comments are not easy to come by from me as I am a pizza ""snob"" originally from Chicago.  I even told Tony that this is the BEST NY pizza I have ever eaten...PERIOD!  

I have also had pasta and other dishes there and they have a very nice taste as well.  I am not afraid to recommend this place and even tell those I send to let Tony know I sent them.",1

trn_6422,"came to check out the bar menu. i really would like to check out the regular menu next time, but i need to make a lot more money. i've been reading one of my favorite foodblogs (www.eatinglv.com) and saw a review on the best burger in vegas. i was suprised it wasn't located in one of the many burger joints in vegas (burger bar, blt, etc.). it was in a fine dining, michelin rated restaurant. i knew that bradley ogden is a seasonal, farm to table type of restaurant, so i never guessed that they would even have a burger on the menu. burger is very straightforward. brioche bun, cheddar cheese, meat. mayo, ketchup, pickles, mustard, and fries on the side. also, the meat is basted with red wine butter as it cooks on a  wood fire grill. i thought, ""man a lot goes into this burger."" and i was sooo right when i bit into it. juicy, meaty, flavorful, and most of all delicious. worth the $16 dollars.",1
trn_6423,"I almost always get the Chicken and Waffles because they're exceptional. Chicken is always fried perfectly so it's moist inside, waffles are fluffy and absorb just the right amount of syrup. 

After my first taste of the deliciously moist chicken, I thought to myself -- what was missing? A condiment! Ketchup and ranch would mask the flavors, I needed something more subtle, and maybe a little sweet. Honey Mustard of course! I worked myself up, proud of myself for knowing just what I wanted. 

Well, they don't have honey mustard. 4 stars.",1
trn_6424,"Pretty good cheeseburger. Toppings were fresh and the burger tasted good. Fries were good, but not worth the price. They are potatoes after all not truffles. I would suggest they up the price and include the fries.

Great beer selection no doubt. If you want a decent burger and a good beer I would try this place. Not a place to seek out from a distance, but if you are in the area I would recommend it.

The waiter was a nice guy, but not a very good waiter. Never stopped by after I received my food nor could I get a check. I had to flag him down. Maybe he was new to being a waiter.

They did have a  nice sports TV setup.",0

trn_6426,Sun Valley Cafe is great for a quick bite for a good price. The food is good and consistent and the wait staff is always friendly and fast with refills and such. Plus they give you free soup! Who doesn't like that? I love their salads and my husband loves their meatball sub and cheesesteak... But only with onion rings instead of fries (they aren't anything special).,1
trn_6427,"A great addition to downtown Kent! I like that the names of the sandwiches are all Kent State alumni. A lot of people think they are ripping off Melt, but I honestly think this place is better just from a service standpoint and the fact that it's Kent specific. 

The food is really good. The portions are HUGE. I usually take half of my sandwich home and eat it later. There are a few vegetarian options, but I wish there were more. 

My one complaint is that there isn't a lot of seating. Most of their seating is in the garage patio, which in the winter gets really cold. You also have to cut through the ice cream shop next door to get to it. From the outside, it looks like it is to-go only from the lack of tables. 

Overall, if I'm really hungry and in downtown, my friends and I like to go here. I have to be in the area though. I wouldn't come out of my way to go here.",0

I timed my day accordingly so i am back home in time before my guests arrives. I had to go pick up other hot food trays from other restaurants first. Went to Ai to pick up my order last before heading home. I presented the 10% discount coupon i had, the cashier tells me it is only 10% discount if paid by cash. I emphasized that nowhere on the 10% discount card does it say 'cash only'. The cashier then tells me i can pay by credit card and not have 10% discount applied, or go to the bank and get the discount.  I didn't want to have hot foods in my car get cold so i paid by credit card and not get the discount.
The 10% discount coupon is very misleading. Can't believe they let me leave with a horrible experience like that. I won't be returning.",-1

So many different options for fried rice and beans, also so many different ways you can have your meats. On a plate like panda express, or you can have them throw it into a small quesadilla or small burrito. 

Not somewhere I eat often. But definitely something I'll crave randomly, because the flavors are really good for fast food",1

trn_6438,"I'm ganna try and make this short, sweet and to the point...but that rarely happens. I started a new job after moving from Texas, and It would a understatement of I said I was just a huge coffee fanatic. I can easily have 5-6 cups a day, and still go right to sleep-but anyways this Starbucks is located less than a mile from my job, which makes it extra convenient. 

I end up having anywhere between 1-3 cups from this location in particular because of its location. It's hidden in the corner after you pass a preschool, so it can easily be missed-nonetheless it's there! 

It has 2 entrenches, which is great if there's no line. However if there is a line use the door furthest from the subway, because that's where you can find the tail of it. 

Every Friday has a ""theme"", and all of the workers get pretty into it; I'm a huge fan of it. I find myself purposely going on Fridays I have no business being on that side of town just to check it out. 

The service is always great! The best part of this location is that from my office I can mobile order, and by the time I get there my drink is ready at the bar and waiting for my arrival. 

This location only had a handful of tables, and most days are full. Since I only go to get my caffeine fix and leave I'm ok with that, but if not be prepared to possibly sit outside to have a table. But don't worry, there's plenty of shade that covers the tables, and who can complain when there's free wifi?",1

trn_6441,"I've been wanting to try Mr. Chows for quite a while now. Since there was so much hype about this restaurant I had some pretty high expectations and they did not disappoint.  We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated almost immediately. Once we were seated we were greeted within a few minutes with our drink menus and quickly after that the food menus. Each server that came across our table was very friendly. The service was phenomenal! 

The food was excellent and the best Asian style food I've ever had. We decided to go with the recommended set price menu, while included two options from the appetizers, two options from the main dishes, a vegetable and a choice of rice. 

Pot stickers: INCREDIBLE. They are crispy and unlike anything I've ever had before. 

Mr. Chows noodles: which the noodles themselves are made in house and if you're lucky you'll see them being made, were delicious. I expected more of a chow mein style noodle but instead received the noodles plain with a sauce overtop. There is an explosion of flavor once the noodles and sauce are mixed. Definitely a favorite!

Green shrimp: which is cooked in spinach and is actually green was so tender that it practically melted in your mouth. 

Beijing chicken: chicken breast that was cut into cubes. It has a soft crunchy on the outside but the meat itself was very tender and full of flavor. It had a light sweetness to it!

Green beans: DELICIOUS. I could have just eaten the green beans and been completely content. They had the right amount of kick to them. 

Raspberry cheesecake: So soft and creamy. Cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and raspberry drizzle. 

Blood oranges: I want to say that they were marinated in bourbon ( I could be wrong)? Either way they were absolutely delicious.",1

A host had found us walking around earlier in the night and had told us that we could get in for free.  We decided to give it a try as I had talked the club up to my friends who had not ever been there.  When we got in we were told we had to pay, even with the ""free"" passes we had.  We are all locals!!!  I thought ok, well this should be worth it if it's as good as it used to be.  Needless to say we wasted way too much money getting in!  The music was TERRIBLE and the drinks were way too expensive.  After about an hour of hoping that another dj would come on we finally gave up and left.  I don't think that I am going to ever go back to this place again.  The decor is exactly the same as the last time I was there a few years ago, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but the music was just so bad that as a local girl if I have to pay to get into any club I'm going to go somewhere where I can at least dance to the music!",-1

trn_6448,"I have never been here for their tapas, although heard it is good. Actually went there today for their Mother's Day Brunch. Oh man. Gross. They don't know how to treat a mom! It was like they went to Costco and bought a bunch of salty meat, cheese, and starchy sides in bulk and threw it together on a buffet. Their website indicates they would have an omelet bar (which was scrambled eggs) and a dessert bar (which was 2 different types of danishes). 

The selection was lousy and small. I don't love meat but I tried their turkey which was fair. I tried their mixed greens, also fair. And their sauteed vegetables which was carrots, red pepper, onion and celery. Really??! They couldn't throw in a brussel sprout or broccoli or something? Two veggie selections and no fish. 
 

If you're all about the meat and potato guy, I'm sure it made dad happy but even my husband  thought the food was below mediocre. We paid 39.99 per adult which seems overpaying for something that didn't look like it required a lot of effort. 

Forget ending on a sweet note. Dessert was like some sort of pastry you could buy in a box at Costco. Store bought Entemann's danish?? Anyone? No chocolate, no nothing. I wouldn't exactly call it a ""dessert bar"". 

It's not really fair to give a one star review when I have never tried their tapas but I wouldn't recommend going there for Mother's Day Brunch and I was so turned off by this experience, not sure I'd give it another try.",-1
trn_6449,"I really, really, really, really wanted to like Buca Yorkville sooooooooo much. I was super excited to go. I had been waiting for a couple of weeks to go for my birthday. 

Pros: 
- Fantastic cocktails and bartender(s). If anything, you need to stop in for a drink. Bartender was very friendly, chatted with us, etc while we waited for our table.
- Service was phenomenal. Very attentive. Staff was friendly and informative. 
- Burrata pizza was very, very tasty. We should have ordered two of these.
- They gave me a take away pasta for two to make at home as a birthday gift. I thought that was sweet :)

Cons:
- Was not a big fan of the Salumi De Mare. I understand you don't want to go too full force with seafood but be creative with it, you want to bring out how delicate it is, etc. I admire the plating, it was very beautiful. I just wish the flavour had matched the presentation. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Also, we were given the eel (which we didn't order) instead of the halibut but fair enough, we didn't mention it as we didn't want to make a big deal.
- The crisp olives stuffed with beef sausage... meh. Again, underwhelming.
- The $26 side of sauteed porcini mushrooms... that were gritty. Every bite was gritty. Perhaps we just received a bad batch, but eek. Every bite had grit in it. Honestly, we should have just had another pizza instead of the mushrooms. 

There were very redeeming parts of the meal, but the overall experience was lacking. Maybe I just hyped it up too much in my head?  I should have listened to my friends who advised that I go to the King St location. I wanted a night out in Yorkville but I think if I go back to Buca, it will be the King St location only.",0

First the positive: The outside patio is lovely.

But the negative outweighed the positive for me:  There are no vegetarian dishes on the happy hour menu. The server did tell me there were vegetarian dishes on the main menu, but the only thing that looked vegetarian was the tomato  burrata salad I it was terrible and over-priced. El Chorro would do better to serve the traditional caprese salad. I did not eat the salad.  It was supposed to be served with crostini, but I never received that either. I did ask for some bread and the server acted like it was unusual but finally served me some old, hard sour dough bread. Definitely not going here again.

trn_6457,"First of all I have to say that I was here a few weeks back as part of a company dinner event with clients, and we were seated in a private party room with a pre-fix menu, so this review is based on that.

Now, I have to admit that the food is quite good here, and worthy of the many glowing reviews being bandied about.

We started with a ""Family Style Canoe"" which featured crunchy golden style lobster potstickers, sesame seared shrimp, grilled Szechuan pork ribs, and blackened island ahi. Everything on this appetizer boat was very good, but the ribs were absolutely amazing! I pretty much scoffed down all four ribs that were on the plate - sorry everyone who didn't get one!

""Sweet Home Waimanato Salad was next. It came with a creamy herb dressing. As far as salads go it was just ok and pretty standard.
 
There were four plates offered as entrees. As a main entree I ordered the ""Hibachi Grilled Salmon"" which came with a Japanese citrus ponzu. The salmon was prepared perfectly, and was a great choice for one trying to eat healthy while on the road.

Of course, it's not all about having no fun, as I had to try the ""Dessert Sampler Plate"". Each plate came with three mini desserts. Yeah, I ate all three. Can't remember much of what they were, maybe a cheesecake thing, and a chocolate thing, but all were eaten happily.

The staff here is on-point. Everyone I encountered were more than helpful and highly courteous. Our room was nicely appointed and they even had a special menu printed up for our company event which added a personal touch. 

Must definitely book a meal here next time in Vegas on a vacation to check out what a regular dinner is like. Great spot off the strip!",1

Jacquelyn, my girl, she along with a few others, really made my experience the best possible! I brag about this place to everyone since my experience was so wonderful. Also, DJ Murphy was THE BOMB.

trn_6460,"Several moments of peace and clarity have swept me off my feet in front of the fountains of Bellagio. I have been encouraged by friends to make decisions that have changed the trajectory of my life for the better while waiting for the show to begin. Something about the lights and the water create such an existential experience! All in all, I may seem biased, but this is hands down the best free street attraction in Las Vegas. 

Highly recommend checking it out at night to fully experience the ambience of the fountains in front of the Bellagio. Worth it to find the midway point to see the fountains in all its glory. 

Shows every 15 mins after 7pm until midnight. Shows every 30 minutes from 12pm to 7pm. The speakers also announce when the next showing will be. Stick around for two showings to see the variety that the show offers. There is some awesome music playing on the speakers and plenty of people watching opportunities to keep you entertained while waiting for the next show. If you're not into embarking on a spiritual experience, this is also a great opportunity to pretend that you were a part of Ocean's 11.",1
trn_6461,"It's 2 miles away from the strip.  Decent place, had a kitchen with great china & cookware for cooking.  Wasn't bothered by the maids as we didn't  dare have them clean our room, LOL.  Didn't bother using the pool.  Never ran out of hot water and the A/C was on 24/7.  They have an iPod docking station.  Forget what station we were listening too but sounds like the DJs just loop the same music over & over again.

Check the drawers for extra towels & blankets.  Nice patio area.

trn_6464,If you're looking for a great breakfast for $10-$20 then you NEED to visit. Always super crowded but it's for a good reason. This place is awesome. The prices are fair and you get LARGE portions. While most places have dwindled down their plate sizes this place has stuck true to filling you up. I'm a big eater and i've never left here without a to-go box.,1
trn_6465,"This is a pretty good shop, overall nice selection of items and Ejuice. Staff is alright, could be a little more interactive with customers but overall were helpful then most other places I've been too. The one thing i did like is their house Ejuice line. They have some pretty good flavors. Summer wapple has to be the best out of all them. 

In terms of large selection they don't have a lot, they do have nice authentics and clones but not a large selection to choose from. They do have updated items that people are looking for but for me  I wish they had more. Instead of going every week to see what they have I wait about two or three weeks because  I know they wont get in stuff for a little. Might be a downer for most but I can live with it.",1

For a fill? I have to find somewhere. I'm always at Chevron getting gas and I happen to see this place. I said okay I'll give it a try. I am so happy I did! Vivian did my nails. All the girls there are so funny and friendly! The fact it is only a few blocks away I have found my new spot. She took her time and made sure I was happy. Nail shape is perfect. A little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. :-) i will be back soon for additional services. I came on a Wednesday morning and got lucky to get in. They were starting to pick up as I was leaving. The shop is clean and stylish with all kinds of fun color options. I got the cat eye and I am so happy I did! Thanks again guys!",1
trn_6468,"Over the years, Yorkdale Wellness has continued to serve our family with excellent quality massage therapy. They set a high standard for any new RMTs they hire, and they're typically trained by the Sutherland-Chan School. My former RMT, Lori Strathdee has now retired and sold the business but her excellent team of RMTs are still there to assist us. Today my daughter's regular RMT, Stacey Grigsby, was unavailable. My daughter suffers from fibromyalgia and has inherited ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from me, so we both have chronic severe back pain. Without periodic massage, neither of us could function. Since my daughter had a flare up of sciatica, she couldn't wait for her regular appointment with Stacey. So we opted for a newly hired RMT, Natalie Aviles. We really lucked out with her, because she herself has experienced sciatica flare-ups and has fibromyalgia. She knew exactly what to do to give my daughter substantial relief from pain. My daughter couldn't sleep all night last night cause the sciatica kept waking her up with excruciating pain. Now after an hour's massage from Natalie, she's feeling much better. I would recommend the caring and very competent Yorkdale Wellness staff, especially their Registered Massage Therapists, to anyone. You're in good hands with these people!",1
trn_6469,"We've been putting off coming here because my wife doesn't care much for seafood. I on the otherhand, love it. One weeknight we had just exercised at the nearby LA Fitness and wanted to try someplace different for dinner. It was a weeknight and we thought it wouldn't be too busy. We were not sorry for our decision.  
The first thing I should mention was that we went on an unusually warm spring evening. Their patio was open and I have to say that you need to check this place out. We were surrounded by sand and waterfalls.  There were several firepits and couch style seating. They really make you feel as though you're on vacation.  
I should mention that the service was very good. The food was also wonderful with enough selections from both the land and the sea to keep us both happy. The only downside was the the prices are a bit high, but the quality and atmosphere are worth it for special occasions,  like when the sun goes down.",1

trn_6472,Decent Italian American food but nothing really authentic or memorable.  Pasta was kind of bland but I'm very biased since I travel to Italy on a fairly regular basis.  The bar staff didn't seem too enthusiastic but then again I think one of them was from New Jersey and people from there usually strike me as odd and/or irritating.   Oddly the power went out during dinner and the smell of smoke from the pizza ovens started to stink up the bar.  Would skip this restaurant and check out the steak restaurant at Gold Nugget instead.  I heard really good things about that place.,0

trn_6474,"I love the ice cream.... Kawartha, of course!!! 

I would normally just go to Demet$@@ (shhhh), but it is so great that we have something up here in Newmarket. 

The set up is like a diner style. Several booths, and there is a few two-person tables. Free wifi. Service is good, well relaxed. The selection of crepe, waffle, and toppings is good. I mean, it is enough to make a combination of either savoury or sweet dish to enjoy. I have only tried the sweet crepe (i.e., ice cream crepe, as opposed to waffle and chicken). 

On to the food. Crepe and ice cream were so good. I shared mine with one other person but you could eat it one by yourself. The price was $11-ish for the crepe with one flavour ice cream with two toppings and sauce. 

Someone in our party ordered apple cider drink. Don't do it. I felt that it was just apple juice from the can, heated up, in the microwave. Stick to the ice cream crepe or waffle.",1

trn_6476,"The Keg King West 
This is not your average Keg. 
Upscale and a good time had by all 

I've eaten at the Keg all over Canada, and this is the One. I do mean THE ONE. The menu is the same the service seems to be more high end Supper club than your traditional Keg. 

This King west like location has some of the most beautiful people to ever serve you food. I always sit at the bar to watch the crowd and the bartenders at work. The Bar staff at this Keg work hard and seem to make perfect drinks with style and grace. 

Crystal my server was a new Keg employee. When the Keg opens a new restaurant they generally take people from all the other Kegs to complete their staff. I watch this server make drinks and serve me to Keg perfection.  Kudos on her Kudos on the staff around her. 

Now to the meal. I ordered the 10oz filet as always. Today was medium. 
Let's start with the salad. I've been to Kegs where the salad smelt like the fridge. Not this Keg fresh Fresh is the word. 

Now the Steak. Perfection is the word. There's something different about this Keg. This Keg is a Keg by name only in my eyes. Hands Down Best Keg I've ever had a meal at. Jacobs is just around the corner and the Keg is just as good or better. Not as stuffy. This is the Best Keg Staff around. You deserve this title you earned it. Sorry Keg Mansion. This is a must eat experience to be had. 


Side note. This must be told. Crystal while bar tending broke a glass near the ice. She did the right thing and changed the ice right away. Believe it or not I've seen other places Not change the ice. 

So to the Keg you've out done yourself with this location. best Food Best Staff Best Design in this writers opinion. My other favorite Keg in Ontario is Waterdown Ontario.",1
trn_6477,Great personalized service and unbeatable prices. Will definitely be buying my parts from him!,1
trn_6478,"Literally the worst place I've ever eaten at for seafood. The batter was worse than store bought fish sticks. Along with the shrimp and the onion rings which were hard battered with the same thick batter as the nasty fish. I paid $9.24 for a small piece of fish and 4 largely over battered shrimp with some fries and onion ring mix, and I have never regret spending money at a mom and pop shop before until now. Sadly, the fries were the best part. Definitely will not return.",-1
trn_6479,The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake.,-1
trn_6480,"Very dependable delivery, and good quality dim sum (on majority, but not all items). Dim sum delivery?? Awesome! I'm a huge fan of good quality food that provides consistent good service. My review is based on delivery only, because I've never actually dined in yet. A great option for those that have had a long night partying and cannot even think of going out for food, or if you're just plain lazy. :)
Har gow, shui mai, fried crab claw, soy sauce chow mein, and Hong Kong pan fried noodles are my favorite choices. The noodle soups are great too, I ordered wonton egg noodle soup with added bbq pork and it hit the spot nicely.
The beef/shrimp rice roll is okay but not great. The other dim sum items are hit or miss so I just don't order them anymore. The rice porridge is very bland, so that is also another item I opt not to order.
With that being said, to each their own. This place has many great items to order. A must try for summerlin patrons! Delivery service is fast, friendly, and very efficient.",1
trn_6481,"Thank your preferred deity, these sliders are heavenly.  

Fast-ish food on the Danforth has been a slog the last couple years, with gyros and pizza the only reliable options.

I had a jerk chicken and meatball slider.  Totally different flavour combinations, and each sang totally different and totally sweet notes.  The sauces, toppings, and meat were awesome.  As were the buns... perfectly toasted.  Fries were excellent (I had the regular ones, not sweet potato). Only other place in the neighbourhood for a better burger than McDs/Licks is Burger Stomper, and I've had mixed bag of experiences there.

I really hope this place makes it. The location is just east of Pape about a block away from the really hopping stretch of Danforth. Worried the crowds might overlook it.",1

trn_6495,"This place is a madhouse after 7 pm to closing on the weekend. I didn't realize how good I had it at the ABC store on Harris Blvd in University. Most trips there was hardly a line, and if it was it went quickly. 

On my first Friday night trip, the line went all the way to the back wall. Initially, I asked myself if i REALLY needed a bottle of liquor to get me through the evening. I thought about the minuscule amount of vodka in the pantry, and decided to stay. Perhaps if there were 3 registers open instead of two the line wouldn't have been that long.

The characters were out in full force this night. Some people a little loud, and one person even knocked over a bottle of liquor by accident. By the time I reached the front of the line almost a half hour later, the line went around the store and almost to the door.

I do appreciate the selection, I've been to many of the ABC stores around town, and from the ones I've seen, only the Matthews (or maybe it's the Indian Trail) store on Independence and the store down the block from UNCC have a wider selection.

Just get here early!",0
trn_6496,"Had a great time on our last night in Vegas.  After spending the day at Hoover Dam and really needing some refreshments when we returned to the hotel we decided to just stay in and eat in house.  First of course we had to spend time at the bar and quaff a few (ok, way more) cold ones, enjoy the ambiance and a nice guy bar tender named Andy.    Andy even provided some bread with olive oil dip later on (I guess there's a name for it, but all I know is it hit the spot after much beer) when we decided to make a reservation and just eat there.  After an hour or so wait (and more beer) we sashayed (ok, stumbled) into the main room to enjoy some delicious Italian food.  Excellent shrimp cocktail followed by (by me) some spaghetti with meatballs and sausage, ( I wanted old school), were served by Arturo our waiter, in a friendly and efficient manner.  We even had some GREAT cheesecake and other deserts, which on top of the beer and food made me so happy later on that the wife remembered to pack the bottle of Tums. Andy the bartender even stopped by to say hello and say he enjoyed talking to us while we were getting bombed at the bar.  A great experience all the way around.  Staying at the Golden Nugget is always fun for us, but being able to eat and drink (to excess even) and have such a great time and excellent meal at the same time and place made it even better.  Looking forward to next time.  Thanks Grotto.",1
trn_6497,"Called 16 days before my scheduled event to order chairs and tables. Scheduling was easy and efficient. I run a lot of errands throughout the day so texting and/or emailing works best for me. Pricing was within range with others I have seen so that was a plus. I did see on their website that they only run a 6 hour rental time frame which put my party for a little damper but we initially worked around it. We initially shorthand our party from 5 hours to 4 hours so we would have enough time to set up and break down. It wasn't until my husband went to pick up the tables and chairs that he expressed the 6 hour window was RIGHT at their 9pm close time. The husband was really nice and told my husband not to worry and just bring them back first thing in the morning. That was really nice of him and allowed our party stragglers to hang a little at the end.

The only issue we had were that the tables were a little on the dirty side. It didn't pose a problem because we put our Christmas table cloths on top but do feel we should be warned just in case people plan on using clothless tables.",1

trn_6501,"This is one of my absolute favorite hotels in the world! Very spacious! Every room is a suite. Comfortable bed and absolutely amazing service. 


I love the location of the hotel on the strip and the overall hotel vibe and the attached shopping center is an added bonus. From the moment you drive into valley parking, the impressiveness of the hotel is astonishing! 

Fast and easy check in, help with your luggage and your on your way to a relaxing vacation! We live about four hours from Vegas, not too far, so we try to get out to Vegas for amino vacation at least once a year. We have stayed at the Venetian a few times (Vegas and Macau) and we have absolutely loved our stay! 

A thumbs up to the Venetian for their wide selection of places to eat, shopping and location. Many fun things to do and see on the strip and within walking distance. They also have a gondola  for those hopeless romantics

trn_6502,"Want lobster, but don't want to go through the mess of buying one, steaming it, cleaning it, and taking out all the lobster meat piece by piece, then rock lobster is for you!

They put fresh lobster on poutine, tacos, rolls, mac n cheese, etc. All perfectly prepared. Want just a lobster? They do that as well.

Also, when we went, they had a lobsterlicious menu where you can get an app, main, and desert for 25 bucks!

Also, they usually have daily deals as well. taco tuesday, whole lobster sunday, etc. 

Don't forget to addon a lobster caesar as well. The only drink you will have with a lobster tail sticking out of it. 

Lobster not your thing? Don't worry they have alternative options like crab! They also have seafood plates, soups, etc. But if you are coming to a lobster place, get the lobster!

trn_6505,"The food:
If you're going here, you might as well splurge like you already are. Order the Ishi Yaki - it's at least $150 worth of Wagyu beef that you'll season and toss on your own hot-stone, leaving it to cook to your liking. You may also offend your neighbors: they'll envy your plate, but they may also not like how the smoke is incidentally wafted in their direction by the vents. 

The wild Mushroom Toban-Yaki is on the salty side. The Tiger Shrimp Tempura is more than enough for 2 people despite being labeled as a small plate - loved it. I didn't like the Lobster Taquitos because of the lemongrass and ginger. The Watermelon Mojo beverage had too much mint for my liking. I'll be back to try out other dishes!

The service:
I'm also not typically a fan of Asian cuisine, but I definitely enjoyed most of everything else that was ordered. I appreciate the waiter serving my table for making recommendations (and yes, up-selling). They definitely came by to check on us very often.

Lucky side note: 
I think I've decided on going to SushiSamba during their slow times: right after the holidays and before New Years Eve. It sounds like this place is less hectic during this time frame. Even so, I managed to have a piece of plastic flung my direction during dinner. I thought I had been drinking too much, or a part of the restaurant's decor had started to deteriorate but nope - it was a patron's credit card that somehow flew out of one's hand and landed behind my seat cushion and the wall lighting/backrest. They nearly had the whole place turned upside down trying to find the thing. My date and I should have taken this luck to go gambling afterwards.",1
trn_6506,"This place reminds me of visiting in Mexico. Upon entering its kind of worn down and relaxed.. the staff smiles at you through the smoky air. The smoke lingering is from the fajitas juices hitting mesquite charcoal as they bring them to your table. Heavenly!

Now Ive been here many times of the years as it's very close to my work. When there are vendors in town we usually take them here as a nice alternative to all the chains that they seem to prefer. So over time Ive tried many dishes here but my favorite is what's called a Pechuga.. breast of chicken with melted cheese served between two flour tortillas. For me this is so good because of the trio of salsa's they bring to you after your sat. They make a green, a red and a pico de gallo so the Pechuga is the perfect platform for all their tasty salsa's. The #15 comes with the Pechuga as well as 2 beef tacos.. the taco's aren't served in those greasy hard shells but in fresh corn tortillas.. Mexico City style! Another great crevice to pour loads of salsa into! Mmm!

Salsa and crevice.. what a great combo!",1
trn_6507,"An absolute delight. Enjoyed the Drexler and Bibby, both refreshing, tasty and boozy. The Drexler almost tastes like a lighter, gin based manhattan? Really liked it.

The space is light, minimalist and charming. The food was excellent - catfish nuggets, chiccarones (with hot sauce) were a great start and the pork shank and duck confit were delicious. Can't wait to come back.

trn_6509,"I really had a bad service today with Atlas, after 1.5 years of being loyal to the company. The cab driver charged me 10 dollars more because he said I was moving when I wasn't. I was carrying my bags to my boyfriend's house because we are travelling tomorrow. Of course I was going to call Atlas to go to the airport but now I just changed to Diamond. The driver was condesending when I asked him to take a different route, saying he knew Montreal better than me. I was so angry that I didn't even let  the driver touch my things. I practically gave him a $10 tip for nothing.

trn_6511,"Horrible! Spent 45 minutes waiting for a table then spent another 1 waiting for our food. Had a table of 5 with 2 bowls of Pho and regular entrees for the rest. In order for us to get our food we had to ask the waiters and waitresses why it's taking so long at least 3 times, and each time we asked they came back with ""let me check on it."" Anyways, it was towards closing of the restaurant that we had received our dishes after everyone had left. Even then when new people kept coming in, they had received their food first instead of us. So before we left we attempted to chat with a manager about the lack of service and was given a bus boy to come to us instead. We explained the issue and they did nothing to resolve it on their own. The actual manager and owner saw us multiple times and did nothing to assist. Worst Vietnamese restaurant ever. Da Vang is better than this place. 

Now for the food, the bowls of Pho were small and the broth was plain chicken broth. The entrees were not only cold they were in small portions as well. For the amount of food you get here the price is definitely not worth it.

trn_6512,"We were there for a friend's birthday. Party of 12. Located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino, this place is nicely decorated, with wide spaces for each room and some wide openings on the outside, which is appreciated.
He host was very nice and made us wait for a couple of minutes in the lounge area while they were prepping our table.
We got some nice bread and butter as soon as we sat down. Then it started to become a bit more complicated... we were there at 8 pm, since they warned us they were closing at 10 pm. It literally took our server over 30 minutes to take our orders... The first appetizers came out at 9 pm.
Food is nice. Not amazing, and pretty small portions for the price. I had the zucchini flowers as an appetizer, which were good but only had 3 mini-flowers for $13... and then the baked gnocchi arrabiata for $22. Slightly over cooked and not spicy at all, despite the server's warnings.
We had to wait for another 30 minutes to order some desserts, since our server completely disappeared then.
The thing is, for a restaurant with this kind of pricing, I am expecting a higher level of service and quality. Otherwise I'd rather cook and eat at home.",0
trn_6513,"I happened upon this place on yelp, and headed here for dinner. The dishes are all served tapas style (which I love) but they really weren't that delicious (which I do not love). 
I was really excited to try the southern caprese (fried green tomatoes and house made mozarella) but the cheese was too firm, too cold and really underwhelming. The tomatoes were great, sauced with a sweet balsamic. That same balsamic, however, fully OVER-sauced the prosciutto crostinis beyond palatability. We had a sausage plate, fine but regular, a nice bean dish with a tomatoey herby sauce, and mussels, that seemed to be cooked in the very same sauce. Good sauce, just redundant. 
A cucumber cocktail was too sweet to drink and the wine was fine, but regular. 
I didn't hate it by any means, but it wasn't properly satisfying and I surely wouldn't go back.",-1

trn_6515,"Spoke to Brandon (I'm assuming an owner or manager) on a Sat night about my well pump going bad.  Explained that I performed the ohm test on the lines and they indicated the pump itself would need to be replaced. Made an appointment for Sun morning for them to come out and replace the pump.  Brandon said they had the pump and could do the job on Sunday. He price quoted me approx 2000 for the pump, 2500 for the pump and new control box together, and $1 per foot going down the well as well as $1 foot going up the well.  These are all the prices he quoted me.  Sun morning the tech arrived on time.  I explained to him what I discussed with Brandon.  He performed the same ohm test and confirmed I either had a bad pump or a bad red wire, but either way the pump would need to be pulled.  He told me they do not have any pumps available.  He added that the only pump they had was being used at another job that same day.  He then told me I had to pay $92 to have him come out, but it would be credited if I had them replace the pump on Monday. I called Brandon back up and explained that I wasn't going to pay $92 now when Brandon set an appointment with me to have the pump pulled and replaced on Sunday.  Brandon replied, ""You have to pay the $92"". And when I said I was not going to, he hung up on me.  Pretty awful business operations.  The tech did less than 5 min worth of work, and the work he did was information I had already given Brandon before setting up an appointment TO HAVE MY PUMP REPLACED, NOT TO HAVE A TECH COME OUT AND TEST TO SEE IF I NEEDED A PUMP TO BE REPLACED.",-1

From the ownership, the players, stadium, to the fan base we have it all. The ONLY downfall of being a Steeler fan is that trying to get tickets is about as difficult as trying to catch a cheetah in the open prairie. 

For those that want to experience what this is like bad can't land tickets to the game I would recommend going 2-3 hours before the game and join in the tailgating festivities. Once the game starts take your friends over to one of the many northside bars to enjoy the game. McFaddens and Bettis's are tops on that list.",1
trn_6522,"I was in the area last week for training. Found this sandwich shop on yelp and it had great reviews. 6 of us decided to check it out. When we got there was 1 lady in line and a few people at different tables in the restaurant. The girl at the counter was not friendly never greeted anyone just asked what they wanted, ok whatever. There was several sandwiches I wanted to try on the menu. My friend I decided to each order a different sandwich and split half's. I ordered the meat loaf and my friend ordered the long trail. After I ordered another customer came up and asked where his sandwich was since everyone at his table got their sandwiches but him. They were a little rude to him said they were working on it and they try to get all the sandwiches out at once but sometimes they're not able to. He walked back to his table a little flustered. So after everyone ordered we sat at tables inside and more customers came in ordered. It took a very long time to get our sandwiches, I noticed all the tables around the restaurant were pretty much full but no one had food. I counted a total of 14 people waiting for food. 1 customer came in and noticed the same and said are you backed up? The girl at the counter said yes. He left and didn't bother ordering. While waiting I heard the front desk girl pick up the phone and say well what did you order, the lady in the back had to tell her what to say and how to apologize for messing up the order and they blamed their new delivery guy for the mix up. In our group of 6 I ordered first. My sandwich came out 3rd. When the 1st and 2nd came out before mine, I thought they may have forgotten my order, I asked the girl who took my order about my sandwich. She said did you order a toasted sub? I said yes. She said that's why, no apology. Shortly thereafter the same girl came out and said meat loaf. I assumed it was mine since that's what I ordered. Another thing I don't understand when you order they ask for your name. Of the 6 sandwiches we ordered not once did they say the person's name, they just yell out the name of the sandwich. It took 45 minutes for my group of 6 to get their sandwiches. When you only have a hour for a lunch break its cutting it pretty close. As far as the 2 sandwiches I tried they were good. The older woman in the back did ask us how our food was when we were leaving, I think she might be the owner. But would I return I really don't know. The front desk girl being rude to everyone and the length of time to get a sandwich. I definitely would not try to go there for lunch on a week day if I was in hurry. I would have given them 3 or 4 stars but the rudeness and length of time to get sandwiches I had to take 2 stars off.",-1
trn_6523,"We had an enjoyable meal at Hank's.

The food was excellent and everything was prepared wonderfully.  From the Steakhouse Salad, Crab Cakes, T-Bone for 2 and sides...all delicious.  The drinks were equally awesome.

My rant, however, would be the service.  We came here a month ago and sat in the main dining room.  Again, food was awesome but service so-so.  They forgot my birthday dessert but we were full anyways so it wasn't a big deal, just disappointing.

This time, we sat in the bar area to hear the live music.  Atmosphere not as romantic as it was crowded and noisy...but it was to be expected.  No biggie.

Our waitress was nice and helpful when around, but most of the time...WHERE DID SHE GO?

She was too busy helping the party near us with cocktails.  We were the least of her worries, or at least it felt that way.  Everything was sloooow.  Spacing between appetizers, main course and dessert was T O O FAR A P A R T!  

Other than that, we really did like the food and music.

Hopefully the third times a charm, should we frequent Hank's again!  :-)",1
trn_6524,"We went in today to look at bluetooth players.  We wanted one with a USB port to play music with a stick which, apparently, is being discontinued on most models.  We were told they didn't have any that take a stick, however, we found a number of models on the shelves that took a stick.  The sales people seemed annoyed that we wanted what WE wanted and not what they thought we should buy!  We did purchase  the type of player that we went in for and are very happy with it but will never go into Fry's again.",-1
trn_6525,"I believe one must to differentiate whether they review the show or the theatre itself, so it it goes: 

The show: KInky Boots. My opinion - exceptional. If it is worth anything, I went to see it two more times after seeing it with friends first time and will probably go to see it again before it wraps up in March 2016. Fantastic vocal, acting, dance, choreography and costumes, impressive connection with the audience and great chemistry between all actors. It is an exceptional treat, I highly recommended to see it. 

The theatre: here I am less then impressed. The good:

1. The theatre is small so you will be very close to the stage regardless whether you are in the orchestra or on the upper balcony. 

2. Ushers and box office attendants are very friendly and helpful. 

The bad: 

1. The theatre is old, so seats are smaller and close to each other. A friend of mine who is 6'2"" has nowhere to put his knees. As he said, it was worse than in turbo jet planes...I am a bigger gal (but not too big) and on the short side, while I was fitting the chair fine, it was tight for me as it was for a person sitting next to me, so the closeness was a bit too much. As for the knees, I was almost hitting the row in front of me. If you are tall, get the aisle seats, so you can sit on the angle. 

2. Have dinner before coming to see a show, if you are counting on the intermission snacks, you will be disappointed. Popcorn and cookies are not exactly what you might be looking for. 
3. Washrooms are downstairs and are not clearly marked. First time when I was at the show, there was a huge line up to one of the ladies washroom while at the same time, the second one was almost empty because people couldn't see that there is another one. I noticed it only by fluk. 

4. Sport event like sale of water. OK, while folks walking between the rows with bottles of water for sale, nobody tells you that it will be available during intermission, so if you are with a company, you might want to have some water but by the time you notice the runners, it is too late. At a minimum ushers should advise you of the services available during intermission while directing you to your seats.",1

I've had their regular croissant and their almond croissant both were flakey buttery fresh goodness :) Both were everything you could want and more in a croissant and the almond croissant wasn't overly sweet or overloaded with too much almond , it had a great balance. I also discovered the kouign Amman pastry which tasted almost like a cross between cake,croissant and Danish very hard to describe but what I can say is it was absolutely delicious and light with a hint of vanilla.

I thought it was just me (due to my limited diet) but the rest of my party felt the same way. The menu itself is only one page. I ended up ordering the Brick Oven Chicken. It was moist and good as was the Mac n Cheese. Some friends ordered the Shrimp and Linguini and Salmon and said they were good. We loved the honey salted butter that was served with the bread. We had two servers (one for the bread and beverages) and our main server. Our main server was not that great but our other server was amazing. We ended up ordering a Brookie for desert. The cookie and brownie were just ok but the salted caramel chunk ice cream was amazing. We might come back again but only for special occasions as it's a little too pricey for us.",0

Its a little expensive, but the burrito is packed with meat.  So its like 2 burritos in one, for the price, its not too bad.  I usually order the shredded chicken, and its packed with shredded chicken, they don't skimp on you.  It taste good along with the other toppings in the burrito.  Putting the burrito in a panini press melts the cheese and makes the burrito taste much better.

They offer the burrito with rice or noodles.  I tried the noodles, it was good, but i preferred the classic burrito more.

Give this place a try.  I guess I have been eating taco bell for too many years to know what a real burrito is suppose to taste like.

I went home and researched what they were going to do. Finding online that it might not be medically necessary I called back to cancel my appointment. Dr. Warren got on the phone and assured me it absolutely had to be done. I went forward with the work. After it was all done, I found out they had not done their due diligence in talking to my insurance--it was not covered. I was able to scrape the money together to pay them. I was upset and paid in all $1 bills. When I went in to pay I was informed I was the third person to pay that way that day (shouldn't that tell you something?).

This place was a great surprise. Decided to try as I'm a huge fan of chicken and waffles.  The staff were nice and the atmosphere was cool and casual. We ordered two orders of fried chicken (spicy, one with waffles and spiralled carrots in a vinegrette, the other regular, with salad and biscuits), an order of Joe fries, and Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was good,  portion was average and came with garlic bread.  The starts were the Joe fries and fried chicken.  The Joe fries are probably the best loaded fries I've had.  It was hearty with meat and the portion was huge ($14). For $18,  for get half a fried chicken and sides!  Anywhere else for that prices you get two small pieces of chicken.  The chicken itself was fried well and the meat and juicy,  even the breast.  The waffle could have been more crisp but that's me being picky.  The biscuits were good and not overly buttery. Overall I'd definitely come back!",1

I went in today to try one of their juices or smoothies and the original employee that I asked did not know what was and wasn't organic. I was finally informed that none of the fruits or veggies in the smoothies or juice are organic.

This time, I was determined to wait it out at Monty's for as long as it took - which ended up being only ten minutes at around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday.  The wait was well worth every second.  My breakfast companion and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out back.  Each bite of each dish was a delight.  I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich for him because, uh huh!

We chose bruschetta for a starter to share and the toast was crispy with just a hint of garlic, and the bruschetta topping came in a separate bowl allowing you to put as much or as little as you like. It tasted fresh and was quite good.

The mains were, for me, a duck confit salad, bursting with flavour from the glaze and juicy duck meat. The poppy dressing could have been from a jar but the salad was very good nonetheless. My wife had an apple crepe which she said was passable.

Our first round of fountain Cokes tasted off and I asked for a beer instead. They kindly removed the soft drinks from the bill.

We started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!

For my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside.

We are a blended cat family, like the Brady Bunch but much cuter and snuggly. We now take all four cats to Allegheny North.

Even our ""problem child"" is handled quite skillfully and professionally, even though she tends to act like she auditioning for The Bad Girls Club when at the kitty doctor.

A while back we had an issue with one of our cats who got super sick rather quickly, approximately an hour before ANVH was due to close for the night. We called and explained what was going on and instead of insisting we go to one of the 24 hour high priced emergency services, they had us come in to be seen right away. If only my PCP was like this! The staff stayed well past closing that evening to take care of our sick little girl and it won't soon be forgotten.

Trader Joe's is like your neighborhood store, except it's not Wal-Mart (YAY.) and it's l much smaller than Whole Foods, which I appreciate. I like to enjoy my shopping trips and not feel consumed by the store I am in. Often while I am at Whole Foods I feel a little uneasy because I have a hard time meandering through their multiple aisles not finding what I am looking for. TJ's is easy to navigate and set up much more like say, Albertson's or Vons. 

Their products are wide-ranging and they offer things you will not find anywhere else. For obvious example: Cookie Butter. 

I also love when they are offering samples and pop up out of nowhere to allow you to try a new delicious cookie they happen to have that day. What's better than surprise cookie? Um, not much.

Their flowers are also pretty much the best you're going to find at any super markets/grocery stores AND the prices are rock bottom. I purchased a sunflower bouquet for $3.99 as opposed to Fresh & Easy who always sell theirs at at least $5.99 but usually more like $7.99+. On my last trip I scored an entire basil leaf plant for $2.99! Yes, that's super cheap, plus the basil plant was in perfect condition.

This place might have been a hip place back in the day, often visited by famous celebrities, and known for it's 'social' ambiance, but it must be the over-hype that made this place so highly rated.

We ordered snow crab dynamite as recommended by the waiter, and it was disgusting. It was simply fake crab meat covered with heavy cream and cheese that seemed semi baked. I really didn't know what I was eating. We ordered Jalapeno Hamachis, which were just terribly salted and covered with horrible sauce that tasted like East Asian medicine. I've had ceviches, I've had Japanese Hamachi (Yellowtail) and I clearly know the difference between the good and the bad. But, this was hard to categorize. I just don't know how they managed to make it so bad that it just broke out of my chart. After these dishes, I decided to stop ordering, and asked for the bill. It came out to $95 after taxes. My girlfriend and I are small eaters and I don't think we felt a thing in our stomach. 

Food- FAIL
Service- Good
Ambiance- Good. Modern, hip.
Price- Overpriced. 

I think you should try this place for the hell of it. It's just so shocking, I almost want to suggest that you try this place. Drink a lot at the bar and sit, maybe you'll get through better. And that's if you don't care about the bill",-1
trn_6565,"Went here for takeout lunch today for the first time. The food was superb. The tomato soup was absolutely delicious, I would put it on par with Nordstrom cafe. My sandwich was neatly packaged with hot and cold ingredients packed separately. When I arrived after placing my order online, I wet to the to-go aisle and was promptly served.  Out in less than 3 minutes. I look forward to dining in and trying new dishes.",1
trn_6566,"My husband and I went last night around 8ish.. had to wait about 40 min for a table which we expected since it was a Saturday night. Tacos were delicious... even the tortillas themselves! We got bistek (steak), chicken tinga, shrimp, and braised lamb...all were very good! Unfortunately they ran out of the ribeye tacos..so that just means we have to go back :) we ended the meal with the caramel flan..which had the perfect amount of sweetness. Loved the interior of the restaurant and service was great! Will definitely be returning!",1
trn_6567,"I honestly believe that the best thing about this place is its decor.  As Misti had said, it has a country, old/rustic but refreshing feel to the interior, and the place is great for first dates.  Service was great- the chef is preparing food in front of the kitchen, so you can actually see him doing work.  It's a very nice touch, bringing diners close and engaging them in their beliefs and methodology of how they work the restaurant.

However.. (which is why they don't garner the extra stars), I don't believe the food is quite there yet.

I make it a habit of trying steak tartar at every place I go that offers it, and maybe I'm just used to steak tartar that's made in the traditional French way, but there was something off with the tartar.

My friends had scallops, which I think was the greatest thing they had going for them- they are huge, and very robust in flavor.. something that's difficult to accomplish with scallops.  I had the swordfish, and that was lame.  It takes a great deal of know-how to bring the flavor out of a fish, and it wasn't there with the swordfish.

The curry was also mediocre.

All in all, if you're looking to find traditional taste in your favorite, classic dishes, do NOT expect anything out of their food.  They have a much, much different take on their dishes and recipes than other restaurants (which really, is what they're going for).

I guess it just wasn't there for me.",0
trn_6568,"I've been here a few times and each time the food and service has been outstanding. It's a seat yourself type of joint so be sure to get there before the breakfast or lunch rush; luckily each time I've gone, I've gotten a table. The food is the best deli food I've had in Vegas, period! The sandwiches are gigantic and the breakfast fare is bountiful. Each time I've been I've had a different type of sandwich. There are two sizes of sandwiches, the biggest size is huge, but manageable if you've got a descent appetite. All the spicy mustard they offer on the table goes great with any sandwich. My wife is a breakfast fanatic and each time we've gone she hasn't been disappointed. After our meals we take a stroll next to their dessert cases and after about 10 minutes or so we finally make our decisions. They have a huge selection of desserts that are made on site as well as their bagel selection. If you're looking for a legit deli, with huge sandwiches and tasty desserts, this is your place, you won't be disappointed.",1

trn_6570,"I went last week and was very disappointed. The reviews were very good so I was expecting better. The service is very very slow. I had the pasta with seafood and the pasta was way undercooked. I like it al dente but this was very undercooked. All the seafood was overcooked, the shrimp was very tough and the calamari was so tough I had to put it aside.",-1
trn_6571,We stopped in last nite to get a few drinks. Its not a country bar at all. No country music or atmosphere. I ordered 2 mixed drinks and they were $23 for a round. Where do you get off charging those prices. We will never be back.,-1
trn_6572,"Mixed review. This was our first visit. We enjoyed the friendly prompt service from our waitress. The coctails were well mixed. We picked a lounge to watch the Flames game and there are plenty of TV's to do that but no sound. The food was disappointing - we ordered the Nachos with chilli meat (upsell) and it looked good but disappointing - ""chili meat"" was 80% canned chilli with only traces of meat and some of the cheese appeared to be processed like cheese slices (taste and consistancy) this combo meant many chips in lower layer being soggy. Worst nachos i can ever remember having in a resteraunt. We planned to have nachos before the game and order something later during the game but nachos were so disappointing we skipped and had something to eat at home. If it was to just have a couple of coctails I might go back but not to eat. I would give it a chance if I saw reviews that the kitchen had significantly improved. Made the mistake of going without checking Yelp. Start putting out some good food and they would do much better.",-1

trn_6575,"If you read the rest of the reviews and look at the plate size you will notice that they all basically have the large round plates.  Well last night we ate here and ordered the large or regular size entrees and got the once used appetizer size plates.  I felt really cheated because we've been coming here since it opened.  Over the years we've notice the massive change in people working here, the ones we knew are gone and everybody is new.  Food tasted mediocre and hasn't changed in years, but it was worse before so I guess it has improved.  Gotta work on trying not to scam the paying public cause it will catch up.  Use the right dishes for the service and no one will complain. Will I go back, maybe in the far future cause it's really not worth the money.  Being from Hawaii I know oriental foods and I love good Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, any Asian cooking and Vegas has nothing like back home.",-1
trn_6576,"8.75 for your own choices of noodles, soup, including 2 side dishes. The food wasn't bad at all plus the service was friendly. I came here 2 times. Ofcourse you would ask if the food was good why wouldn't I rate it 5 stars. The first time I went with my boyfriend and he ended up puking afterwards. The second time we came was because his brother dragged us along and this time I was the one who vomited a few hours later. The food isn't very sanitary if this didn't only happen to me. I had no other food consumed so there wouldn't be any other reason. I would come back but I don't think food poisoning for a yummy bowl of noodles is worth it. Try it out, maybe you have a better immune system than the both of us.",0

trn_6578,"One word: DELICIOUS! BUT pricy.
I have been there a few times now and have tried different flavours of their crepe cakes like tiramisu, matcha and vanilla bean. 
All of it was delicious. It seems fresh and the texture of the crepe cake is very soft, not too sweet and kind of refreshing when the cooled cream hits your mouth.

I personally don't like how everything in North America seems to be over-sweetened so having found a place like this is nice.

Definitely worth trying.",1

trn_6581,"After the Yelp event here where I heard about how fabulous the Sunday brunch is at Upstream, I brought Mrs. K to give it a try.

Great service from the staff, starting from the hostess who brough us to a semi-private booth to the waitress explaining the buffet and cooked-to-order process and even the busboy who refilled our water glasses. I thought it was interesting that the waitstaff was all dressed like chefs - I don't know if that's intentional or not, but I liked it.

As for the food, well, it was excellent! The usual buffet staples like a cooked-to-order omelet station and a slicing station. But also a huge raw bar with large prawns, oysters, clams and mussels. On another table, salads and savories and sweet treats. Bacon and grits and smoked salmon and fresh sushi more!

But where the brunch stands out is the tapas menu. From your waiter/waitress, you order delicious plates that are a perfect little bite. Egg benedict - one poached egg on a crab cake. Smoked fish tacos - a 2 inch corn tortilla filled with smoked fish with guacamole and salsa on the side. Belgian waffles. French toast. Oh, I am stuffed!

Parking in Philips Place isn't easy but Upstream sometimes offers complimentary valet parking. It's well worth the tip to save the headache of finding a spot in the parking deck.",1

trn_6584,"Utter crap.  Some shows (see Phantom) can perhaps be excused if you're not used to seeing live shows.  Not this one.  It was just horrible.  The stage was smallish, but that wasn't bad, because it's a small set - really just one building that alters shape into a few arrangements.  Even the theater wasn't bad.  The seats themselves weren't terribly comfortable, but it's not a long show, so it was bearable.

The real problem here was the show itself.  I've seen Mamma Mia a number of times live, and all were generally about the same.  I've even seen the movie, and while it was definitely different, it was at least okay (Pierce Brosnan's voice notwithstanding).  This was just horrible.

Since the focus on this show is the songs, and how they take everyone back and all, you'd think they could do better, right?  Wrong.  Here, rather than having a band, or even a typical orchestra, it sounded like the entire show was done by one guy with a synthesizer.  The voices of the performers may not have been too bad, but that made all the songs just sound so... wrong.  It threw everything off and made it really bad.  As not-good as the movie was, this was so much worse.  Save your money.",-1
trn_6585,"The owner, and chef came out and talked about the menu. Sat with us for a few minutes after the meal to chat and see how we liked it. Very personable guy. Don't be thrown off by the deli style setting and informal dinning areas, the food is good, and the service is even better. It looked like some of the food was prepared earlier and set in the refrigerated display case. It didn't affect taste at all, it did help speed the prep time. Ultimately I would go back again. I was pleasantly surprised.",1

trn_6587,"We've been here twice and it was delicious and everyone was nice.  Last night we came in for dinner the guy and girl at the counter were less than friendly.  We ordered steak shawarma and the guy asked me 6 more times if I wanted chicken or steak and by ask me I mean he yelled at me and my son.  At one point the older gentleman that was cleaning the counter answered for me and told him that I said steak.  The food took a very long time and I'm assuming that it was due to us using a Groupon.  The girl that rang us up was less than happy to take the Groupon and actually told us we couldn't use the Groupon for or combo meals and that she would have to ring our 5 orders up separately from the fries and drinks.  So we asked her kindly to please do so and even gave her a tip.  Afterward we could here the two employees speaking in Spanish to each other deciding what to do with the older gentleman  until they eventually told him to stay in the back and out of the front.  He was really nice by the way.  Then I could hear the two of them clamoring on about customers and just being overall unkind about their patrons.  I guess they figured a group of white people obviously can't understand Spanish, guess again!",-1

I have been with her ever since, over 5 years, and she has never once let me down or missed/cancelled one appointment every 6-8 weeks like clockwork. Her work ethic & artistry is top notch.

Server seemed very rushed, barely staying at the table for 1 minute to take orders.  Today, I had my 9 year old son with us.  He ordered a steak kids meal, which the menu states is steak, vegetables, rice, and ice cream for dessert.  He got no veggies (which I didn't even mention since he won't eat them anyway) but he ate all of his meal and was excited for ice cream.  The server never mentioned or brought it, so I asked, ""he's supposed to get ice cream with his meal right?""  He says, ""oh, let me check if we have any.""  About 10 minutes later he comes back with our check and says, ""sorry we're out of ice cream."" My son says, ""do you have any other dessert?"" Server says, ""No, but the Milkshake factory is a few doors down.""  Really?!?!?  Your solution to being out of something is referring me to another establishment down the street?  Is Nakama buying him a milkshake? Otherwise, I don't know, but that just seems ridiculous to me.  He acted as if I was trying to get some freebie or something.  It says it comes with the meal.  At least offer the kid a pineapple or take a drink off the check or something.  No, I did not take it up with the manager because at this point I just wanted to get out of there.",-1

trn_6602,"This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.

There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.
Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.

And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.

For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.

While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together.",1
trn_6603,"Great that there is a supermarket in the area.  My family has been shopping here for 30 years now (we use to shop at the old location).  Prices are generally affordable which is a big plus. But with a family of big eaters our grocery bill adds up fast. 

Minuses - they promote sales but don't have the items in-store and it's not like they run out of sales items, but they don't have the inventory in the first place; & it's more than 1 item - this week salmon, pistachios, and frozen fish were on sale - I dropped by 3 times after work & there was none of any of them - major frustrating.  Another complaint would be that they will increase prices unreasonably - like I will go there to buy something at regular price at $4.49 & then the next week it's $5.49 for no apparent reason.  As well, they seem to drop items from their inventory that are necessities - like beef pepperoni or  the big green bottle of 15 litre water that they use to carry but no more.  What am I supposed to?  Go to another store to buy it?  I am not inclined to do my grocery shopping at 2 or 3 different stores to get everything I want.

I only got a 7 day trial because my gym at home was being built. I told the girl this when I signed up (so mad I forgot her name. But she was awesome)... And also said I will not be coming back after 7 days and surprisingly, she was SO CHILL about it and I was not pressured to buy/sign up for anything. I expected to have to explain myself (from my past experience using trials in commercial gyms) so this was a nice surprise.

The gym is well kept, clean, and emptier around 2pm. Also I can easily share a squat rack with other girls since every member there was so polite and knew what they were doing (and was willing to share). 

The place is a little small, so I wish they expanded it or something. But honestly... great customer service, location, and equipment :) Highly recommend if you are looking to get a quick workout in for lunch.",1
trn_6608,"OK, this place has only been open a week. However, if it wants to be known as a ""steakhouse,"" it will be competing with Mastro's, Fleming's, Grill 44 and Ruth's Chris among others. Measured alongside these restaurants, Black & Bleu's management has a lot of work to do.

The menu is a little bit of this and that. It creates the impression that this eatery has an identity crisis. Most steakhouses will bring out a basket of warm bread or rolls. At Black & Bleu, we had to ask for bread THREE times. In the end, we were brought two slices of toasted white sandwich bread more suitable for toast points than anything else -- and with NO butter. All this in a ""steakhouse"" charging $44 for a 14 oz ribeye and $42 for lamb chops.

The wine list is relatively small and mediocre, There are a number of cabernets and pinot noirs but only one merlot. On the bright side, the barmaids are easy on the eyes and the broiler station knows their stuff. Our flatiron steak and NY Strip came out exactly as we ordered. That said, the Lobster Bisque was scorched and the grilled asparagus was limp. In the restaurant world, it's inexcusable to serve your patrons burned soup.

Service was needlessly slow. The waitstaff does not know the menu. Example: they constantly referred to ""crabcakes"" when, in fact, the dish was a single crabcake. The entire waitstaff needs to be trained in the basics. Yes, Virginia, diners should be served from the left and plates removed from the right. The waitstaff has yet to master this basic tenet of service. See: www.chefalbrich.com/etiquette/ 

In sum, the menu needs to be rethought and the staff trained in proper service. Until that time, competing as a ""steakhouse"" in a market that has so many first-class steakhouses will doom Black & Bleu.",-1

trn_6612,"I am a long time fan of this wildly popular south Charlotte Chinese restaurant that has occupied the same location for the past 20 or so years. It is known for its consistently good food, superb service and affordable prices. Anne, the manager, can be regularly seen walking for table to table, cheerfully checking on guests, most of whom are regulars.

Except for some minor price increases over the years, the simple menu has had few changes. All of the standard ""American"" Chinese fare is offered. Both lunch and dinner include your choice of steamed or fried rice AND egg roll, spring roll or chicken wing. Chicken wings are incommonly good and fried golden brown with the perfect crunch. Egg rolls and spring rolls are above average. The usual soups are tasty and, as of my last visit, run less than $2. Unfortunately, brown rice is not on the menu.

Portions are large for lunch or dinner with only a slight up-charge for dinner. The dining room is normally packed but don't let a wait scare you as they do a great job moving diners through. Dining room itself is attractive but showing its age somewhat. Sanitary rating is consistently in the low to mid-90s.

You can't go wrong here. At the risk of increasing my own waiting time, I highly recommend it!",1
trn_6613,"we had the crabcakes to start but they were pretty bland and nothing special. 

i got the spaghetti and meatballs (only it was the spaghettini, which is a flat noodle). its a pretty expensive dish for what it is. i mean, the meatballs are juicy but the tomatoes tasted like they were stewed from a can. i dunno, i guess the wolfgang puck name set my expectations too high. 

our server was lame. if it wasnt for the busboy, we wouldnt have had any service. he was the one who kept refilling our drinks. the only thing our server did was take the order and give us the check.

trn_6615,Just a quick update-  saw it again!  They updated the vaudeville acts to be Cirque like.  It definitely adds.  I've noticed a ton of non-cirque shows adding cirque acts.  I also noticed some really good looking guys as well as some who have probably been with the show since the beginning.  I went in January on a non-convention night buying tix from Tix4Tonight.  I was nice to the person seating and got upgraded again to Kings Row.,1

trn_6617,"I had my wedding cocktail reception here and the food was really excellent! Everything came out quickly and the staff that passed it all out was very friendly. They trays came out at a good pace, but my guests wanted more kobe beef tacos! Those were EXCELLENT! We had the sliders, a number of maki sushi rolls, egg plant lettuce wraps that were my absolute favorite! The bartenders for our party were awesome too. Definitely want to come back and try the happy hour menu or the tasting that was advertised, sounds amazing! Thank you Social House for making my wedding memorable!",1
trn_6618,"This Cinnabon was calling my name miles away. I'm sensitive to gluten and try to stay away but as soon as I got off the tram into the Terminal D, I was done for. The smell of Cinnabons filled the air and my heart was set before I even made it up the escalator. The original is deadly enough. No thanks on the extra caramel, pecans and caramel frosting. That must be the diet version. Way to sweet for me! Funny enough, the original doesn't seem as small as I used to think. They have these awesome little Cinnabon mini's now- 6 in a pack. I don't know... I like the big outside piece of the Cinnabon. That's the best. I'll fight you for it. The inside is just too gooey. And they're coffee isn't the greatest but I didn't want to stand in another line for Starbucks so it'll do.",1
trn_6619,"Las Vegas has attracted several famous delicatessens.  There are now branches of Stage Deli, Carnegie Deli and Canter's Deli.  Canter's is a branch of a famous Los Angeles deli; the other two are based in New York.  Sorry, New York, but LA's representative wins.  This isn't because Canter's is stellar, but because the other two are pretty bad.

In several meals, the standout was a warm pastrami sandwich.  The meat was warm, reasonably juicy and flavorful; the rye bread was thick cut, dense, with a chewy crust.  Other meals weren't as good.  Chopped liver was fair, with not a whole lot of flavor.  The same was true of cheese blintzes.  All servings were very large; I once would have said huge, but I now reserve that term for Carnegie Deli's obscenely sized sandwiches.",0
trn_6620,"Harkin's Superstition 25 is one of my favorite places to go see movies. I love how it's HUGE with 25 theaters!! It even has a bar which is cool. They are quick with getting you your tickets & I like how it's so big & roomy that it doesn't seem crowded even when a lot of people are there.

Today when we saw our movie, it took a while in the popcorn line. There were a lot of cashiers, but they would say they were not open or you would see another one counting money from their register & they were closed. That's why I deducted a star & gave them 4 stars. If the cashiers are on the floor, they should be ready to go & help customers. That way, the wait won't be as long. The staff is friendly and I love how this Harkin's has a good variety in the movies that they show, so I will be back!",1

trn_6627,"I feel like my family and I have gave this business a chance (since they've been okay to us in previous years, not to mention how they're less than a few blocks from where we live) but I feel this business is failing. We had taken our vehicle in for a simple oil change (we were going on a trip and wanted to be safe) after getting the oil change, our vehicle started to stall, and not want to start up, eventually we took it back, and to their surprise nothing was wrong with it, I felt like ""Did they even check it?"" Frustrated, we took our vehicle back home (thankfully it started) yet the problems still happened, and Brake masters had no answers. The next time we took another one of our vehicles to the shop since it was having a problem that needed immediate attention, we took it to Brake Masters at 5:10ish (they CLOSE at 5:30) they rejected us, and said we can bring it back in the morning, and that they were closed, I felt that a business is has hours of operations for the customers regardless if they close in 15 minutes or close in 2 hours, they did not even want us to leave the vehicle there overnight. I will NEVER do business again with this company (or this location). We ended up calling AAA and having it towed to their business. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS!!!! They come off as nice guys but in the end they're lazy mechanics.",-1
trn_6628,"This restaurant wins all around.

The staff share the responsibility of all tables, so you are never begging for attention...or more of your beverage.

The food was yummy (we had a pizza, the crispy tuscan potatoes and a caesar salad)!

The design/layout is great.  It felt like you were in a swanky loft in NYC...normal kitchen islands, cabinetry, etc.

All of these for very reasonable prices.  Our total bill was less than $50, and that included 2 non-alcoholic (boooooring) drinks on top of the food mentioned.

Great place to eat if you're on the strip and hungry for a sit-down dinner with quality food!",1

And seriously, the hamburger was so greasy that it seeped into the bun, which turned into a glob. So disgusting. Spoke with the manager and he gave me a 5 dollar gift certificate. Yahoo...NOT! As hard as he tried to be nice about the whole thing, I think he was a bit agitated that I was cutting into his football game. Ugh!!",-1
trn_6632,"I love the lasagna here. Also the fact that they have a gluten free crust, and that they have pizza by the slice. Great lunch specials, and the prices otherwise aren't too bad. 
Not a big fan of the pizza though. The crust has little flavor, and the sauce isn't that good either. They do use a good cheese though!
Try the pasta, and you won't be disappointed. The pizza, not so awesome.",0

trn_6637,"The weirdest parking garage at a casino ever. It was so packed that we had to go to the top- but the elevator doesn't reach that level. Coming back- you have to go to the next to the last level, and walk up there. It was confusing. Why the heck did they design this parking lot so poorly? It is so complicated to get a parking space that we haven't been here in years. It's also very small. I've heard that employees have a hard time finding a parking spot as well. There is only one store I like anyway- Dooney & Bourke. Yes, the gondola ride is neat but it's $15.00 each for a ten minute ride, with singing. I guess if you were to do this once, it'd be ok. It's kinda pricey, I'm just saying. I will say that the casino is pretty, though.",0
trn_6638,Blah.  I expected a lot of flavor but the food was very bland.  Ceviche was good as a starter.  My short ribs were under seasoned and lukewarm.  My wife's shrimp dish was okay but lackluster and was also served nearly room temperature.  Our server was friendly and the manager greeted us but people were seated inches away from us though the restaurant was nearly empty. $16 sangria was essentially white wine with a few bits of fruit thrown in for looks.,-1
trn_6639,"This place has some amazing unique food options on the menu. I am a HUGE sushi fan and tend to stick to the same things when I go places. This time my boyfriend and I decided to try some different things, best decision ever. Everything we had was scrumptious. His personal favorite was the Carnival Roll, the yellow seaweed wrap made the presentation even better. We also got the Neo Tokyo, which is like a spicy tuna roll but WAY better. The BoBo Brazil was one I had read about on here by another reviewer, which I am glad I did. The sauce on top really did the trick. We also go the Avocado Salmon Roll because it's my two favorite things put together!  I would recommend this place to any sushi lover who wants to try a little twist, and there are many other options on the menu.",1

trn_6641,"At my second Yelp event ever, I took full advantage of networking with fellow yelpers at the Q&A session (in person meeting) which left a lasting impression. Meeting likeminded individuals seeking world class service anywhere and everywhere leaves one wondering while holding Businesses and Products accountable to excellent service at all times. I am extra precise on whom and where I'd like to spend my time and money particularly in today's economy when times are tough.
 
Yelp at Aveda was nothing less than a successful event starting off with Lindsay; she was a great host!   While mingling with fellow yelpers, we were treated to h'orderves  and champagne - talk about a fountain of knowledge! This was an elite event (I yet have been able to earn the honor), but I am working diligently to do so! So watch out - I am determined to join your inner circle of trust (hopefully it's as good as the circle of trust in Meet The Parents).
But back to Aveda - the building itself has character its down town Mill Ave; historical in nature,  and once you walk in, it's like a breath of fresh air -trendy, hipster meets oasis loft ready to pamper your every whim!

Went a safe route and got the cookies and cream made with Newman's Os.  It was delicious!  They have a whole menu (front and back) of blizzard flavors, and you can customize if you want.  Best of all, my 6 year old said it was better than Dairy Queen.  Yeah!!!",1
trn_6647,"I grew up in NM, and this place has some great food that tastes a lot like home - Mexican food that has much bolder and better flavors than a lot of the other ""Mexican"" restaurants found around Phoenix.

I had the machaca enchiladas with red and green chile, and both chile sauces were excellent.  I'm tired of so many restaurants that don't have a green chile sauce but instead serve some green tomatillo stuff, and the New Mexican Grill was welcome relief with their sauce that is delicious.

The mild salsa was good, but I'd like to see the same thing with a medium or hot version.  The hot salsa was a more liquid-type of salsa which I'd give 3/5 stars.

Refried beans were 4/5, and the rice was slightly lacking in flavor, but still tasty enough I cleaned my plate.

I was very satisfied with the value here - good portion size for the price, and delicious.",1
trn_6648,"It's nice, it's clean, it's about average for an AMerican Mexican resturant.  Doesn't strike me as all that authentic but my husband, who leans more towards the AMricanized Mexican food absolutely LOVES the Sonoran Enchilada.  He calls it ""Mexican beefy goodness"" and we make special trips from AJ just to get it.  Personally, and I can always find something there to eat, think it's just ok.",1
trn_6649,I first went to this place in the summer and wasn't too impressed by my consultation and brow shaping. But when I went back today I was very pleased with the job Kylie did.

trn_6653,"Dining in the dark - it sounds novel until you actually do it...
Meeting my server, he escorted my wife and I to our table. Going through the first door left us in a reasonably dark space. Only after going through the second door were we immersed in pitch darkness. Our server Nasir was incredibly gracious. Following his direction we were able to sit comfortably at our table and discover our utensils. We had to come to grips with the floodgate of emotions that consumed us. Understand that there will be an initial psychological impact on being in the dark. A sense of helplessness and despair may overwhelm you. It will cease to be fun early on. However, if you are going to endure you must embrace it. After about 15 minutes of conversation and holding my wife's hand, we were able to relax enough to have conversations throughout dinner. 

The Experience: Eating without vision for those with sight is mind bending. Although you know what you ordered, where it is placed on the plate and what it looks like is an unknown. There must be a tremendous sense of faith and trust in not only your unseeing server, but also the preparation team. You soon determine placement of what you will need to eat - your utensils, your drink, your plate and eventually each food article - visualizing based upon touch and memory. Your sense of smell is not as keen as you think it is. The sense of touch actually drove much of my engagement with the food. Mouth-feel was very important as I attempted to identify what I was eating based upon how it tasted and felt in my mouth. I felt clumsy often groping in the darkness. Because I could not adequately use my fork, I eventually put it to the side to use my hands. Yet, a deep sense of appreciation for those whose lives are enveloped in blackness soon made its way into my heart. The experience was eye-opening.

The Food: For a starter I had the arugula salad and roasted peppers. It is difficult to go wrong with a salad and they did not disappoint. I would have preferred it without the mushrooms. I'm not a fan and don't like the mouth feel. The peppers were delicious, boasting a decent blend of sweet and bitter. The goat cheese was a tad overwhelming. Yet, all-in-all it was quite tasty. For a main dish I had the filet with potatoes and vegetables. The meat was prepared perfectly, with a pepper rub that gave it a nice pop. The potatoes and vegetables (green beans) were standard course. For dessert, you can't go wrong with a fruit sorbet.

Overall: It was an eye-opening experience. The food was good. The environment ""uncomfortable"". It often felt that the meal was prolonged in order for me to fully experience the impact of eating in darkness. A typical three course meal takes my wife and I about 1 hour. This took 1.5 hours. We spent a lot of time waiting between courses. It was great for conversation. However, it does lend itself to obsessing on the environment. The lit lounge was dimly lit which was not that inviting. It appeared well lit after being in a veil of darkness for the meal. A balance would have been appreciated. All-in-all, good food, unique experience; I recommend everyone eat there at least once.",0
trn_6654,"Great beer lists, best onion rings in town and a menu with something for everyone that features local ingredients.",1
trn_6655,"I have been staying here for work for the last couple of weeks and this is a nice place.  The rooms are large and quiet, however a walk in shower would be a great additional feature.  Who doesn't hate taking a shower in a bathtub!

I was able to stay as an Platinum Elite guest and have access to the complimentary lounge on the 12th floor.  You need a elite key to access the 12th floor and the lounge.  The lounge is pretty large with televisions, newspapers, free drinks along with daily breakfast, some hot entrees at dinner and deserts.  The hostess for the lounge works split shifts so she is there for 6am breakfast and 5:30pm dinner to great you with a welcome and a smile.

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful whenever I needed assistance.  The Hotel itself is located across the street from the downtown amphitheater so it is a good spot to stay if your in town for a event or concert.  I haven't seen or done much in Phoenix but the Marriott seems like a pretty solid option for a stay.",1
trn_6656,"A perfect example of Vegas' neighborhood eatery.  Small, welcoming, friendly, serving food with attitude.

What do Korean, Filipino, Peruvian and down home American food have in common?  NOTHING.  Except that they are all on the same menu at Served.
 
Not to fear, non-American dishes are not 100 percent authentic but represent well.  They are all boldly flavored with no regard if they pair with one another or not.  With their large portions, there is very little chance you'll be ordering two mains at the same time.

Note:  Breakfast review (the full starters and lunch specials menu is also available).

The comp, crispy cinnamon dusted flour tortilla chips are crack in a basket and a great way to whet the palate.

As a starter, the loaded truffle parm nuggets with roasted wild mushrooms is solid and actually as advertised.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside Yukon gold wedges, and a plethora of meaty, well seasoned wild mushrooms dressed with real truffle oil and a load of parm.  A handful of vegetal micro greens adds freshness.  Good eats.

For mains, it's all about the bennies.  All showcase a well made hollandaise with just the right touch of tarragon vinegar and beautiful, soft poached eggs with perfectly fluffy whites.  The base differs to best suit the dish.  All just work once the egg yolk is burst and mixed with everything.  For example, the ""Turf Side"" with sliced filet, aggressively seasoned, EVOO coated, roasted mushrooms, on grilled sourdough; burst the yolks, mix it up, the flavors blend beautifully.  The same is true for the ""Korean Spicy Pork"".  Juicy, spicy, slightly sweet, well marinated pieces of grilled pork atop crisp shrimp rice balls.  Again, burst the yolk for creamy richness that reduces the spice and blends it well with the seafood.  Micro greens garnish all dishes not only making them look good but to add freshness.  

Tip:  Wednesday is Industry Day.  Check with the servers for rotating specials.

Limited list of libations including a bottomless mimosa (orange or guava) option.

Vegas style start to the day done right.",1

trn_6659,"This little unassuming place was the absolute bomb. Struck up a conversation with the sweet and savvy owner, Jean, and she gave me the most personalized attention I have ever gotten while shopping. She observed my body type, the kinds of cuts, colors, and styles I was picking up, and was not pushy or argumentative when I didn't like something. When the belt I loved was just a tiny bit too big, she put another hole in it, no problem. She greeted every customer that came in and made sure they knew they could ask her for anything. I know it doesn't have to do with clothes, but I asked her (because she is from Hong Kong) where to get the best chinese food in downtown Toronto, and she not only asked what we liked, wrote down an address and three off-the-menu dishes in Chinese to give to the waiter, she called the restaurant to check their prices and make sure they hadn't changed their menu. This store may be small, and the one-size clothing may be a turnoff to some people, but if you're looking for true customer service and fun, feminine clothing, this is your place.",1

As much as I pay you each year for a cake and cupcakes ($150+) the least you could do is make it fresh or tell me I can't have the cupcakes fresh..... I never would have ordered them.

The order was ready in 15 mins even tho when I showed up, the place was pretty full.

trn_6667,Had a great date night with my husband. The macadamia nut halibut was wonderful. Server was great and gave us plenty of personal space. We told him we were not in any hurry and he respected that. My only concern was the abrupt /rude hostess when I called to make the reservation. Not friendly or welcoming at all. But on a good note the bartender and waiter made up for the lack of the hostess. Food was wonderful!,1
trn_6668,"So glad my husband and I stumbled across this place.  We both loved the atmosphere and it was very cozy.

The place is bigger than you think.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different  bourbon drinks being made.  I absolutely loved that the drinks were served in a mason jar.  Even the ice wasn't standard cubes but were oversized cubes or a sphere depending on your drink choice.  I had the blackberry bourbon lemonade and the southern peach.  Both drinks were wonderful and while having a lot of flavors, the bourbon was able to be showcased.  

They have a large beer menu as well.

The deviled eggs were delicious and not just your standard devil egg.  They were full of flavor and very elaborate in there presentation.

For the main course we got the fried chicken and the mamas chicken biscuits.  The chicken is SO good.  Fried just enough for flavor but so tender!  The chicken biscuits were amazing!

Although the we had tried so much stuff, we couldn't help but get dessert to go.  Chocolate bread pudding and butterscotch cake.  Both had unique flavors and were great. 

You can't go wrong trying this place out.  The extensive southern choices along with great service gives you a hometown feel while being in Vegas. Everyone was friendly and knowledgable; as each plate is delivered they describe each item.  Top notch!",1
trn_6669,I came here a couple of weeks ago and instead of skipping over their Weight Watchers menu I actually tried something on it. They had two salads on there that sounded interesting one had fruit in it and the other one had steak and potatoes. I tried the one with steak and potatoes of course! It was different but it felt like a whole meal and it was good! The salad also had fresh spinach and finished off by a tasty vinaigrette that I wouldn't mind having again!,1

trn_6672,"I'm always one to give a place the benefit of the doubt, so after one horrible visit to Pickle Bills, I reluctantly agreed to go back when a friend decided to have a birthday dinner there. Never again. The food is awful.The drinks are awful. The service is awful. Oh and did I mention the food is awful? I don't get how anyone could want to come here. Sure, the atmosphere is kinda funky (and kinda dirty), and i'ts great being on the lake, but c'mon-nothing tasted fresh, from the seafood to the sides. I had a taste of pretty much everything our party ordered and this was true of everything. Soggy salads, watery, tasteless chowder, old tasting seafood. I am a huge seafood lover and there is no reason to sell frozen products in a restaurant that is supposed to be known for their seafood. 
For the life of me, I just don't get it.",-1
trn_6673,Went in for lunch special of General Tsos chicken....I dont know what's changed but it tastes like shit! The dish is supposed to have chicken..its nothing bit balls of flour tossed in the sauce. The rice is supposed to be fried rice....its white rice colored brown with who knows what. I'm disappointed and will not be returning ever again to this place. AJK is way better than this.,-1

Last time I called them, I waited almost an hour and it turned out they had me call in because they wanted to sell me some promotional credit card. NOT WORTH THE DISCOUNTS!",-1
trn_6675,"There were four of us who decided last minute to go out for dinner. We wanted to try a restaurant that we had never been to before. On a Saturday night at 6 p.m. we arrived at D.C. Steak House. They were already filling up and had many reservations. The hostess was kind enough to work things out to accommodate our party. From the moment that we met the hostess and the minute we paid our bill we had an enjoyable dinner with delicious food, outstanding service and friendliness from every employee we encountered. The steak and prime rib was fabulous. My husband and friend each has fish entrees. One was walleye and the other was an evening special. They were both delicious as well. I highly recommend D.C. Steak House and encourage you to make a reservation. We were so lucky that the hostess went out of her way to get us in. We WILL be back!",1

trn_6678,"I had an awful experience at Tommy Guns crowfoot today. I called beforehand to see if it would be ok to bring my 14 month old son in for a haircut. I explained in advance that if he was disruptive in any way, they could ask me to leave. The woman I spoke to (I believe her name was Vicky said that since the shop wasn't busy, it would be fine to bring him in. When I brought my son in, he started to cry and scream during the service. No one asked me to leave, and the hair stylist cut his hair as best she could. The same woman, Vicky, was behind me while his hair was being cut, and she was giving a dirty look behind my back and the only reason I knew she was doing this was because my sister was with me. Upon returning home, I realized his hair was extremely un even (understandable) and I went in and asked if there was anyway to fix it. The same woman I spoke with on the phone (Vicky) said they would try to fix it. Then she interrupted me and proceeded to tell me that my nursing bra was unhooked, and that I should fix it before anything 'came out' of my shirt. Totally embarrassing and unprofessional. I then asked for my money back, which she gave with no objection. My sister who I was with said to her that her customer service was terrible. It wasn't even the fact that my sons hair looked terrible, it was the way in which I was treated by this woman. She tried to tell me that I should have left, and that I was disturbing 'paying customers'. Im a paying customer myself so I found that ridiculous. I also told her that she had no right to comment on my appearance, to which she replied 'if my bra was hanging out I would want to know.' I'm not even going to go into every ridiculous comment she made, but I just want to warn anyone who is thinking of going here, please don't waste your time or money.",-1
trn_6679,"Everything about this place is awesome! From the owners Keith & Patti & their 2 canine kids who are Rottweilers, hence the name Rott N Grapes, to the amazing bartenders Amy & Sam who serve a huge variety of wines and craft beers... it's a cozy microbar with indoor & outdoor seating hidden in a mid century high rise called Landmark Towers located  on Central Ave south of Camelback...another plus is its within walking distance of the light rail station that also has bike rentals so no driving required! They serve a few delicious hors d'oeuvres that compliment the wine & beer served and if you're in the mood for sushi, you can have it delivered from Yama sushi located next door! if you like to socialize this place is for you! I would describe it as a speakeasy that serves alcohol legally....if you've not discovered this place yet, you need to... amazing happy hour from 3 to 8... CHECK IT OUT!!!",1

trn_6682,"I was sucked in by the 5 star reviews. I went in person to order a birthday cake for my wife.  After ordering, they called me back about 15 minutes later, advising they didn't have any vanilla (??) but could make the cake with chocolate chocolate chip ice cream.  I agreed.  They told me the cake would be ready at 4pm the following day (my wife's birthday).  

I arrive at 4:30PM and there is a sign up ""sorry ran out of ice cream"". Knocked on the window and got someone to come out.  Told him I had a cake to pick up.  He went in the back and then called someone on the phone.  Then came to the front and said ""sorry it didn't get made"". So 4:30pm and they couldn't have told me this a LOT earlier, before I drove all the way out to pick it up?  

So they received my money anyway, as I made the mistake of buying a Yelp ""deal"".  Which is $15 for nothing but a headache in my case.  

Thank God for the Cold Stone on Power Road in Queen Creek! They had a pre-made cake and even decorated it for me at 5:30pm.  

Never again guys. Fool me once, shame on you.",-1
trn_6683,"Came here for a conference in early January. 

We were 4 people per room. The rooms had 2 double beds. It was a bit tight, but two people per bed is doable. You just have to not be afraid to be a bit close. Hey, you can always make a pillow wall! 

The amenities were nice and they even had a little lavender rub for your temples to help you sleep. Not sure if it was effective, but it was a nice little touch. 

Something that really bothered me was that there were no slippers! I thought that was a must for all hotel rooms! 

Other than that, the bed was comfortable and the room temperature was nice and it was adjustable. 

The staff was very patient and they showed me the way around when I got lost. They even let us to take a look at the toula restaurant to check out the view! 

The conference rooms are nice, not much to say there. 

All in, it was a very good stay! No great, but definitely not bad",0

trn_6686,"While traveling to Austin for a conferee I had a strong craving for fro yo. Lucky for me there was a place within walking distance of the hotel. 
Compared to the fro yo I'm used to in Austin this isn't good. The flavors are basic with no creativity and the taste is just okay. The consistency when it comes out of the machine is a little weird and not smooth like I'm used to. 
I had the Vanilla bean and dark chocolate with PB chips, chocolate baking chips, And M&Ms...this gal loves her chocolate. There is a plus side...when I tracked the calories it was pretty low so I guess all hope wasn't lost. Although I wasn't too concerned with calories at that point...I just needed some dang on fro yo. 
I wasn't impressed with the two teeny bopper employees either. 1. I see you peeping from behind the machines to see if anyone just entered the store 2. It wasn't necessary to just disappear after unwillingly asking me if I needed anything. 3. Why the hell is this yogurt $.55/ounce AND why is that not posted anywhere!? 

In closing, I'm sure if you're from Charlotte this is great. However if fro yo is a big deal in your city like it is in mine then this is a no go.",-1

trn_6688,I started off with the famous Bloody mary! The presentation was hilarious! The flavor was delicious and was very fresh with a little spice. I ordered the signature cheeseburger topped with Mac-n-cheese. The plate when served is very appealing. The burger appears to be intimidating but once you cut it in half it's really not too big. The beef is juicy and tender. The sandwich has great flavor and was a perfect balance of flavors. I only ate half the sandwich which is just the right amount of food. The fries served with the sandwich are a mix of different types of cuts and seasoning.  It's creative and I will be back.,1

I've enjoyed all the dishes (even the overcooked beef) and feel like this is really what simple food is all about. There's no fussy sauces or fusion ingredients, and that's exactly what I want when I am craving something that a grandmother would make me - and in this case, she would of course, be Vietnamese. The pork in the sandwich was different to the traditional mix of cold-cuts/pâté that you'd normally find, it was more of a grilled pork, if I'm not mistaken. They were both heartier versions of the traditional Vietnamese sub sandwich. The noodle soup's broth had depth and good flavor to it, and I didn't feel like adding much to it besides a squeeze of lime and a dash of Hoisin.
The prices are more than reasonable, so it's really a fantastic alternative to fast food.",1
trn_6691,"I'm going to make this short, because honestly this place isn't even worth the time I'm taking to write this review. Husband and I waited outside for 15 - 20 minutes and then seated in front. Awkward bench seating at two wobbly tables pushed together. Server was very friendly and coffee was great....that's about where our enjoyable experience ends. Waited quite a while for such a small place. Got the wild blueberry pancakes that had no flavor and were tough, over-mixed, and overcooked. Husband ordered the typical, nothing fancy breakfast - brown on the outside and way to soft on the inside scrambled eggs, way over peppered and tough sausage (they make it there, which would be great if they actually tasted good), home fries burnt and inedible. He couldn't stomach any of it and sent it back with another server and I ate one of the four pancakes. It was bad enough that the food was your typical over-hyped yupster garbage, but what really pissed me off was that our previously friendly server didn't even come to see us when the other server brought the food back and obviously informed her of our dissatisfaction. I still left her a tip because I'm not an asshole, but she did nothing to earn it. Needless to say, we won't be back and we'll make sure to tell our friends.",-1
trn_6692,"Have been craving authentic Mexican food since my trip to Seattle and this place hit the spot. The owner was very friendly and explained the menu thoroughly. They have an interesting variety of Mexican sodas. On the menu are burritos, tacos, mexicana style sandwiches, and nachos. Out of those my favorites are the mushroom and pulled pork tacos. The guacamole is also the best I've had in a long time. Hoping they get enough demand so they can add grilled fish tacos to the menu. Great food, excellent service. I'm going to be back many times I'm sure.",1
trn_6693,"Ha. Hahahahaha. HA!

Hilarious performance art masquerading as an Italian restaurant. I get it - I just had no idea that the Charlotte art scene had gotten so avant garde. 

No? You're telling me this place isn't an elaborate prank on unsuspecting diners? Well dang. Then this might just be the single worst Italian dining experience from a local Italian restaurant I have ever had. From the service to the overpriced mediocre food to the atmosphere this place is a total and complete bust. 

The server we had was completely unhelpful and literally wouldn't take our appetizer order until we ordered the entire meal because they were ""really busy and couldn't handle it."" (Yes, really, a direct quote. Mind you that all the tables weren't even full and this was a Friday evening...so I don't even understand what would happen if you went on a less staffed night.) The food was horrible from the appetizer to the entree and we couldn't even stomach risking spending another penny on dessert because the entire meal was so blah. I don't know if it's policy or not at this restaurant but my water was brought out and never once filled again, and looking around at the other tables this was the case for them as well. 

The inside is a weird combination of decorations and the outside patio sits right in the middle of a parking lot...no ambiance in either location. 

I could probably go on and on and on about how horrible this place is but the bottom line is this: avoid at all costs. Hell, go buy a bottle of Ragu at the next door Harris Teeter and save yourself the money and agony of dining at this establishment. I can assure you you wouldn't notice the difference.",-1

trn_6697,"Somewhat Dutch / Belgian themed but overall is Modern American food. Large portions with a giant menu covering everything from BBQ to Belgian frites to seafood boils and curries. I had one of their fancier burgers and it was very average.

Enormous interior, two stories, high ceilings - modern build out. The menu is enormous - my biggest pet peeve. Pretty much everything can be had: burgers, sandwiches, salads, Belgian frites, soups, seafood, curries, barbecue, Italian food, hot wings. 

Beer list was somewhat impressive with a good amount of Belgian imports on draft as well as local beers like New Glarus. Beers were in good shape and served in correct glassware.

I ordered the Buttery Brie Burger, $14, and it was very average. I didn't think the beef quality was that great and the sauces and cheese didn't make up for it.

Our server was very friendly and outgoing. However, the food took awhile to come out.",0

I wanted so badly to like Gigi's because the presentation of them was gorgeous (hence the 2 stars). However, after getting both sets of cupcakes home and dividing them in fourths so that we could all sample each flavor and compare ""apples to apples"". Gigi's Cupcakes were dry and crumbly...They lacked any flavor at all and the frosting tasted like lard. We ended up ordering cupcakes from the other cupcake shop after everyone in the family agreed - Gigi's has a great LOOK but now they need to focus on their TASTE!",-1

I recently had a small problem at one of the restaurants; but the customer service by John, one of the Las Vegas area co-founders, was unparalleled to anything experienced previously from any other LV restaurants. What was most impressive was that he reached out to me and was proactive about taking care of me and my family and making sure we were satisfied with Metro Pizza. Not only am I extremely impressed, I'm very thankful. John's concern was genuine and he earnestly took care of us.
Definitely actions that went above and beyond the call of duty, and yet another reason to tell all your friends to support Metro Pizza!",1

trn_6704,"One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we've ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can't have since I'm pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn't sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the ""Natural Chicken"" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he's torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he's ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical. 
Toward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, ""Dessert is on me, pick what you'd like!"" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn't understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said ""Congratulations!"" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos. 
Suffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great.",1

trn_6706,"After weeks of going back and forth, back and forth and checking tons of reviews, we decided to go check out the Arrogant Butcher ourselves. The reviews on here (Yelp!) were kinda all over the place so we weren't sure what to expect. Any-who, we came to the conclusion that: 

1. The decor is pretty darn awesome.

2. The waitstaff was good. The place was fully staffed and timing on everything was good.

3. Reservations may not be such a bad idea. We made one at six and it was pretty dead in there when we arrived. However, by the time we left around 7:15, it was full. We went on a Saturday (no games of any sort going on downtown either).

4. WAY overpriced. Our breakdown: 3 cocktails, an appetizer, 3 mussels...$1 a pop, an entree (we split it) and 2 desserts = $100 without tip.

5. Filet was not worth it. At $29 bucks, you would expect something much more. It was overcooked and while the menu made it sound like it came with potatoes, it was more or less a small amount of pureed/creamed potatoes.

6. Drinks, appetizers and desserts were all awesome.

One Monday afternoon, my boyfriend was craving some cheap breakie food so we wanted to come back from the amazing experience we had last. The menu Is extensive and they had a huge variety from sandwiches, soup, breakfast , pasta...

At least that's what I thought...

Me:""may I please have an order of the fish and chips""
Lady :""ok...no problem""... She then walks into the kitchen and came back out.. ""Sorry. No fish and chips today.. Only Friday and Sundays.""
Me:"" ok.. Then can I please get a burger.. Make my fries a poutine please !""
Lady:"" we don't have cheese curds""
Me :"" I'm fine with marble cheese""
Lady:""we don't carry that either. Just cheddar cheese. ""
Me :"" ok that's fine""
Lady : comes back in a few minutes ""sorry we don't have burgers today.""
Me:... ""So.. What do you have?""
Lady : ""just wraps , sandwiches , and breakfast ""
Me: "" ok... I'll have the steak sandwich done rare please... With a ceasar salad.
Lady :""no ceasar salad""
Me :""ok then. Just boring plain fries.""

After 20 minutes do patiently waiting, my food finally came out. Steak cold. But at least my fries were warm... But we I indulge in my cold steak. Found a little hairy surprise.

trn_6723,"I've been fortunate enough to dine here three times since it's opening. Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen is located inside The Quad Hotel & Casino. If you're familiar with Guy Fieri on TV and his personality. You will see it echoed prominently in the look & design of his restaurant. Even the attitude & energetic atmosphere exuded by the employees represent Guy Fieri's style. Of course, if you find Guy Fieri's persona & shows unappealing, this would not be the place for you.
I've tried the Tatted-up Turkey burger, '67 Cajun chicken sandwich & mac & cheese bacon burger entrees. All were awesome, full of flavor. Each comes with a fry mix & the burgers are massive. The mac & cheese was quite rich. Some might find it too much so, but heck, theres mac & cheese in there, what do you expect right? The '67 surprised me in that the blackened chicken was super tender & cooked perfectly.  And a tasty turkey burger is always a good thing.
Their appetizers were all very yummy too. My favorites are the Rojo Rings, onion rings that come hanging on a pipe accompanied by a sriracha ketchup. The Guy-talian fondue dippers, giant breadstickers wrapped in pepperoni with a sausage & provolone cheese dip. I was even dipping my fries in the cheesy dip 'cause I loved it so much.
Waiters & servers were very attentive & lively. I was also fortunate enough to meet Mike, the manager of the establishment. I would be willing to go out of my way to The Quad just to come to Guy Fieri's. I do find it interesting that one of the low end hotel casinos on the strip is home to two great food spots. Hash House and here. Definitely earns a 5 star rating in my book!",1
trn_6724,"It sure is a high-end steakhouse but the food didn't blow our mind. Great appetizer, the size of the steak was good as well as the seasoning, yummy desserts, and a nice wine. The server Andrew was impeccable.  But for the price you pay (especially the steak), you can easily have the same meal at another place for a decent price. 

Not worth the money and not coming back.",0
trn_6725,The food was great and the chip sampler was a great idea and should be done at all Mexican restaurants. Didn't care for the Bama stuff lol. But I was in my Buckeye gear anyways!,1
trn_6726,"Very gorgeous restaurant. The hummus and veggies we ordered before our meal was amazing and so was the bread and pesto provided. You can tell how fresh everything is. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and, while it was delicious, the blue cheese was completely overwhelming. There are so many delicious pieces to the salad that I was looking forward to- the peanut granola being one- and I could not taste any of them but the cheese! I will definitely try them out again though, a drink, appetizer and salad for around $30 was not bad. The coffee bar was amazing too. Got a little latte to go!",0
trn_6727,"We ordered take out based on the decent reviews but unfortunately this was not our experience. Indian Gate certainly knows how to charge ... $113.00 for a dinner for 4 .... not only was it overpriced but the quality was extremely poor and the quantity of protein in the meals was a joke   6 small chicken wings for $13.00  and the quantity of protein in each entrée was embarrassing for example the butter chicken may have been 1 chicken breast cut up in pieces at most.... we were embarrassed  as we bought dinner for our friends and they had to be careful of how much food to take .... ...

I hope the owner reads this review and contacts us as deserve one big apology..... ....",-1
trn_6728,"There's nothing like a good pizza and some wine... =)

My boyfriend bought a groupon for this place so we came here for our date this past weekend. I really liked the setting and outdoor patio of the place. A really good date spot or even a place to get together with friends for dinner. The downside was that their air conditioner was down! We are in Arizona so you can imagine how hot it was. It was actually cooler outside than it was inside. Thank god for those water misters! lol. 

We ordered the Toscana pizza and a pitcher of the White Sangria to wash it down. This place actually reminded me of Sauce. They have the thin crust pizza. I really liked it. Ours was more of a Supreme pizza so it had all the toppings that I loved on it. The Sangria was also tasty. Not too sweet like it usually is. 

I felt like the customer service was a bit slow. It was a bit busy when we were there so that's understandable. It took them a while to come over to our table just to get our drink orders. When we requested to get some balsamic vinegar with our bread the waitress forgot about it but she did apologize when she finally brought it to us. 

Despite the a/c being down and the customer service being a bit slow I would come back. I really liked the food as well as the ambiance of the restaurant. =)",1
trn_6729,"This place is a AVOID AT ALL COST! I booked a car with theses guys and I show up and they would not rent the car to me. I had already prepaid ,  making me trying to arrange another rental and would not give me a reason is ridiculous! The manager, this guy named Riley Fairchild is completely unprofessional and should never be promoted unless he improves himself as a human being from the core. There is another associate named Peter, who refused to give me a last name, I guess he had something to hide. The guy was completely disrespectful to me and my wife from the start. The man has no business in customer service and should be relieved post haste. I want to give this dumb and dumber duo zero stars but yelp was too kind! Avoid!",-1

Fajitas with more peppers and onions than meat. And waiters with personalities of an unsalted cracker just don't cut it for me. What I would do for a Javier's of Orange County CA in Charlotte.

Only thing this place has going for it is the darling decor. That is not enough to ever bring us back.",-1
trn_6734,"So I had a free breakfast here and tried it out.  It's a standard breakfast buffet with the usual eggs, bacon, sausages, home fries, some baked items, some fruit and some cereal.

The odd breakfast buffet can be awesome but this one was definitely not.  Some of the items tasted funny and others tasted exactly like you would expect, being heated from underneath.

Breakfast buffets are a terrible standard to be reviewing a restaurant by so I apologize but can only tell you to avoid it.  However if you don't want to get a crappy review for a breakfast buffet would it not make more sense to move to an a la carte menu?",-1

My daughter asked for vegan bread for her burger. The bread did not look like focaccia bread and I told her to double check. Lucky we did because she was served the non-vegan buttermilk roll. The guacamole chili fries were really good! The red potato burger was just okay, nothing special. We could not try the deserts because they did not have an ingredient list. Overall we were disappointed.",0

I've never been any kind of oatmeal fan, but this amazing combo of chicken stock, oats, braised kale and fried egg has me singing its praises with a convert's zeal. I often need to work through lunch on various events, and the savory oat bowl *easily* keeps me going until suppertime, with maybe an apple or two along the way.  It's a perfect breakfast, and a great value.",1
trn_6739,"You wouldn't expect it, but the ribs here are amazing.  The fried tofu is great, the sauce they have is sweet and sour, but a nice bitter note to cut it off(for another bite).  I really love spicy food, so I enjoy being able to just get the spiciest versions of their dishes.",1
trn_6740,"I can not attest to the food as I was never served.  
I was asked to leave this establishment based on my level of intoxication.   As a former bar manger I found this discretion odd, especially considering my intake of only 3 beers during the 4 hours of a Pittsburg Pirates game.   
I was legally able to navigate a motor vehicle, but I was unable to eat a bowl spaghetti at this restaurant.   
I asked to speak to the manager and asked why we would not be served.  Blame was passed to the server who passed it back to the manager who had zero explanation.  Zero.    
The only thing that makes any sense to us was that they close at midnight and we showed up at 11.   
If you don't want to serve food past a certain point then don't, but don't insult the people who have decided to dine at your establishment.  
I am personally embarrassed and completely disappointed in how the server and his manager handled the situation.  
As a business owner myself I feel bad for the owner of this business that has enlisted these people to take care of his business.",-1

BUT the last time I ordered there, my mom, brother and I decided to eat there. We ordered two dishes, the butter chicken, and a roti. First, we were ordering at the counter, and the phone would ring and the guy would spend massive times on the phone, not talking to a customer. Second, he wasnt very friendly, he seemed clueless and tired. We came there expecting to take less than an hour to eat. But it took over a half an hour to get our food! It was empty at the time and the kitchen was quiet. Having this much time to sit, bored, I noticed that the place is super out dated and old. But besides all that, I give 5 stars for the food and 1 star for service, I recomend calling and eating at home.",0

trn_6748,"'I do not feel like spending the rest of my life writing books that no one will read. It is not as though I wanted to write them.'

+1 for carrying some of my stuff, and +2 for  selection/layout, but the rest of my used book stars go to price, and i always just end up browsing because i've never come across a bargain,and i still associate used/second hand items with bargains. (some mass marketed paperback classics i've found cheaper brand new online).

i guess this would be akin to the modern ""friperie"", which sell  the same clothes as a real hospital run thrift store/ salvation army. this is more of a boutique 2nd hand book store, old fashioned  name and street and storefront aside, as opposed to  visions of books piled high and only pocket change exchanging hands
.
 if you know how to use the internet or are the type to hunt for deals in places left of center, there's nothing to discover or stumble upon here.

mind you, obtaining books is a story in and of itself, sometimes more interesting than the story that awaits you between the margins, so if you're in the neighborhood, maybe a bagel and book and coffee and jaunt over to a nearby park is greater than clicking  around on the internet. novelty isn't lost on me, okay, it is, but  i'm old.",0

trn_6752,"My husband and I usually go to Sweet Poke, but decided to switch it up and try this place.

I really love the paint splatter decor. It's very colorful. That's primarily the reason we were drawn to check this place out.

They build your order as you pick the meat and fillings that you want. Their tortillas are made from scratch and the ingredients were pretty fresh. The service was pretty quick and the staff was friendly. I ordered a steak quesadilla and my husband ordered the chicken nachos. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't spectacular either. I think of this as an overpriced Chipotle, as you can get similar items at Chipotle for less.

That being said, their horchata is deliciously amazing. I would come here just for that. Their drink fountain bar is pretty cool - they have the generic soda drinks, as well as Mexican drinks (horchata, tamarind) and fresh fruit juices - but you also have the option to customize your drinks by adding flavor shots.

I don't know that I'll be back for their food, but I will definitely come when I'm craving an horchata.",0

trn_6754,"Ok I know this spot gets spotty reviews and I understand it to an extent. The portions aren't that huge,they aren't the most flexible when it comes to substitutions . That being said I actually enjoyed the food here . My mom and brother came here last year and he was underwhelmed about the chicken. I thought it was nicely seasoned and it went well in my dish. I ordered the biscuit and gravy over chicken plate(forgot the actual name of the dish) it was really good and flavorful. The gravy was so creamy and really went good over the biscuits. I didn't understand the jalapeño garnish but I digress. My mom ordered the shrimp and grits. Now I'll admit I'm no grits fan,just don't care for the texture of them. I tasted some of her dish and it was like the best creamiest thing ever. She said the ham was really good. She got it last time she came and kept raving about it. There was something different about these grits . I'm still not a fan lol but I would order the grits dish here. The place is a bit pricey it's in between the Venetian and Palazzo after all lol. But the meal did hit the spot! Now my favorite part was the biscuits. They are so fluffy and they have like a sweet crust that's very faint on top which just makes it awesome especially with the butter spread on. The waiter was cool as well,forgot his name but it was a black man. He made us laugh when he said the waters include,Evian,bottled and Nevada tap . We got the Nevada tap. The ambiance is nice too. It's a bit dark but they have this nice light display above on the ceiling made with mason jars. There is a comfy seating area in the bar area that's nice too. I would come back again!",1

Some great art work including Monet...one of my favorites.  Many other great pieces of art are in the collection at the museum  Also, some newer or rediscoved art is on display.

The museum changes some exhibits during the year.  One of the most enjoyable exhibits to me is the new B&W photograpy...The Teenie Harris photography is fun to see thru someone else's eyes...people...the urban landscape and some old signs in black and white.   

Another exhibit is...Picturing the City...fun great pictures of Pittsburgh and sports fans.

The atmosphere is welcoming, the coffee is fabulous, and the food is fresh!  I had a big bowl of fresh berries (blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries), granola (some of the best I've had ever), and organic yogurt along with a cup of sumatra (medium roast) coffee with some steamed almond milk on the side.

That was the fuel that got me through my morning.  I am happy to see a local business thriving (or at least it appears that way).  I wish Bunna was a tad bit closer to where I live because I'd like to be a regular there too!",1
trn_6762,"For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",-1

I would have left except I made a trip here just to have a slice of Spanish totrtilla. I stood there and waited for him to stop whatever he was doing to help me.           

I've never come across anyone who saw a customer standing there and make them wait without any acknowledgement.

I sat down and he told me he'd bring over my order. It's the first time someone actually didn't bring or offer any milk or sugar.  I walked up to the counter and put some into a napkin. He didn't notice me at all.  he had disappeared in the back somewhere.

He never came back to me. 

a little surprised to see two large dogs let inside a food establishment. they were cute but I thought not too good for health and safety.

Last night just after 5p the garage door wouldn't open, so I called them as I thought it could be related to the new opener.  The guy tells me both springs are broken.  He charged $375 to install two new springs, and it took him less than an hour.  In just researching the average cost of parts and labor for two springs, the average cost is $180-$250.  Wow.  As you can see, significant OVERCHARGING is a common practice with these people.  Do yourself a favor and find someone else.

She apologized then rushed a new order, which later came out burnt! I couldn't eat it. Everyone at my table agreed it was burnt. I would had told her it was burnt but she never came back to check on us. I tried my friends others dishes and they were good! 

Last weekend I actually went again. Same waitress btw. My salad was wrong which she corrected but never checked on us. We waited 20 mins for our check, that's after we finished eating. I'm sure if I had just walked out no one would have noticed. But I don't dine & dash.

trn_6772,"The line moved quickly and after placing my order at the counter, the two ice creams were ready really quickly too!  Considering that there was only one staff manning the cashier and two in the open kitchen behind him, it was a really fast order process!

Fugo's space isn't big and there are only a handful of tables with stools for you to dine in.  Most people order and then go with their ice cream or parfaits.  

As expected, the Cookie Monster Fugo Creation was highly ""instagramable"" /photogenic.  Many people like myself took the photo of this dessert creation against their chalkboard wall.  There was chalk available too for you to leave your own comments or messages too.

There were two scoops of the Cookie Monster ice cream and mini Chips Ahoy Cookies all on an Oreo Fugo Cone.  This was a big portion and if it really weren't for the photo, I could have ordered the one-scoop version.  Upon trying it, I understood why this was so hyped.  The ice cream not only looked good (and cute), but it tasted really good too!  The cookies and cream ice cream was very good and although it was blue, it's not like there was any flavour to the ""blueness"".  The Chips Ahoy Cookies were a good and yummy addition.  The ice cream didn't melt too quickly (a bonus!) and when I finally got to the cone part of the ice cream, the Oreo Fugo Cone was really delicious too.  The Oreo pieces were stuck onto the cone with something that tasted like sweet marshmallows.  After eating this, I'm sure I had a bit of a sugar high. 

The Bangkok Brownie Parfait consisted of Thai tea soft serve, brownie bits, chocolate drizzle, and chocolate wafer stick.  When tasting it, it had a very strong and loud Thai tea flavour.  I was impressed with that! I tasted the brownie bits too and was so satisfied with it too.   

The only thing I would say is that their desserts aren't cheap.  One ice cream creation or parfait was $6.99 and that's before tax.  That could be a cheap meal somewhere.",1

I love this bar because he really keeps us entertained and makes sure we are taken care of.  His fast and pleasant service makes me want to keep coming to Venetian.   Thnk you. VENETIAN for having staff such as Efren.  Five thumbs up,1
trn_6779,"Super excited Katsuya opened up in Mississauga.. though it's not central sauga it's a littttlee further away and I'm never in this area. Literally just came here to try it out. I've been to the Toronto location before and enjoyed my meal there. There's a decent amount of seats avail. We had a reservation for 8pm but was running late so I called and we got there around 830p. Wasn't busy when we got there so we got seated promptly. 

I generally knew what I wanted to order as I looked at the menu online prior. Service was a tad slow with the slow traffic of people. We didn't get a glass of water till literally when we decided to order. Ok whatever nbd. 

I got the garlic chicken katsu and my bf got the chicken carbo. All the dishes here are huge portions so expect to be really full. We really wanted cheese in the chicken but they don't have that option avail for chicken - only for pork. We're not a huge pork fan.

Garlic was.. really. Strong. If you're into super strong garlic smell/taste. Give it a try. I got tired of eating that after 3 strips in.. Rice was meh. Salad was good tho LOL. 
Carbo was HEAVY. I personally am not a fan of seafood so slight whiff of seafood got to me but I still tried it. I could tell 3/4 in my bf was struggling to finish it as the sauce was just that heavy.

3.5* overall.",0
trn_6780,"Don't bother ordering ahead of time. We live nearby and on 3 separate occasions have either placed an online order or called for pick up, but the pizza is never ready when they say it will be. Twice they hadn't even started making the order by the time we got there saying they had an unexpected rush. Then we're promised the pizza will be ready in 15 mins which usually turns into a 30+ minute wait. What's even the point of having an online ordering option? The pizza is okay, but would not be my first choice due to slow service.",-1
trn_6781,"I came for a bachelorette party last week on Friday night around 11pm. My review is probably (ok definitely) biased because I was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. However, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in Vegas is a production equal to Cirque de Solei that takes upward of 3 hours. But whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the Cosmo to the Palazzo hotel.  The restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge TVs which were super loud. Per the usual at many ""sceney"" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. 

We got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where I do not know. There seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. He could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. Whether or not they had liquor was the only question (Answer: not enough.) So we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. After the night's beginning, I opted with straight vodka and diet coke.

For food we got a lot. Some  memorable dishes were the Neo Tokyo roll with tuna which was solid, heirloom tomato salad with sweet cilantro dressing, rock shrimp tempura, mushroom tobanyaki, and sweet coconut rice side. My fave dish of all was the heirloom tomato salad which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. The rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. The mushroom tobanyaki was interesting but not to my taste.  Sadly we did not get dessert. 
In conclusion, I can definitely say i hope I will never be back with another bachelorette party, although I would not mind returning otherwise.",0
trn_6782,"I've been wanting to go to this restaurant ever since I moved to Madison over a year ago.  We had a reservation and even though it was a busy Friday night, we were seated right away, which I can't always say on a busy weekend dinner rush.  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.  I started with the Irish Margarita- Jameson in a marg!  I'm a whiskey fan and it definitely lived up to my expectations.  For my meal, I had the sirloin steak with chimichanga sauce and a side of twice baked potatoes and vegetables.  My fiancee had the NY strip steak.  We both ordered our meat medium, but mine was probably closer to medium rare and my fiancees was practically still mooing.  It was still good, but I was a little upset that they didn't cook it how we asked for it.  I would definitely recommend the chimichanga sauce on the steak; it added the right amount of kick.  While I'm usually not a fan of onions, the twice baked potato had onions, along with I believe chives and cheese, and I ate practically every bite of it, it was so good!  We finished the meal with a dessert shooter- the peanut butter cup.  It was just the right size and a good price as well, $2.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a slightly upscale American dinner restaurant.  I also want to give points for the atmosphere and decor.",1
trn_6783,"I chose this place because it's a Fox concept and reviews were inviting. I ordered beet salad to share. Lettuce and a beet well hidden  was very average. 
I ordered jambalaya and ate about 3 bites. It tasted like a bunch of leftovers put together-no distinct great flavor. We also ordered prime rib dinner, the Saturday night special. Very average served with a Small mound of mashed potatoes. Meat was not tender. We all concurred the meal was very pricey for what showed up. We had invited a special guest and frankly I was  very disappointed. Nothing wrong with the service or waiter.",-1

trn_6785,"Ordered takeout.  Delivered reasonably fast (25 minutes, 10 minutes ahead of estimate).  Order was accurate.  Food was hot.  

Food was very good.   Hot & sour soup has a rich flavor and was nicely spiced, although could be hotter.  Shrimp egg rolls were moist, and the shrimp pieces large and de-veined.  Hot & spicy chicken also had a rich flavor, with plenty of meat balanced with onions, peppers and vegetables.  Could have been a little spicier though.  (Suggest they ask your level of spice when ordering.) 

I'd say this is above average Chinese food for the area, and a great value.  Looking forward to also trying the sushi.  Nice to have another good alternative to Hong Kong Café, which is where I usually eat.",1

trn_6788,"First time reviewer for Yelp... just had to repeat what all the other reviews have said--Biaggio's is the best pizza and sandwiches around!!  Biaggio's rates number 1 in Nevada on Yelp and for good reason... Biaggio really does have the best New York style pizza and sandwiches in all of Las Vegas!  Not that I've tried ever other restaurant, but have tried almost all of the ""top 10""  in LV and Biaggio was my favorite.  My brother and I tried the white pizza, the Philly Cheesesteak and the garlic knots with Biaggio's signature marinara sauce.  All were terrific, as other reviewers can attest.  I'm a huge fan of marinara sauce, and you won't find a better sauce elsewhere!  My brother and I got a chance to talk to the owner for awhile about his restaurant and felt at home, we've never been treated friendlier.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area, you won't be disappointed!",1

trn_6793,"One thing you need in Vegas is a 24 hour dining option. And if you're on the Strip, Peppermill is a phenomenal option. There's two sides to the place.  One is the Fireside Lounge, which has a wonderful 80s retro vibe to it, especially with the lighting.

The restaurant side is where I went, though.  The menu is pretty typical of a lot of the 24 hour diner options -- an expansive menu of appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts.  My French Dip was excellent especially with swiss cheese and mushrooms, both of which were extra.  The service was very typical of the Strip -- very attentive and a team of staff as opposed to one specific waiter.

By far, one of my favorite dining options and a rare remnant of the old school Vegas.",1
trn_6794,I didn't visit the regular Park I just visited the dog park they have a small one and a large dog park.  shade trees and canopies for shade. 7 benches and 3 drinking fountains. Parking is very close it is to the right side of the whole park and covered shade parking,1
trn_6795,"I've been here twice to meet a friend for dinner.  It has an all-you-can-eat option, which is nice.  I'm always a little skeptical of Asian restaurants who don't have Asians working, especially when the sushi chef is not Japanese.  I'm also skeptical when there are no other Asian customers except for me.  Bad sign.  Fish is not very fresh.  Service is friendly and prompt, but not attentive (had to ask for napkins and missing sushi items)...except drink refills-my cup was almost always full without asking.

To satisfy a sushi craving when you're in the area, it's not a terrible place to stop...but next time I will suggest a different place to meet my friend for our sushi fix!",-1
trn_6796,"The mint lemonade was good enough, but add everything else in and you get some seriously good food experience. I'd say the lunch plate with a little of everything is a good start. From there, you can pick your favorites. You can also use this place as a bakery for an extra added bonus. Quite affordable for what you get. 

The feel of the place is casual. It operates as a cafe for dining in. I haven't been here and not been able to get a seat.Not much to look at, but it does have some bakery goods for the enhanced smell. 

While you're at it, you can visit Amber Unicorn Used books next door. It makes a great lunch stop. Books and Mediterranean food are a great combination.",1
trn_6797,"My 2 teenage daughters and I treated ourselves to a nice dinner at Roy's during our stay at the resort.  I wouldn't say that it was a bad meal, but definitely not worth the high price tag for what we got.  We decided to share 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes and a dessert, so we could get a taste of several things.  Our bill was $150, and we only had water to drink.  Here's what we ordered...

Appetizer sampler canoe for 3 - one sample per person of 5 different appetizers.  each item was pretty good, and presentation was beautiful...but I'm not an Iron Chef judge, so I'd rather have a little more quantity for the high price.

Kalbi Spring Rolls - fried spring rolls with a Korean chojang sauce (Korean red pepper paste).  definitely not worth ordering again.

Hibachi Salmon - 6 oz. salmon cooked perfectly w/ literally a little triangle of rice on the side.  

Hawaii Short Ribs - 6 oz. short ribs were melt in your mouth tender, and very flavorful.

Warm Chocolate Souffle - ordered when we sat down to allow for 20 minute preparation.  our favorite part of the meal!

In short, we enjoyed our dinner, ambiance and location on the resort property...but I just wish they would give a little bigger portion to their dishes for the prices they charge.  I don't think we'd return on our next visit.",0
trn_6798,"So going out for dim sum has slowly dwindled from my diet, there used to be a time when I'd be going weekly with the fam jam. What better way to break that streak than to check out T.Pot China Bistro? All my buddies in town along with my sis were raving about how good T.Pot was, which made it pretty surprising how bad their Urbanspoon rating is. Who knew the 'spoon could be wrong?!! Guess there's always a first for everything. I can only give my two cents on the dim sum but based on my visit, this place is legit. All their dim sum dishes are fresh and made to order. It even had me reminiscing about HK dim sum.

Located in Country Hills, this place is inconveniently out of the way but it's worth the drive. The strip mall area is packed with several other Asian restaurants and a T&T Supermarket. We were able to get VIP parking and did not have to wait long to be seated. We came on a Saturday but way past the brunch/lunch rush, so there was no problem finding a table.

The menu is straight forward - tick off what you want and flag down a waiter/waitress. Then wait for the goodies to come.

-Siu mai (#14) ($5.75) - siu mai came in a fancy, wooden box. A staple item that we always order and it consisted of a mixture of pork and shrimp. Yum.
- Loh mai fun (#29) ($6.50) - preserved meat with sticky rice. A good filler and while it didn't have a lot of meat in it, it was tasty.
- Beef and cilantro cheong fun (#23) ($5.75) - we asked for the soya sauce on the side so that my sis could eat it. Otherwise, these rice crepes are normally drenched in a pool of sauce. They were pretty good.
- Har gow (#11) ($5.75) - the har gow (shrimp dumplings) were nice and plump. Another staple order that we enjoyed.
- Pan fried dumplings (#13) ($6.50) - the pan fried dumplings were delectable. Juicy pork in the inside, good amount of filling and the dumplings had a nice texture/light crisp to them.
- Loh bak go (#39) ($5.75) - good, not too greasy but the fried turnip cakes could have been crispier.
- Thai style vegetables (#80) ($7.95) - we wanted some vegetables to eat/to combat all the meat and grease, so we decided to order their ""Thai"" style vegetables. That's in quotations because I have no clue how these are even slightly associated to Thai food. These were basically stir fried vegetables, not a hint of spice or flavours that you'd expect. Definitely pass on this.
- BBQ pork bun with butter and sugar (#9) ($5.75) - these were sooooooooooooo good. Piping hot, heavenly clouds of pillowy BBQ pork bun goodness. 100% order these, your taste buds can thank me later.

T.Pot is a great spot to grab some tasty dim sum in Calgary. I will be back to try more of their dishes and of course, for their delicious buns. Bun me up!",1

The service was great and the severs were all friendly, but the overall food quality and price was not worth it. Way too expensive for the kind of food they serve.

We spent $170 for 5 people. We ordered takoyaki, bbq squid, and calamari for starters. Then we ordered dynamite roll, California roll,a specialty roll, 3 bentos, and yakisoba. None of which were that good - some dishes were too salty/oily and some didn't seem to be seasoned at all.

I ordered the diablo chicken in a cheese quesadilla and the red jade chicken in a burrito.  I chose to go with the jerk fried rice and refried beans.  

So, the food came and looked pretty good, and a lot for the price.  But it just didnt taste all that great.  The red jade chicken was just the meat wrapped in a tortilla.  Nothing else in the ""burrito"".  The meat was all questionable... when I order chicken I like to see whole pieces of white meat, not grey/clear meat covered in batter.  The diablo chicken was kind of odd with the cheese.  The only thing that tasted fantastic was the snickerdoodle that came with the meal.

trn_6824,"2 stars because the service is too casual for a upscale restaurant and the food is not outstanding for the price. 

i mean to say the servers are not very dignified or well trained. in spite of there poor service i tipped them very well because i am a dignified customer.
Restaurant is clean.
The girls at the front are very helpful.
Nothing much to write about the ambience as nothing is quite exceptional other than beautiful chandeliers all over the places.
Server started to called me buddy, as if we are neighbors. that behavior belongs to smaller restaurants.
I accept i did not order my prime rib right, but the correction made by the server is not professional enough. It's like pointing me out as if i dont know nothing about eating steak.
Food is dropped on our table as if the other side of the restaurant is caught on fire. There is no gentle placement of the food on the table. Again they behave very casually. They should remember we pay for the ambience and service ethics too.
We are party of three people and the table we sat at is quite big. Servers lack minimum common sense to bring in individual sauce cups instead they just left large sauce containers in the middle and we struggled to stretch across the table to dip meat.
I have eaten at so many upscale restaurants so can easily differentiate .

we ordered 3 entrees , i ate Prime Rib and i will review about what i ate.

30% of the prime rib is filled with Fat. i like it but just saying.
Beginning 10 bites are superb and then after chewy part starts. seriously prime rib suddenly turns into a chewing gum.  Not sure why the same experience did not last until the end.
meat dipping sauces (4 different kinds) are so good, i recommend trying them all and stick with what you like the most. I personally liked Peppercorn , Wine based, garlic based sauce. 
Huge Prime Rib portion, i ate 70% and packed 30% for my puppies.
Overall food experience is better than service. 


If you have money, Go ahead give it a try. 
If you experienced fine dining earlier then think before you pick this place. You may not experience similar hospitality .
Try it if you never experienced fine dining earlier , it will help you for comparision purpose.

Thanks for reading my review.",0
trn_6825,"We tried Franciso's Cantina on a recent Friday night. It's not a large space and it was only about 50% full. The restrooms are actually in a hallway out the backdoor and are shared by the restaurants/bars on either side. The space was clean although we did notice some cleaning supplies hanging out on some high-shelves that looked like someone forgot to put them away.

We were seated immediately and a server came by to bring us menus and take our drink orders. It's not a huge menu, but has most of the traditional Tex-Mex items we expect. Our server brought chips and salsa and took our food order. The salsa was fresh and light. The chips were dense and crunchy. There were noticeably fewer chips than at many Mexican restaurants, but still plenty to satisfy.

For dinner we had the tamales and the Carne Asada. The Carne Asada had great flavors. The meat was a little tough to bite through. Beans and rice were all fine. Lettuce, pico, and guacamole were all fresh. The tamales had a delicious sauce and didn't suffer from too much masa. The portion sizes again seemed a mite small by American standards but considering the reasonable prices I have no complaints.

It did take an unusually long time for our server to bring our bill. Especially since she came by and said ""I'll bring you your check."", but then it took quite awhile after that to actually get it.

All in all, I would not hesitate to return if someone wanted to eat here or I happened to be walking by. I wouldn't make a specific effort to back though either. The food was tasty, the portions were small, the prices were reasonable, the service was mixed.",0

The rooms are great and quite large. The front desk star very helpful. The only bad thing is they have valet parking only. I could go on a rant about how much I hate valet parking (you would too if you once had to wait 45 min for your car).  Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1
trn_6827,"Best dental experience EVER! 

Had my teeth cleaned by Dr. RJ before but this is my first time at his very own office. I really appreciated that his staff emailed new patient paper so I didn't have to waste time during my appointment.

The office is brand new and squeaky clean. When I arrived, the staff greeted me warmly. I liked the fact that they had TVs inside the cleaning stations, so I got to watch an episode of The Office while I got X-rays.  

Cleaning process went smooth. And guess what?! Your girl had no cavities. 

Highly recommend Desert Inn Smiles!",1
trn_6828,"I attended an after work event here a few days ago.  It was my first time visiting so I was pretty excited since they were on my list to try.  The appetizers included mac n cheese, hummus, meat and cheese, potato croquettes, bruschetta and a few other apps that were simply not memorable. I did enjoy the blueberry peach mule, it was flavorful and light.  Although I wasn't impressed on this visit, I do plan to return to try brunch .",0
trn_6829,Service was not good tonight even tho it was slow the waitress was 10xtimes slow. Menu has changed the wings were over cooked and I'm not impressed with the new french fries they are salty as hell!,-1
trn_6830,"This place is a real hidden gem! 

I came here for lunch the other day and it's nearby my office and was really happy to have been introduced to this spot. 

Similar to a Panera, you order your meal and pay at the front and then your food is brought out to you, but there are a lot more choices of food to choose from. At first glance the choices are your usual lunch staples; sandwiches, salads, soups but they also have a nice variety of pastas and other entrees like ribs and fish and chips. They also have a large breakfast menu. There seems to be something for everyone with a focus on freshness and healthy choices. 

I tried the warm Mediterranean salad and my friend had the chicken pesto pasta. The portion sizes were more than generous, I was full for hours after the salad and my friend took home some leftovers of her pasta. They also have a salad bar for a make-your-own salad with tons of ingredients ranging from the usual greens to more interesting ingredients like beans and chocolate chips. 

The prices are really reasonable with everything being under $15, even the ribs and seafood entrees are under $15. For the area it's really good, I end up spending close to $20 every time I go to Panera so this is a better choice economically, the freshness and quality of the food is definitely also comparable, while the variety surpasses it in my opinion. 

The service was really good, again, it's similar to a Panera so don't expect full table service but the server/cashier was really sweet and enthusiastic. The table next to us had an issue with their food and they dealt with it really well, the chef even came out to talk with the difficult customer. 

Overall an above average place for lunch in the area. The food is fresh and the service is good. I'm looking forward to trying some other menu items!",1
trn_6831,"I ate at the location in Independence. It was a Wednesday night and the place was full, with a waitlist. Grabbed a seat at the long bar that runs almost diagonally through the strip mall space. Good energy. Interesting, if strange decor. Not enough TV's (the part of the bar I ate at you couldn't really see the monitor. I had the Korean roast pork sandwich and instead of fries I ordered the tomato soup (very good - sent back to come out hot - with basil. Hearty.). Korean pork was fantastic. This place would get 4 stars if it offered more of the creations as half-portions. The portions are ""Man vs. Food"" size and I get it, it's sort of their claim to fame if you will - but a full size sandwich has to have 2000 calories and 75 grams of fat. A belly buster. No one should come here expecting the tilt to be lighter, healthier fare, but at the same time if you're dining alone, which I was, coming to Ohio for business, you will likely leave a bunch of the sandwich over. Overall I enjoyed it and would come back - with a friend.",0

I came in looking for something very specific that they didn't happen to have at this time, but they were able to direct me to something similar. 

I had read reviews about their fish and, even though I hadn't come in to buy fish, they took time to explain to me what they get in and what the differences are and what makes their quality so special.

I will definitely be back soon!",1

trn_6837,"Service was great and there is a big selection of food.  There was no wait on a weekday late morning.  Based on others reviews I wanted some sort of eggs Benedict. They had about 4 to choose from and I settled on the smoked salmon Benedict.  A few things I love about this place: 1) you can choose 1, 2 or 3 eggs!  Depending on how hungry you are, you get to choose the size!  2) the plate came with a wide variety of fruit! Apple, Orange, pineapple, kiwi, banana, a strawberry, and cantaloupe. Keep this in mind when you pick how many eggs. 3) there's milk at the table for your coffee.  In the US, that rarely is the case. 4) side of potatoes is also good. 5) again, great service and quick turnaround.  I might come here everyday for breakfast while I am in town.",1

trn_6840,"The reason Essence of Life gets 5 stars is not because it's posh, lush, or has every single item I could ever need (altho I haven't checked that yet).  It's because it's prices are SO FREAKIN GOOD!

I feel like an idiot for spending so much at the Big Carrot, Whole Foods, and Loblaws when I could just come here and get all my house and personal products here.  My girlfriend told me that the Diva cup is $10 cheaper than elsewhere!  My Gioavanni shampoo is $6.99 instead of $9.99.  All the products we use are significantly cheaper here.  How do they do that?

If Honest Ed's could own an organic shop, this would be the place (altho, without the huge, sprawled out chaos).",1
trn_6841,By far one of the best meals I have ever had. My husband and I went with my brother and a friend for our 1 year Anniversary.  It was by far the best choice we could have picked.

trn_6843,"I wasn't expecting a very good show but i thought it would be fun so I went. I was very surprised how funny the show was. I couldn't stop laughing. They take actual volunteers form the audience. There isn't any nudity in the show, so don't be scared to go up. They keep the people up there that are easier to hypnotize. It is a more vulgar show but if that doesn't bother you. i would highly recomend it.",1
trn_6844,"I came right when they opened at 11am. There was 2 people already in line in front of me. The sweetest lady ever greeted me and asked if I came in from the news (I guess they had a segment earlier this morning). I explained I work close by and had been wanting to try the place out. I ordered my food, which took way too long for my liking. I could definitely tell Ms.Dee normally doesn't do the ordering/ringing up. Then sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait for my food. 45 minutes later I receive my food, and they are missing 1 item... so I wait some more. At last, my order is ready! Then I go to pay after I get my food (which is the strangest thing) they would of let me walk out if I hadn't mentioned I never paid yet. Great food, great people, but they need a lot more help in the back. 1 person to cook and 1 person to take orders obviously isn't cutting it. The people ahead of me actually walked out without getting their food. I mean a 45 minute wait when I was the 3rd person in line for a baked potato seems a little strange to me.",0
trn_6845,"Second time here. This time for brunch. The service was ok. We waited a while even when we were seated. Only 5 of us. The air con was not working correctly so nothing like eating while sweating. We had to wipe the baby down with a cold wet towel to keep him happy. 
I had the chicken sandwich   Elevated it with an egg and bacon. Only way to fly.  The flavors were ok.  The monkey bread was basic. The overwhelming Feeling at the table was that it needed more caramel sauce. We ordered two and both were lackluster.  
The place was busy for a Sunday brunch. Just so many other option out there if this is the service and quality.  Flavors were eh.",0
trn_6846,I thought that the pizza was very good and I really love the atmosphere of the market. I will be a long time customer here.,1
trn_6847,"Went here on a Sunday morning around 11am. Had a feeling the wait might be long considering the time. Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad, but then saw a mass of people outside, then a mass of people inside. Uh oh...its got to be a 45 minute wait and I'm starving, so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand. ""It will be about 10-15 minutes"" she said. Wow!

And it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.

Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.

Overall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free. My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent, but the eggs benedict weren't all that this time so I'll try another meal next time I'm back.",1
trn_6848,"This place is great! I've visited twice now and have enjoyed the atmosphere and food each time. Of course, order the fajitas...I've had the vegetable fajitas, shrimp fajitas, and chicken fajitas. The shrimp fajitas were definitely the best. They're cooked perfectly and the caramelized onions on the skillet are amazing. The wait time can get pretty long if you go around the 5PM hour on a friday or weekends...but I would say it's work the wait.",1

Unfortunately as many reviewers have commented, the food was sub par.  Even to the fact that the food is served in cheap plastic plates and silverware.   I wasn't expecting fine dining but their offerings were something that I could make myself at home (I could have done it better).  
Our entire party was disappointed in this and would make it really hard to return.  It's ashame because I think that they have a lot to offer.",-1

The bar has very unique choices of beer that you can't find in most other places.  The owners are always there and are very nice people.

Loved the original lights, one can call them chandeliers made of pipes and the funky bar stools. 

The service was super friendly and fast, expected as we were some of the very few customers. Ordered the signature poutine with smashed potatoes and of course the tomato salad. Frankly the poutine was a little bit underwhelming. The salad was nice, the mint was an original addition to it. 

What truly won my heart is the beer selection, solid list of local craft brews. The bar has been also well provisioned with quality liquors to keep you warm for the cold months to come. No doubt I will be coming back soon.",1

As for the service, they were very busy for a Friday night.  But with so many tables, my wife, 2-year-old son and I were seated within 10 minutes of check-in.  The hostesses were very friendly and even talked to my son.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us regularly.  However, other waitresses did seem frazzled and lost.  We had one stop by our table to ask to see the kids' menu.
Our appetizer (chips and salsa) came out quickly with very fresh chips.  Shortly after the chips were gone, our food arrived and was very good.  My only complaint is my steak (ordered medium-rare) was slightly overdone but not to the point requiring it to be sent back.
Overall, it was a great experience and we'll return soon.  Now they need to bring back the fried mac 'n cheese  and cherry limeade slushes.",1

Specials:
- Happy Hour; Mon - Thurs, 5PM - 7PM, $6 small bites and $6 drinks (wine, draft beer, and well drinks)
- Half Off Wine Bottles; ALL DAY Thurs!

I came here with one of my girlfriends on a Thursday for Happy Hour. We sat at the bar and shared a bottle of Davis Bynum Chardonnay (since all bottles were half off!) My friend ordered the wood roasted eggplant spread and I ordered the cheese and salami board. She didn't care for her eggplant spread but I love charcuterie and thought this board was well worth the $6! A few meat selections, 2 slices of cheese, bread, and an apricot or peach like chutney/jelly. All of it was delicious and paired perfectly with the Chardonnay. 

The bartenders were nice and attentive - no complaints there!

trn_6871,"Green is really excellent food in many respects. Seriously good food.

But I have one bone to pick with the menu (is that a bad phrase to use for a vegetarian restaurant?): it needs more selections that truly celebrate the vegetable. Almost everything available is mock beef, fake chicken and faux pork. That's fine, I guess, especially for recent vegetarian meat-eaters who are missing some of the old textures and flavors. But for long-time veggies - and even for carnivores like me looking for variety - the menu could stand to have a few more dishes celebrating beans and mushrooms and soy and all the other incredible flora that are just fine being themselves and not pretending to be flesh.

It's better that way - and, let's face it, that veggie burger is never going to taste as good as the real burger if that's what you are really after.",0

Ordered the ""thunder thighs"" - which sounded like buffalo wings made w chicken thighs, but ended up w regular wings. Not sure if we got the wrong order or if they are just called thighs when they are wings. Either way I was disappointed, but the wings were pretty decent after I got over the sadness.

At our table we had a chicken sandwich, a sausage and pepper hoagie, and a pork chop. The chicken was reported as good (wasn't mine), the pork was Ok but not out of this world, and the sausage was messy but good - had marinara sauce on it which was unexpected. The mac and cheese was a little greasy but pretty good.

As for the ""biker bar"" label.. I saw about 2 bikers and the rest of the crowd was regular peeps. The girls wear skimpy outfits so its not a family place for sure.

trn_6876,"This is my favorite quick-burrito place I've ever been to--anywhere in the world.  Service is quick and simple.  You get in line, you tell them item-by-item what you want, and they make your burrito.

Why do I like this place, and what makes it stand out from others?

The selection of items to put on your burritos is perfect: they offer three kinds of beans (many places offer only 1 or 2), the different kinds of meat are all good, their salsa is very good, and they offer both guacamole and cilantro, both of which are always fresh.  Also, I might add that this place offers a wide variety of salsas, ranging from mild to very friggin' hot.  They also offer tomatillo salsa (my fav.), something lacking from most fast-food burrito places.

There are a few other options (tacos, salads, side of chips, etc.) but basically this is a burrito joint: simple and to the point.

The people working behind the counter are incredibly nice and will recognize you if you are a regular customer, even though it's a busy place.  The atmosphere is nice--it tends to be clean, especially for this sort of establishment, and there is always good salsa music playing.  There's a nice wall mural to add to the character too.

In short, you can't go wrong with this place.  People who prefer Chipotle simply have bad taste.",1

My husband is very picky.....he was very satisfied! Nice old school family atmosphere that you don't find anymore. I highly recommend them for any auto work you need.

The butterfish was not still semi-frozen in the middle, which was a nice! We also ordered the seafood curry to split. I liked the salmon in it, but really disliked the vast amounts of imitation crabmeat that was in there. I'd go there again, if I'm in the area and craving sushi, but I wouldn't go out of my way.

trn_6890,"I am pretty much obsessed with pot pie, so I was excited to find this place. The food was great. The chicken pot pie was better than I hoped for! Reasonably priced, a little small (only because it was so good, I wanted like 10 more ), but big on flavor. I was worried it would be dry, but there was a perfect proportion of pastry to meat to veggies to gravy. My kids had chicken pot pies, mac & cheese, fruit and lemonade, and they happily devoured it all.

The man taking our order (assuming he is an owner) asked my daughter about herself and she was excited to tell him it was her birthday. When the food was ready, he surprised us with a birthday dessert for her. He seriously has no idea how much I appreciated that - it made my daughter feel SO special! She is such a sweet girl and it made her day to have a stranger do something thoughtful for her. He was also asking me how he could make the store more kid friendly, and seemed to genuinely care about the overall enjoyment of his customers. We couldn't be happier to find delicious, reasonably-priced, homemade food, along with wonderful customer service. We will definitely be back!",1
trn_6891,Been over a week and no calls from Big O to fix this problem! I've posted a review everywhere I can and all I get is the standard reply.! I've emailed and called still no response from a human! Next step a call to the BBB!,-1
trn_6892,"I tried this restaurant for Arizona Restaurant Week. I really like this restaurant. The atmosphere is awesome, small, nice decor, nice music, and great customer service. Fuego Tacos has a great bar that offers an array of drinks, the food is superb. 

The offer for Restaurant Week was a three course meal with a glass of sangria. My husband and I loved our meal. We started with the taco salad, made with fresh ingredients and extremely flavorful. The chipotle dressing was the perfect amount of heat, we chose to have the salad made with the Pernil Asado. A perfect choice, heavenly! 
For the main course I had the Pernil Asado tacos. I LOVE this meat, so tender and has outstanding flavor. My husband had the Barbacoa tacos and we were not as impressed with this particular meat choice.
 The dessert was churros with ancho fudge sauce. I was not at all impressed with this dessert. The fudge sauce lacked ancho chile flavor, which was a complete disappointment. I would have preferred some heat.

Overall, I loved the restaurant, the food and the customer service.  I will definitely go back again.",1
trn_6893,"My experience was great not perfect. This experience was good too me but not worth the money. Service was very friendly but slow. Not sure what going on in the kitchen but when the food came out it was good cooked perfect. ... wow just thinking about the food it went up from 3 stars to 4.
I started out with Ceviche, really good perfect. I had to fight the other guys to quit stealing a taste :) ... I ordered the ribeye and added the Oscar which was hollandaise sauce with crab and asparagus and a side order or wild mushrooms. The guys ordered Ribeye, New York and a Kansas City Strip they rated the steaks all  #4. The total bill with tip came out to be about $325. It was good but dam $325 ... i could see that money going back into my photography fund. If you get a chance go here ... but don't bring the guys ... bring your wife or g/f.",1

trn_6895,"I wanted to like this place after reading reviews but I was severely let down. It took almost ten minutes to be greeted by our waiter, who did not come over until I had to wave him down. Chips and cheese came and the cheese was thin and cold. Enchiladas came cold and without the steak as advertised. Had to wave for the waiter again to bring the steak which came cold to no surprise. A gray piece of shoe leather in which I wish didn't come at all. Never again. Worst experience at a restaurant in years.",-1
trn_6896,I was fortunate to see the progression of Smash Iron. I am happy to say that this is the place most people would not imagine I would be.

I hope that everyone meets a Carlo and will transformed  to a life worth living!!!,1
trn_6897,"Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own.

trn_6898,We had a very bad experience with our recent visit to the restaurant. 1st of all there is no sign in directing us where we should go to find the restaurant in Caesars palace - it literally took us more than 30 mins to find the restaurant. The ambiance was nice. Food is average and definitely not 5 stars quality. Our martini's came out room temperature despite we asked that to be very cold (which it supposed to be).  At the end when the bill came we all chipped in our credit cards and the waitress bought our card back and all individual card amount was much more than the original bill - there were 3 baileys and one cheesecake added to the bill ($125).  We questioned the bill and waited for close to an hour for them to fix it. They gave us a break on our drinks. Very very bad experience- definitely ruin mr chows reputation!,-1
trn_6899,Great hotel!  Though I might be biased because they upgraded my standard room to a suite.  Nice and spacious.,1
trn_6900,"Beautiful hotel and nice rooms... but you are also paying through your nose for it (therefore, not the 5th star).   I stayed there for both personal vacation as well as business conventions - and always liked the place.   The Grand Canal was great and the plaza there was fantastic.   A must if you are to go to Las Vegas...",1
trn_6901,"We are first time home buyers and a bit overwhelmed with all the requirements and procedures.  Our agent gave us a list of home inspectors and a few mins of research showed me Home Pride Inspections was the clear winner.  Specifically, Charles Ming was the man I wanted for our inspection.  Needless to say I was not disappointed.  Charles was able to get us scheduled quickly to meet our timeline.  He was truly a big help to us in understanding the condition of the property we are purchasing.  He took the time to answer all my questions (even the non relevant ones) with professionalism and a smile.  It's comforting to know we have someone on our team in all of this.

A few days later we scheduled Charles to come back for the re-inspection.  Again, Charles was very professional in his approach and continued to answer all my questions with patience.  Unfortunately, as the re-inspection was underway, the seller's agent called to inform us we were not scheduled to be on the property and that if we didn't vacate immediately the police would be called.  Whoa! Hold on a sec... no need to make threats to Charles while he is performing his contracted job.  A lesser man would have lost his cool but not Charles.  We quickly complied with the request and vacated the property.  Again... THANK you Charles for your patience and understanding.  The situation could have got out of control but he maintained a professional attitude.

If you are in need of a home inspection then look no further than Home Pride Inspections.  They are a solid outfit, hire veterans, and even give discounts to vets.  Don;t forget to ask for Charles Ming.  He's definitely the one you want on your team.",1
trn_6902,"To start, its a beautiful venue. Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy. 

We had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.

Fast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.

We called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as ""assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres"" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.

When we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. 

Needless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.

Please be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous. The venue itself it nice, and private, but no way was I going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings.",-1

trn_6904,"Indeed, I am a fan!!!  Ever since I had an acai bowl near Redondo Beach, I've been craving one.  I've made it but sometimes it's easier to just buy it and now, I can get it at Nekter Juice Bar.  It is sooooo good and sooo yummy and sooo full of good stuff, nutritious and is satisfying as well...  Nekter has a vast menu of juices and smoothies, pre packed juice cleanse and raw food choices.  I heart this place and will definitely, definitely be back!!!",1
trn_6905,"Having been here several times, I can say I fully agree with a previous reviewer who said the two optometrists at this location are excellent, but the staff and overall atmosphere are below par. While the optometrists were helpful and friendly, I have found the staff to be defensive and rude. 

On one occasion, I requested an appointment for a specific reason but was told the person I needed to see was on holidays for two weeks. Since I needed the issue taken care of as quickly as possible, I said unfortunately, I'd have to research other options. I was then told I could come in the next day to see someone. I was extremely confused and asked for clarification on why I was now able to make my appointment. I found the staff member very short with me and I ended up going elsewhere (to Bloor Optical, which was also more affordable.)",-1
trn_6906,"It's taken me waaay to long to get to this review but I want everyone to know how incredibly impressed I was with Natalie and Elizabeth. To start, their website was easy to navigate, the pricing was clear and beyond fair for the outcome. Booking was easy and they kept in contact throughout the entire process. The day of my wedding they showed up at the precise time (punctuality is a must and they exceed that). They exude professionalism. I told them my ideas and showed them photos of what I liked. I had one original idea for my hair and they explained how a different hairstyle would work better for my thinner finer hair and I have to say they knew exactly what they were talking about. They customized my makeup that worked best with my tone and even completely removed how incredibly sunburned I got the day of my wedding. (I know not a solid move of a bride)! When they were done and I was able to see what they had created I was beyond floored and even tried not to cry because they had completely hit the mark of my anticipation of how I wanted to look on my wedding day. 

I would recommend Glammed Up to anyone. If I ever find myself in Vegas in need of hair and makeup I am going to call them. I wish I lived closer and they could do my hair and makeup daily cause I'd love to look like that daily. 

Thank you so much for making me feel incredibly beautiful and literally taking my husbands breath away. You both were the absolute best. Exceeded all of my expectations.",1

trn_6908,"I was recently meeting someone who didn't know the neighbourhood too well around Yonge and St Clair, and I suggested Scallywags, simply because you can't miss it. It's a yellow, three-storey monster (rooftop patio included) with a dozen or so international flags hanging off its façade. I didn't get the full appreciation of Scallywags' capacity at the time, since it was early on a weekday evening, and the place was pretty dead.

They have a respectable, if not too exotic, selection of good beers on tap, and seem to strike the balance between sports bar and pub. Their website even lists upcoming international sports broadcasts (mostly soccer), so you can know when's best to go (or stay away, depending on your tastes).",1

The customer service is overall perfect. The staff is so friendly and very fast. However, I don't give it 5 stars because that fat f**k ""dylan"" gave me attitude over his very watered frapp. But luckily Ariana saved it and she made it so perfect I only trust her now. Moral is f**k Dylan.",1

trn_6916,"I read that Bellagio had one of the better buffets in Vegas so I decided to give it a try for lunch.  The line wasn't long at 11am so I decided to play a few slots and use the restroom.  When I returned 30 minutes later, the line was long and winding!  Ugh.

I got a seat close to the buffet itself.  I was disappointed though.  I didn't see anything spectacular about this buffet and the price was a bit high.  It seemed like a regular Vegas buffet to me.  Plus the drink service was very slow.  I had already finished my first plate by the time my drink arrived.  Good luck trying to ask for refills.  Might as well bring in a bottle of water.  Although, I do admit that their dessert counter was one of the best ones I've seen.  

I'd like to try it again but for dinner.  Perhaps their food is better then.

Be sure to pick up a pear from the fruit basket.  I thought it was a decorative item but it was actually a real pear.  And it was the best pear I've ever had!  :)",0
trn_6917,"4 stars for the novel Topgolf experience, 5 stars for the awesome service we received for a unique/slightly awkward situation!

If your only experience with golfing is mini-golf.....have no fear! I had NEVER so much as held a proper golf club before and I had an awesome time here acquiring a new skill (the fact that drinks are served here didn't hurt, either!)

I should say...you DO have to get over the inevitable crowd of wandering eyes from neighboring booths as you try to perfect your clearly-my-first-time-golfing swing. Once you get over the stage fright and you actually hit a couple balls, you realize why so many people enjoy golf :) 

My group of 5 were having a great time when one of the waitresses came to clear our table of drinks and spilled her entire tray onto the floor, getting shards of glass all over our sandals and flip flops. It was cleaned up very efficiently, but not before we realized my boyfriend had a small cut on his ankle from the glass. Not a huge deal, but it was definitely alarming to see blood, and we were running out of playing time!

Because of this debacle, we had to rush through the last few minutes of our time to complete our second game. Luckily, we were later approached by management; they offered to refund all of our payments made towards playing time and memberships, AND offered us a round of drinks at the bar on the house. 

5 thumbs up for going above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. I would definitely return to Topgolf, if I ever happen to be near one in the future!",1
trn_6918,I took out the fried kibbeh and steak hummus and both were excellent.  My in-laws are Lebanese and Naya's food was just as great.  My wife said the mezza combo was the best she's had from a restaurant.  We'll be back to eat-in real soon.,1
trn_6919,El Hefe's Tempe is in my opinion as well as my buddies the best bar in Tempe!  Great atmosphere and staff specifically Alexis Cherry (yes her real name). Highly recommend stopping in and I'm enjoying the SIGHTS as well as the great food and atmosphere!,1
trn_6920,"OK, I'm very hesitant to write a negative review about a reportedly Catholic business. Superstitions and bad karma and all that (although my husband would say Catholics don't believe in karma....ok, so maybe the Golden Rule?). But I feel my experience needs to be shared to possibly help other grieving families during a very emotional and stressful time.

I contacted them about a final resting place for my husband's ashes. I really should say I attempted to contact them, as I was instructed to leave a voice mail for Julie. More than 3 days went by and Julie never returned my call, so I called again and asked to speak with Julie. She quoted me some prices starting at $3,900.00 for 2 people. We agreed to set an appointment for exactly 2 weeks later at 11am, so I could view their offerings for placement of cremated remains.

I arrived a few minutes early and checked in, signing their register. The girl at the desk asked if I was sure I had an appointment with Julie. I said yes, I made it 2 weeks prior and wrote down her name. After a few minutes of waiting, Julie came out to the lobby and acted like she had never spoken to me, had absolutely no recollection of our conversation. Come on, this isn't my first rodeo, I always write down the specifics (name, date, time) of random appointments, so you can bet I definitely captured that information for something as important as a final resting place for my husband. She said she was with another family and it would be at least 30-45 minutes until she could see me. I very politely told her that was unacceptable, as I had made an appointment with her and expected that appointment to be honored to the best of their ability. She said she would try to find one of her colleagues who could meet with us. She returned to the lobby and again quoted the 30 minute time frame, but finally, admitted she made an error and failed to write down our appointment time.

Finally, after about another 10 minutes, she returned to the lobby and said another man would be able to meet with us. Fabulous. So, he came out, got us settled in a room and started in on his whole spiel. In all honesty, we should have just left at this point, as he tried to turn it into a long-drawn out process, perhaps to wear me down and get me to agree to something much more expensive.

We finally got in the car to tour the grounds and see available options. Julie initially quoted a price of $3,900.00 for space for 2 people (planning ahead for my final resting place too). This man showed ""property"" in the $6,000.00 - $10,000.00 range. I stated Julie said $3,900.00 was where they started for 2 spaces. He said that was wrong, $3,900.00 is just for 1 person. I told him with all due respect, I am now a widowed stay-at-home mother with a young son to raise, my first priority is making sure my son is taken care of, not spending the equivalent of a small used car for our final resting place, so cut the sales pitch and show me what's in my budget.

While I understand they are a business and obviously operating on a for-profit basis, I do not appreciate their sales tactics. He repeatedly told me to pray about my decision and he would follow up with me in a few days. Guess what, I prayed about it and God told me to go with another (still Catholic) cemetery that was over $3,000.00 less for a comparable niche for 2 people. Imagine the care I can provide for my son and the donation I can make to help others in need with the more than $3,000.00 price difference.",-1
trn_6921,"Tyler is a cool barber that actually listens to his clients. His line-up skills are top class and he doesn't upsell his cuts. My 10 year old and I got a cut for $25 total and our cuts were better than another place that charged us a little more. From what I saw from the other chairs the other barbers are very skilled as well. They actually compete in state and national barber shows. I highly recommend this place over the other Charlotte barber shop I reviewed. Yes it's in the hood, yes the guys here cuss alot but its nothing but Straight talk about real issues and doesn't affect their craft. Trust me! 

Why not 5 stars? I need more time.... If i could I'd give it 4.5 stars now...

I loved these (good taste and quality shrimp)...the sauce was a bit much for my sister...the consistency of a sauce for honey walnut prawns...which is not what she was looking for. I gladly ate most of them!  The garlic noodles, while good, also seemed to be cooked with a LOT of butter, which I wasn't ready for and left a weird, heavy after-taste so we didn't finish those.  We also started with the fresh spring rolls that were delicious and their dipping sauce was good. Wish they kept siracha/other sauces on the table or brought them out right away with the food, but that is just a little thing.  Also ordered the combo rice--awesome! Totally missed we could have added an egg to the top-dang it! Good portion and flavor, and I love that they accompany it with scallion broth and a salad-a great touch.  When I am back in AZ, I will definitely return!",1

The carnivore got she-crab soup which had a very strong crab flavor but not much crab; overall the taste was good. We've decided to go back, try other items on the menu and give it another shot.",0

trn_6929,"I hate to be the black sheep, but I was simply unimpressed with Mancini's. They have a great reputation in Pittsburgh, and after 5 years in this city, it was about time I see what all the fuss is about. Although I will never experience one of their famous Pepperoni Rolls (being a vegetarian has its downfalls), I figured the next best thing was the Spinach & Feta Roll.  It turned out to be a huge letdown. Aside from tasting a bit old and dry, it could have used a lot more filling. The marinara dipping brought it up a notch, but I don't understand why they must charge an extra $0.75 for half a scoop of marinara that clearly came out of a $1 jar. The real killer was the unevenly baked bread. There were corners where it was just RAW DOUGH. Why Mancini's?! I'm really hoping this was a crazy fluke because how can a bakery beloved by all of Pittsburgh be that bad? However, I can be forgiving. The next time I hit up a Mancini's, I'm hoping for redemption.",-1

Food: 
We ordered different variations of ice cream + whipped cream + drizzled sauce.
I ordered chocolate ice cream with whipped cream drizzled in caramel sauce. What I found interesting was that the chocolate ice cream was covered with a thin layer of chocolate. It was delicious!!  Just the right amount of sweets to end the night!

Service:
A friendly young lady took our order and gave us our order. The only thing that she was not able to do was split the bill (due to large crowds coming in after World Cup matches). 

Atmosphere: 
It was warm and cozy- the lighting was dimmed, so that people can enjoy food and talk. Although it was really crowded that day, we still had a good time.

I would visit here again to try other items!",1

The Firecracker Shrimp was outstanding and I really liked the garlic noodles that they came with. I ordered a bowl of Scallion Broth and it was delicious. The salad that came with it was basic but the dressing was very good.

The eggrolls were not the best we've had and we actually didn't finish them. Not bad, just not the best I've had.

My wife said the Pho was just mediocre and the Pho places in Goodyear are better.

I have tried Baklava before, but I didn't care for it that much before. This place makes it just right. Not too sweet, which is how I like most of my pastries. 

My boyfriend was raving about the Shawarma, so we ordered the lamb Shawarma. It was wrapped in pita with veggies and yummy sauces. If you like spicy, definitely get the spicy sauce in your Shawarma! It is just the right amount of spice and tasty.

I can vouch for the quality and taste of their meat, fish and sides.  You get wonderful dishes, large portions, cooked perfectly, according to your instructions.  Not only do they make their meat and fish dishes to excel, but you can't improve on .the flavor or consistency of any of their side dishes, making the veggies sing and dance in your mouth and their desserts take a curtain call!

Stopped in for lunch and was quite surprised. The appearence on the outside makes you think you are going into a hole in the wall. However open the door and its very spacious. 

The menu reminded me of a very popular spot down on Charleston. Especially since they serve chicken wraps with sides of spinach feta pasta or chicken pasta, hmmmm... Have seen those somewhere else.. 

The wrap was good! Tender chicken, loaded with crisp vegetables. The portion size was great, not too big or small. I got the chicken pasta as a side. It had a sweet flavor to it, not too appetizing. My friend got the spinach feta pasta which was a bit salty. 

My lunch with a drink was $12, a little pricey for a sandwich and 1 side and no table service. 

Not a bad place, but didn't taste anything that I would crave later to make me go back.",0
trn_6940,Not a bad selection for all you can eat sushi but I have been to better with others when placing orders with an iPad. Restaurant was busy for lunch and they did bring out our food fast which was an added bonus. Wish they had more tofu options on the menu but it was a great experience.,0
trn_6941,"Homey ambience, authentic comfort food.

I had the pork bone soup, as usual. And Simon had seafood pancake, as usual.

Everything was flavourful and well seasoned. There was parilla powder in the soup, and the pancake (deep fried which was a little odd) had lots of green onions :) 

Water is self serve on the side, parking can be a little tight, but don't let the details deter you, the food is worth it :)",1

trn_6944,"I have continued to eat here after my initial review, and it just keeps getting better.

The wings are AMAZING. However, if you are getting delivery they do not punch holes in the container and steam makes them squishy. I have tried several time changes (for how long they are cooked) and 15 minutes (which is 5 min over how long they normally cook them) is the best time for the wings to still be crisp when they get to your door.

The pastrami is great, the garlic bread is amazing, the delivery drivers are awesome! Their pasta is great. 

Still haven't tried the pizza but it looks good.

Mister G's may be my favorite delivery place in Tempe.",1
trn_6945,"Irean, is magical. From the initial consult through to the touch up, Irean was professional, knowledgeable, caring and took her time to create my perfect brows. I am over the moon happy with the brows she created.

trn_6951,"There's a good reason this place already has a lot of my money...

I moved to Vegas in March of 2012 and brought my '07 Daytona with me. When the electrical system had an issue, I didn't have any Triumph-specific place to take my bike and was forced to do the maintenance myself (which is no easy task considering my lack of mechanical knowledge). 

A few months after doing the maintenance, I decided to research the closest Triumph dealership to Vegas and Freedom Cycle had just opened up a few miles away from home. 

From the first visit to the brand new store, everyone in the shop was extremely friendly and accommodating. I am a huge Triumph fan and like learning all new things that come about. With the staff here being so knowledgable and personal, there's no better place on earth to go and kill a couple of hours talking motorcycles. 

Fast forward to November. When Freedom Cycle received a ""special edition"" Daytona (one of 20 imported to the US), I had to take a look at it. After talking with Craig for a couple of hours, it only made sense to trade in the '07 for the new bike. The sales experience was easy and pain/pressure-free. In talking with Mark (owner) and Craig, I almost forgot I was buying a bike during the process and thought I was talking with buddies I've had for years. 

I wanted a few aesthetic accessories put on the bike and Junior ensured a ridiculously quick turnaround and top notch work. At this point, I have more plans for parts/accessories and have no reservations about bringing it there for every ounce of work that needs to be done. 

I have now become one of those guys who drops into the shop for nothing other than to say hello and see how things are going. When Mark told me he didn't just want me to buy the bike there but he wanted to make me ""a customer for life"", he did that for sure. 

I don't intend on living in Vegas for the rest of my life but I certainly intend on looking at Freedom Cycle first (and only) for my next Triumph motorcycle - because Lord knows there'll be another one some day!",1
trn_6952,"This place is definitely unique. I haven't been here in a few years and I'm glad that I decided to re-visit today. 

The diner itself is different from your ordinary food spots.  It has great lights on the inside and I get that old diner vibe with the staff wearing their uniforms.

The food is great and comes in HUGE proportions.  I ordered breakfast and recieved enough food for the entire day. 

The staff are all extremely good looking which doesn't hurt either! 

Overall it was great :)",1
trn_6953,"Moved to town a couple of days ago and used the Yelp app to look for something to eat. I came across Jefe's Taco Shop and decided to try it out. I tried the Carne Asada street tacos with refried beans/rice in the side and my wife tried the California burrito bowl. I absolutely loved mine and she said hers was ""spectacular"". It's in a gas station so directions threw me off a bit and I drove right past it, but turned around and managed to figure it out. I met Ben and he was super nice guy and very proud of his creations, as well he should be.",1
trn_6954,"As fun as the likes of Hakkasan, Marquee, and XS can be (so many pretty girls!), clubbing has never really been my thing.  However, spots like Level Up?  Now we're talking!  Though, I'll admit I'm not sure why I found it THAT interesting.  it's not like they're super unique, especially in a place like Vegas.  What's more, I can't even blame the sixteen-year-old in me!  Otherwise, I'd be all over the club scene, awkwardly trying to meet girls.  Just like not sixteen-year-old me...ha!

In all seriousness though, Level Up is a pretty decent spot for something more low-key than hitting a club.  Like so many of the ""bar-cade"" spots that are popping up these days, they have a whole variety of games here to keep you entertained - pool tables, Pop-A-Shot, foosball, beer pong, arcade games (giant Pac-Man!), and some bowling lanes/machines.  In true Vegas fashion though, they also have some arcade machines that you can wager money on, video poker, and a whole set-up/production to jazz up a typical blackjack/roulette game.

While we tried our hand at a bunch of the aforementioned games, we were most excited to play some shuffleboard (shit-talking and wagers of shots may or may not have been discussed at length).  Too bad their whole set-up was AWFUL.  The table felt longer than most I've played on, but the bigger issue was with the powdery material they used to cover their board (instead of the typical silicone beads).  I know that sounds petty, but really did make the game a lot less fun.

As far as the drinks go, the pours seemed generous enough, but it's hard to say for certain; since we were expecting to do some shots, we only had a round of beers.  What's more, since my friend paid, I can't even say how their prices compare (though it's Vegas, so ""pricey"" wouldn't be an entirely inaccurate assumption).  

All in all, while I can't say my friends and I had an amazing time, Level Up was far from a terrible way for us to kill some time.  Plus, I'd be remiss not to point that we didn't check out what's probably the highlight of what they have to offer - their VR experience!  While not truly free-roaming (you're still corded and seemingly limited to one room), it's probably the closest you're going to get to a real life zombie apocalypse.  Literally for that reason alone, I would definitely be open to coming back!",0
trn_6955,Ice cream is top notch. For reals. We love the birthday cake and cookie dough. To top it off kids under a certain height get a free cone! The employees are also very nice. It was kinda hard to hear what the orders were. So I suggest standing close to the window to prevent any mix ups.,1

trn_6964,"I had wings from here twice, delivered. First time I ordered the mild with ranch and they came naked. I wasn't sure if they forgot to add the sauce or if that's just what mild is. The second time I ordered garlic-romano with ranch. The wings again came naked, with a tub of garlicky dip on the side -- there was no ranch. Unfortunately the garlicky dip really wasn't very good either so I ate most of them plain. Honestly it's pretty weird for the wings to come plain like that rather than tossed in the sauce. The upside is that the wings themselves are really good, perfectly fried. If the sauce situation were ok, they would be some of the best wings in the city, but as it is it won't be going in my rotation.",-1
trn_6965,"During our last trip to Toronto, our friends decided on Big Daddy's for dinner one evening and we joined them after our trip up the CN Tower. Located close to the Tower, we took a  relatively short walk to regain our bearings after the giant elevator ride and, although I was a little leery going for Cajun food in the middle of Toronto, we were willing to give it a shot. 

We headed down the stairs off King Street and were quickly directed to our party that was already seated in the front corner of the restaurant. According to the menu, we were in the sweet spot of what they call Voodoo Hours where all small plates were $2 off and we capitalized on that by ordering the jalapeño cornbread, Creole flavored mussels and the open faced oyster po boy to share and make up our meal.

The jalapeño cornbread was decent with a small amount of spice although nothing else really stood out about it. The oyster po boy was easily the best of three dishes we had with a nice amount of perfectly fried oysters on top of toasted bread with a little bit of what they call ""Chipotle Tabsaco remoulade"" that came across as a mildly tangy mayo sauce without the expected bold flavors. Very tasty and gave me a taste for fried oysters I won't soon forget. The mussels were the biggest disappointment with overpowering amounts of celery even for a Creole dish. The spice was a bit much and the sauce didn't come together flavor wise even with the mussels cooked in it. I love mussels and this was just a bad showing.

All in all I'm not sure I'd recommend the place to people when visiting town but if you were really hunting for oysters or if you live in town and need a change in pace this wouldn't be a terrible option. More like 2.5 than 3, I'll give it the extra because my fiancée liked the cornbread and the sandwich was interesting.",0

trn_6970,"Ok I know its all hyped up but I really enjoyed my two experiences here and I'll you why....
First independent of the restaurant there is a Sugar bar inside of the Paris casino that's connected to the restaurant (its the back side) you can get all your food served at the bar there. We had happy hour there but no food. Bartender was super friendly and happy hour was buy one get one free of their amazing cocktails. Roughly you pay about 10 bucks a drink with happy hour prices and tip but the drinks are HUGE and i was done done after 1.5 of them. They were delicious and whimsical (Swedish Fish Cherry thing was wow) and the smores martini packs quite a punch!

Moving along to the restaurant...Saturday morning it was packed! However we were sat really quickly....but then we were ignored for 20 min....through no fault of the waitress though they didnt tell her they broke up a large table and had begun seating in her section. She quickly put our order in and the food came out really quick (but i did see other tables wait ions for their food...I guess since they front loaded our wait time we got to have an expedited order)
Food was really good and not expensive. I had a Raspberry creme brulee crepe which was rich but light. Not too heavy (finished the whole thing!) and the raspberry sorbet it was topped off with was the perfect compliment to the warm crepe. We also had chicken tenders and the basket was full!! We got like 6 or 7 pieces and couldn't polish them off. 
Anywho I will definitely be back to the bar and restaurant",1

trn_6972,"We had a friend visiting from out of town a few weekends ago who wanted a good steak and sushi.  We aren't huge sushi fans, though we have eaten at Sushi Rock a few times (and have heard pretty good things about their steaks) so we decided this was a cool, fun place to take someone from out of town.

Wrong-o!  

I made reservations on Open Table and requested to sit upstairs.  I think the vibe is a little cooler and less club-y upstairs, so figure it will be perfect.  We show up and it's so loud that the hostess asks me to repeat the last name at least 4 times.  I eventually give up and spell it (It has 4 letters!! And is not unusual in any way!) and she confirms that we still want upstairs.  Yes, awesome, we do.

Except, little did I know, that they also have a room upstairs that I will call the kinda-looks-like-a-diner-old-people-storage-room that is not contemporary.  It's all beige-y and is playing adult contemporary love jams! Yes, it's streaming totally different music from the rest of the place. It's like we walked into a totally different restaurant.

Anywhere I can order a burger (1/2lb - 2lbs), eat endless fries, take three shots of  Patrón and watch my burger get cooked by a gorgeous woman in basically a thong, is a place worthy to eat at.

Once again they did a thorough, professional job, both with the inspection (done by Isaac), as well as with the treatment. The price was reasonable, far below what friends tell me the ""big name"" exterminating companies have quoted them for LESS actual treatment! (Seriously -- one person said Terminix quoted him $4000!! This guy does not live in a mansion, either!) House Doctor trenched around the entire perimeter of my house, drilled holes in the concrete along the rear patio and interior garage, but first carefully checked if all locations were OK with me for drilling. I was the first appointment of the day, and the technician arrived 15 minutes early, which impressed me very much! I would strongly recommend House Doctor Exterminating: friendly, knowledgeable, service-minded, professional, and thorough... all at far less than what the other guys charge for less treatment/service!

trn_6983,"There's two sides to Station Square.  It's almost like Jekyll and Hyde. During the day it's all sunshine and puppy dogs with families running around to the various restaurants and shops inside the ""mall."". Then when it turns dark the creatures of the night come out to freak nasty at da club! 

There's no denying it's a total tourist trap during the day.  You're definitely not going to get a unique Pittsburgh dinning experience considering all of the restaurants are chains. I'm not gonna lie, I've visited most of them so I can't hate too much.  You've got Bucca's, Joe's Crabshack, Melting Pot...although I do have a soft spot for that place....mmmm choco fondue.

The ""mall"" part is....just....weird.  There's a rando mix of country bumpkin craft stores, a toy store and about a million trillion Steelers sports stores.  I put ""mall"" in quotations because a long long time ago it used to have legit shopping.  Now it's just...a wasteland.  It's one of those places that has SO MUCH potential, but doesn't quite cut it.  I'm sighing right now, van you tell? 

When I think of Station Square, I think of the down and dirty club zone. Of course it's like any normal club areas.  There's not one club that's been there more than a couple years.  A lot of them turn over to the next one.  Different theme, same bump and grind.

I was partial to Matrix, but sadly it closed.  I think I knew it was the end of an era when my shoes starting sticking to the floors!  Now if I go down there I usually go to Buckheads.  It's a pretty casual bar/club that features a rotation of bar band and DJ.  The bands are always a crap shoot.  Sometimes I'm impressed with a rando 80's band, but sometimes a poor attempt at a Train song can make my ears bleed a little! 

One thing you can be assured is t's always a great place to see the Pittsburgh creepers come out to play!  Please keep a look out for Pittsburgh Pete.  You can find him breakin it down in the middle of the dance floor wearing his fashionable home made shirt that reads ""Pittsburgh Pete, stop hatin'.""  You can't get much better than that!",0
trn_6984,"Before we went to see ""Love"" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

And I get my nails done at random places at least 3x a month .. They barely cut my cuticles, basically leaving my dead cuticles! After explaining to the lady several times; even showing her by cutting them myself .. She could not do it. My nails are all oddly shaped & my toe nails were cut way too much.

trn_6988,"I've been to pickle barrel many times. It was my go to chain restaurant (moxies, Kelsey, Casey's...). I feel like that is no longer the case. I was here for dinner with a party of 6.

After we got there it took at least 20 mins for someone to come and take drink orders.  We had enough time to figure out what we were having. We also noticed the tables weren't properly wiped down. When they brought us the drinks one of the glasses was dirty. One of my friends said that one of the components of the dish was cold but fully cooked. Which leads more to believe food is not made to order. 

I decided to go with the lobster grilled cheese. Fortunately the food didn't take long to arrive. As far as grilled cheeses go it hit the mark. They used a whole grain bread (scored some healthy points) and it was crispy just the way I like it. There was a fair amount of cheese although I don't think there is such a thing as too much cheese. My only wish was that they would have added more lobster. I would have gladly paid more for it too. I also felt like not much effort went into assembly.

The grilled cheese came with sweet potatoes fries (I upgraded) and a coleslaw topped with a slice of pickle. The sweet potato fries weren't anything special. It was to soggy for my liking. The coleslaw was pretty good and went well with the sandwich.

I understand, but I felt sorry for a couple who were turned away when she quickly snapped, ""We're closed!""  Maybe need a bit of a refresher on customer service.  I didn't really enjoy my meal 'cause I felt rushed!",0

It was really clogged up.   Matt worked at it from inside, crawling behind our dryer, and from the outside vent.  He was here for 5 hours, working continually, showing us the progress he was making every hour or so. He even cleaned the vent  inside of my dryer!   I don't know anything about dryers and ventilation systems- he could have left after only half the job was done and I wouldn't have known any better.  He stayed until the job was completed and didn't charge any extra for his time.  He cleaned up every bit of lint, too.  From now on, we'll call him every time we need our vent cleaned!  I can't say enough good things about him!",1
trn_6992,"Another day, another new place to try a flat white!  My morning meeting sent me over to Dundas W and I've had Run and Gun on my radar for a while.  This is a very cute neighbourhood spot.  Lots of sunlight, greenery, and muted woods to give that zen like feel... when I walked in, quiet and soothing is what I would call the place.  Everyone here was just sitting still reading or typing quietly away.

Run and gun is quite community focused as they had a nightly kid movie night being advertised on their counter.  That seems really cute.  The place has a lot of space to chill and do your work.  The free wifi helps with that.  I ordered my usual of almond milk flat white was quickly taken and started immediately.  I like how a bit of the store is dedicated to selling plants... it gives a nice life to the place.

Flat White with almond milk - It had a bit more large foam bubbles than I'm used to and this may have made the ratio a little off for the milk to espresso.  The bean also had an interesting bitter note that may not be my favourite but it was still fairly good drink overall.  3.5/5",0
trn_6993,"I came here purely based off of Adam T's recommendation, and my homie did me right. 

When I hear that there's a great restaurant inside of local casino I tend to call, ""bullshit,"" but Bottiglia Cucina is the real deal. The vibe of this place is bustling, fun and feels ""young"" not old and stuffy, which is where most local spots tend to falter. 

Bottigula offers a full open kitchen/dining room, a large outdoor patio, and decent sized bar and lounge area if you're just looking for a few drinks. We showed up early for our reservations stopped at the bar for a quick drink and light bite before the main meal event. The bar is great, and I could have easily eaten dinner here and been happy. We sampled the charred octopus, and a few martinis and both were perfect. The octopus was very tender and just a touch chewy. Once we sat down, we started with Meatballs and Carbonara Mac n Cheese and shared the Braised Short Rib. I don't have one bad thing to say about any of the food, everything came out fast and hot, which is great because they were busy on this night. 

Out of everything we ate, I highly recommend the Charred octopus and Braised Short Rib, order these, and you'll walk out a happy camper. I also keep hearing that this place has an excellent Sunday brunch. Time to brunch so hard.",1
trn_6994,"Reminds me of the well stocked Blue Goose Market near my hometown in St Charles, IL, a well curated upscale grocery, in that it stocks many of the regional favorites of the upper Midwest, and quite a few other regions as well -- was able to get Beecher's cheese from Seattle here, Palacios chorizo from Spain, Magnotta cab franc & Riesling icewine from the Niagara region -- have never seen this outside a LCBO -- and they also carry Nueske's bacon (!!!), as well as other items from them. Open extremely early at 0600. Service is fantastic.",1
trn_6995,"We are not ever, ever, ever, EVER going back to this place. This was our first visit and that was enough for a lifetime. We should have picked up and left as soon as we saw the lack of cleanliness of the bathrooms. If the bathrooms are dirty in a restaurant - the kitchen isn't much different. Take it from me, I know this. I sell into this industry and visit restaurants all day long. Good clean restrooms=good clean kitchen. 
So the place is as dark as dark can get in the middle of the day. All the blinds are closed so TV viewing is best, I guess. Our waitress Emily L takes our order with little enthusiasm but that's ok. 20 minutes later I'm asking where our sandwich and bowl of chili are. She says,"" It will be out in a little while."" WRONG ANSWER
The correct answer is ""I'm sorry, I will check for you."" I expect hot food to appear in 15 minutes or less - in any restaurant. That's the correct wait time.
That's all! Emily L got a $2 tip...and that was generous.
Never again.  Or yeah, the food wasn't very good either. There are better places.",-1
trn_6996,"I feel sorry for anyone who pays money to eat here. Just do yourself a favor and steer clear of this buffet! Not only is it expensive, on Memorial Day weekend our family paid $42 per person - I imagine on a regular day it's a little less - but the food is some of the lowest quality buffet food I've had. 

Exception: the lamb was good as was some of the desserts, namely cheesecake. 

The seafood that they offered, snow crab legs and tiny shell-on shrimp. C'mon, like I feel bad that people actually think snow crab is that tasteless!! For the record, seafood is actually super sweet when fresh and prepared right. I ended up eating pizza, which wasn't that good anyhow. But who really goes to a buffet to eat carbohydrates.",-1
trn_6997,"Super friendly, knowledgeable, showed up on time, and were very thorough. Cleaned up any mess that was made before wrapping everything up. Would absolutely recommend!",1
trn_6998,"We visited the spa yesterday for a treatment and massage. My wife and I enjoyed the massage and foot scrub, we found that the people there were hard to understand and asked at one stage if we wanted a hot stone massage and we thought why not. When we got to the end, they charged us another $10 each which had not been explained to us, then the $10 each for the tip. May come back again but just letting everyone know this is what they do.",1
trn_6999,This location sucks. The 2 females working when I came were so friggin rude wow.. I don't think I've ever been treated so rude for absolutely no reason. They also took none of my 15 items (all designer names) I found that odd :/ will not be returning. Save your time and Go to another location!!,-1
trn_7000,"This breakfast is like a great home cooked meal. Delicious food, portions are enough to share. Customer service was good .Dain our server was nice and have great suggestions on what to order. The decor was cute and I loved that the servers wore their pajamas to work.",1
