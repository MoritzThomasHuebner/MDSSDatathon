test_1,"Petit dejeuner le weekend a lauberge, toujours excellent, en fait on ce trompe pas en allent a lauberge du dragon rouge"
test_2,Glad we found this place. The gelato is awesome. They have a large selection of flavors all made there and let you sample before deciding on one. Friendly knowledgeable  staff  as well.
test_3,"I'm so disappointed in this place. The mechanics do good work, but the service writers are a mess. 

My last three visits have all taken 3-4 times longer than quoted because of parts order screw ups.  They even sent me home once after 4 hours because they couldn't finish an oil change, air and fuel filter swap in one visit. That's the easy stuff, guys. 

Today the service writers joked with me about always making me wait, while two mechanics hung around the lobby because they couldn't move forward on half-done jobs. When my car is filling a bay, that means the poor schlump scheduled for the next timeslot isn't getting out of there any time soon. 

I know this location was worried that the train construction was going to kill their business. They should be more worried about their reputation. A new VW mechanic opened up nearby, so don't expect me to be back to Network. Who has the time?


Note on the response from the business: Yeah, I know. That's why I always call a day or two in advance to ask you guys to have the filters. Your organizational issues aren't my fault, and I'm disappointed that I'd be blamed. Sorta makes my point."
test_4,"After finally being able to find a stylist i loved who dyed my hair, she moved to Vancouver. I have been scared to find another hair stylist to cut my hair as I've been through horror stylists. I decided to come here because of the great yelp reviews and that it is very close to my home. I woke up in the morning and called for an appointment and went right away. I didn't mind what stylist i got and i ended up with Sam. He was very patient with me and was clearly very knowledgeable in his field. I washed my hair right before and he asked if he could wet it. He ended up putting conditioner in my hair without charge which i was afraid he was going to without letting me know.

I showed him a picture i wanted which was the style i had currently had but just wanted a trim and he did just that. He gave me tips along the way and giving recommendations. He took his time with my suggestions that took 1 hour. He was very easy to talk to and was very kind to me. I would 100% recommend Sam."
test_5,Been going to them for yrs now they are great! Dr. Holt & Kathy are very nice! :)
test_6,"I held off visiting M's due to some early negative reviews but I saw none of those negatives on my recent first-time visit.  Excellent food, varied menu, prompt and courteous service.  Another reviewer here claimed they had detailed descriptions of their rolls -- I didn't see such descriptions but at this stage of my sushi journey the lack of descriptions isn't a big problem.  Everyone has calamari appetizers but they aren't always well done.  M's are spot-on in taste, texture and presentation.  Salmon rolls and tuna rolls were great.  I must have been there during Happy Hour though I didn't see any indications of what those hours were but I was there by myself and it wouldn't have made a huge difference anyway.  I'll just say it was a very enjoyable meal for a reasonable price.  I could do without the TV's and the sports channels.  It invites calls and hoots from the audience, particularly the bar area.  But it's really hard to get away from that trend.  There are many really good sushi restaurants in this neighborhood so it's hard to give an accurate rank.  But M's is definitely in my top 5.  My location when the sushi urge hits me will be the deciding factor."
test_7,"I did have the salmon on the menu.  But wait!  It came with small pieces of pork belly and it was delish!  The bread that they serve had grilled onions on it.

Service was kinda slow but over all ok."
test_8,Great food and it tastes healthy! My favorite is medeterranean chicken or pita and hummus with salad.
test_9,"BEWARE!  This company is incompetent, rude, dishonest, and sends out repair people who do not even know what they are doing and are also rude. 
The first technician guessed that a certain part for frig was needed and a week later came back, put it in, and it was no better.  Same tech was sent back the next week decided it was maybe another part and so another week with frig not keeping food cold.  And each time he took things apart it worked even worse.  The third time a different tech was sent out as I was told the first one was no longer working there.  I was told by the manager that I would be the last call of the day, between 4-5:00 and would be called a half hour in advance to let me know tech was on the way.   I was in an out of service area with my visiting family at about 2pm when a voicemail was left saying the tech was at my house.  About 3pm I called the office and was rudely told by the manager that the tech was at the house and since I was not there my appointment was cancelled and no one was coming back.  I told him they had no right to do that but he didn't care and told me he would try to have someone there in the morning. 

 So more rearranging my schedule and the tech comes and tells me she was driving around for 15 minutes trying to find my house.  So much for the lie about her being there the day before.  She told me she tried calling me and since I did not answer that was it.  Then she opened my frig and asked ME where the part was supposed to go that was ordered because she didn't know!  Then she said she didn't think that was the right part and proceeded to have an hour long conversation with the office with them trying to figure it out while she took everything apart.  She told me another part would have to be ordered, laughed about it in front of me with the person on the phone, and again rudely told me it was my fault for not being there the day before.   I will not deal with this company anymore.   Worst customer service ever!"
test_10,"Theres something seriously wrong with the owner of this place. Saw him kick patrons out of the restaurant and call the police on them for seemingly no reason what so ever. Caused a big scene and started yelling at a table of customers. Does not make a good name for yourself in a small town where word gets around quick, And believe me, word WILL get around...
Food was only average. I think I've had better from a high school cafeteria or on an airplane to be honest. If you want GOOD food, I would recommend skipping this place and hitting up some of the other mom and pop restaurants in town. Not to mention the way the owner acted on Dirty Dining. Does not look good... No one wants to be treated that way."
test_11,"This place is amazing, inexpensive, and fast!  The staff is also very thoughtful and friendly.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to alter their clothing."
test_12,"Good food and good service a bit over price for my opinion.
 the rice should come with the main dish, a little bit slow but that was accepted from an Indian restaurant
I ordered the Baingan Bhartha which is vegan ordered a side rice and the combination was really good, a bit spicy but no too much.
Go check this place out"
test_13,"To begin, no one greeted us at the door. Seemed like the waitresses were more intent on conversing with one another then getting us seated. The head hostess rolled her eyes at us when we asked to be seated on the patio. A very poor first impression.

After being seated, we noticed that the waitress always seemed rushed. Even quipping that it was a ""slow night"", we still went through 10-15 minute periods where we were not waited upon. We waited 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order and then another hour to receive our food.

The bison burger was a complete disappointment. It came dry and cold. Even the highly recommended ""Mac and cheese"" side came dry. Nothing seemed to be seasoned, not even black pepper or salt!

My friend's order of ostrich burger was no different. Again, dry, and bland. Neither of us could finish our meals.

The owner, however, was an exceedingly kind individual. You could tell that he cared about our experience. He offered us free drinks and comped our meals.

To end off our night, we find out that the waitress had mixed up the glass of wine with a more expensive glass. So what i thought was a $8 glass of wine became $10 (a small difference, but just another mistake).

Overall, i would give this place another try. But, i would hold off until they got their act together. If things don't shape up soon, im not sure how they could keep going."
test_14,"Just average.  It's cool that it is in the basement but they pack you in like sardines.  My wife and I felt like we were on top of the other tables.  We had the halibut ceviche, average. Escargot appetizer, ok. My wife had the salmon, average and I had the halibut checks, again average.  

If you want seafood, I suggest skipping this place and go somewhere else."
test_15,"Fast, friendly service at this jewelry repair shop in the Scottsdale Mall. They fixed my broken silver chain in less than 30 minutes. When I returned to pick it up, they polished my other jewelry for free. Highly recommended."
test_16,Awesome place. Found a great wall ornament and friendly staff makes it worth the drive.
test_17,"A great neighbourhood health food store! Surprised to find GF things I can eat here like Live prepackaged salads and kimchi, as well as Nancy Greniers' fantastic vegan ch√®vre. 

I send in various people to shop for me and they report that either they were treated very kindly or that they were treated like a potential thief and did not feel very comfortable. 

Great find in the 'hood. Someone here has en eye for true quality instead of fake ""healthy"" food."
test_18,"5 stars for the food, which was delicious, but 3 stars for the service.  

We got Yokohama style ramen, a fried chicken rice bowl, and some gyoza.  The gyoza and ramen were delicious, and the chicken was decent.

The waitresses were very kind and helpful, but they obviously needed more help.  I got my ramen about 5 min after I ordered it.  About 10 min later the waitress walked close enough by that I could ask for some chopsticks/silverware.  5 min after that the gyoza arrived.  This was some of the best I've ever had!  10 minutes later, after the ramen and gyoza were nearly completely gone, my wife's chicken arrived.  We had pretty much assumed that they had forgotten the chicken and we were almost ready to leave by the time we got it...

Even though the service was not great, I'll probably go back just bc the ramen and gyoza were so good...  that's what it's all about I guess."
test_19,"Reservation = walk in.  Pointless to make reservations.  We made a reservation the day before for 11:00am the next day morning. When we arrived we are not being served but was asked to wait.  This is  pointless for reservation, as at the same time they still take walk in and people who has reservation is under the same queue with the walk in.  After 30min, we asked how much longer will be the wait? The lady answered ""no idea, I don't know"". Avoid this restaurant."
test_20,"Unfortunately, the second experience wasn't that great. We did the Bunker room escape which was ok in itself, not my favorite room we've done, but ok. The overall experience, however, wasn't good. 

They explained the clues system to us, (you lose 1 min for the first clue, 3 min for the second clue, and 5 for the third), and off we went. Well, we got stuck and decided to request the first clue. They were NOT paying attention at all to where we were at in the story. They deducted the one minute and gave us a clue that we'd got like 10 min prior to that! It took us another 3-4 min to get them up to speed and since they couldn't hear us we had to sign to get them to understand that that clue wasn't helpful at all.

Same thing happened with the second clue...:((( We ran out of time on the last puzzle and when they showed us the clue we were supposed to get with a black light it looked so faded that you could barely see it! They didn't really keep that up at all!

Not escaping the room is fine, but it's incredibly frustrating to waste time on smth they were supposed to be monitoring. When we left the room the only thing we got was ""ok, bye guys"". We didn't even get to take pictures or anything. The employee really couldn't care less whether or not we had a good time...

Not sure we'll be back there..."
test_21,"We've tried a few different Chinese delivery places. I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food. But this place had some good food. I like the shrimp lo mein and kung pow shrimp. The shrimp was juicy, unlike some other places we tried. It is also a good price with huge portions! 
Don't order the poo poo platter though, none of the items in it were good."
test_22,"This is a terrific spa on the west side of the Valley. Talented and caring folks throughout. Brenda is the Appointment Whisperer. She has always been able to accommodate our needs and schedule. The only reason this isn't a 5-Star rating is because the steam room hasn't been functional as of my last few visits. Probably over a year since it worked. C'mon Renaissance, you want to be a player in the West Valley, at least get it fixed!"
test_23,"For the most part, everything has worked out fine but I like to get things done early and Sundays are about my only day to do it. Not opening the gates until 10:00 on Sundays may be convenient for them, but not everyone else and certainly not for me and especially in the summer. Then, I called on Labor Day and was told the office was closed but gates would be open...50 miles later I arrived mid-day with a truckload to find closed gates. How hard is it to get the person answering the phones the correct business hours?"
test_24,"Soooooo...as I've mentioned in previous reviews, I love Mexican food. I had been talking about this place for over a month and my boyfriend surprised me by bringing me here on a date. We both left agreeing that we will never come back again. 

We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly. She brought chips and salsa and our waters. When it came time to order, I was disappointed that there was no a la carte options. None of the dinner combinations had what I wanted but I was told that I could not add a single empanda, even for a cost. I was disappointed but willing to keep an open mind. 

We ordered mimosas and I would tell you about them, but they never came. The manager and waitress apologized several times. We said it was cool as long as we weren't charged for them.

Now to the food. The chips and salsa were actually really good. Our meals arrived and I had ordered the #12- half quesadilla, enchilada and taco. My boyfriend had the #11- two empanadas, two stuffed jalape√±os, and two tacos. We both were not impressed. The beef on my taco was room temperature. The enchilada had been laid on top of the beans so it was soggy. The quesadilla was something I could easily make at home. My boyfriend liked the stuffed jalape√±os. He said his tacos were just okay and the dough of the empanada was not good. It tasted kinda like a funnel cake and was very greasy. Also, he ordered a pork taco and there were huge chunks of fat. In fact, we thought maybe it was a piece of shrimp but no - pure fat. I also thought the rice and beans were bland and left 95% of them on the plate. 

I wanted to love this place. The location is great (although parking can be rough) and I had high hopes. But it was terrible. In fact, I would be surprised if this place stays in business. I don't mean that to be hateful but it is my honest opinion. Based on my experience and the other reviews, this place seems to be consistently bad. 

If you are reading this and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go to Maverick Rock Taco or Three Amigos instead (see my other reviews). 

Bottom line: underwhelmed in every way."
test_25,Reasonable prices for really good food.  Had the short rib for dinner.  Very friendly staff.
test_26,"This is going to be short and sweet. I have seen 5 different Cirque shows, and just saw O May -18. They are all good but absolutely loooved Love the best."
test_27,"My wife & I were exploring this part of the city & stumbled upon this charming cafe. We took the omelette & a crepe. So so so good. Friendly staff, also!"
test_28,"I've never purchased a vehicle here but this is my fourth time bringing my Prius here for service and the service is horrible. The first two times, I made afternoon appointments and I waited for over 2 hours. The second two times, I made 7am and 8am appointments, thinking early morning appointments would be shorter. I was wrong. I am currently in my second hour of waiting for an oil change. I'll never come back to get my car serviced. Not sure what the point of scheduling appointments is when the waits are this long."
test_29,This place makes the best enchiladas I have tried & not just for a fast food place even better than the one's I've tried at Bonito/Lindo Michoacan. Prices are really fair also. Love it
test_30,"This is cheese sauce for nachos that the gal was stocking 
These were dumped on floor then stocked"
test_31,Staff is friendly! The doctor is very vice and I actually don't hate going to the dentist because of this place!
test_32,"VIBE
If I lived in Montreal, this would be my regular cafe. From the cute mural on the wall to the free wi-fi (I think) and all-out general dark and brooding but light vibe/atmosphere to the donuts (OMG the donuts), I'm a FAN. 

I DRANK/ATE
I had my usual chai latte. It would be nice if they had cinnamon to flavour it up a bit. Not the best chai but the gold stars go to the lime donuts. I was lucky to get one! 
They also have fancy/schmance hot dogs here and you get two big ass ones for $9. Hearty. On the list. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
I hate sardines but this Sardine is not smelly or tastes awful. Definitely a fave in Mile End. Ahh good to be back!"
test_33,"I find it hard to believe that anyone would rate a Coco's a 5 star experience, but to each their own. I happened to find this location pretty much ASS when I happened in here with Mom and Grandma in tow. 

Growing up in Phoenix, Coco's and Bob's Big Boy (then JB's), and Village Inn were the only coffee shop type restaurants around and Coco's was always good. Sadly, the memory of the chain and the reality of this location didn't match up. 

We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and though it wasn't my choice to eat here, I agreed. Grandma was hungry and wanted pancakes. We walked in to a pretty packed restaurant and were seated fairly quickly by a teenage host. We sat and sat and sat and sat looking at our menus and me looking around at other tables who were also sitting to either order, get their checks or their food. Turned out not only was it the ""B"" team, it was probably the ""C"" team. When our waitress finally arrived to take our order, I realized she was the only one working the entire dining room and one other waitress was working the other half of the restaurant. The hosts (2 teens I noticed) were standing around basically doing nothing and the kitchen seemed behind on getting food out to customers. 

Grandma had her pancakes-I had to track down the coffee to refill her coffee (and several other customers), Mom had a BLT which was skimpy and I had a cup of their soup of the day (cream of broccoli) which was like eating a spoon full of salt and nothing could help it go down. 

I was surprised that this location especially being located in Sun City had such a lack of employees working. I was also surprised at the amount of families there-but I forget that Sunday is often go to lunch after Church day.

I will skip this location in the future and hit up the JB's next door (Village Inn?) or actually get some decent coffee shop type grub at Cracker Barrel down the street. Oh, and if Grandma wants pancakes again, I might even venture just past the 101 on Bell and hit up IHOP before I hit up this place again."
test_34,"Tonight was one of the best times my friends and I have ever been to Topgolf. Usually the servers are nice but tonight, our server Chandler was outstanding. He was so welcoming and funny and made our time very special at TopGolf! Thank you so much Chandler, and thank you TopGolf for hiring him, he is the best!"
test_35,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Northstar Services Dryer Vent Cleaning! Matt meticulously cleaned the dryer vent and also tested the system thoroughly afterwards to make sure everything was functioning properly. He really went above and beyond and provided excellent customer service.
test_36,"By all means your lucky you got That! Was so hungry for the godfather sandwich which is my all time fave.
So I brag to my buddy what a great place this is,,boy was he let down
I ordered the godfather like I have so many times and my buddy a Philly cheesesteak.also a couple salads..i said to the young lady cashing us out is that our order ( she was in la la land)she said no,that lady is wrapping yours up now she hand is the bag an we took the 20 min.ride home.we get back to my place and as sure as God made green apples it happens.  Our order is jacked up! my sandwich was a turkeyclub  with so much mustard on it it looked like it was bleeding profusely and my buddy with the Philly chs.stk was so greasy that you could have wrung it out.  Disgusting! When I called about my order the mgr.kept calling me hun and sweety.nothing worse then being upset ANd someone old enough  to be your daughter is disrespectfully calling you hun and sweety! I asked if they can just make me another tomorrow and she said no its policy. If you can't come that day ,we have to mail you a coupon..just one day?  Is that asking to Much? I hate coupons! Well I'll take my 30 min trip to the one in solon,. At least they are respectful and always have my order right..but I will say the African American guy was awsome and efficient and had class .
You saved it with two stars !  Won't go back.....ever"
test_37,"They do good work here - small, clean, and a little on the expensive side but it seems to be worth it."
test_38,"Not a bad hotel, it's a typical Westin for the most part. 
Pizza is really good from room service. Bathroom is very small. Comfortable bed. Convenient location, walking distance to a nice restaurants but two days in a row at 10am they have been conducting fire alarm test in each room which is very loud, annoying and inconvenient. It has woke me up both days early in the morning."
test_39,"Yay! We're from NYC & we couldn't find any great coffee places & we found it! Trust me,it is worth the travel over to Old Port Montreal. I had a honey chai latte & my friend had a honey soy latte. Perfection. If you're hungry, get the Panatoast. French toast,bacon,& cheddar cheese,topped with maple syrup! Devine! Go,now!"
test_40,"The food is good, but not great. Service was bad. Waitress came over like once in between meal. We were there for about 45 minutes. Table next to us left and had forgotten their leftover dessert. Staff immediately took it, and a girl came over 2 minutes later for it and waitress in a very rude manner said they through it away without a care. Will probably not come back to this place."
test_41,"Five stars because for a free zoo, this definitely surpassed my expectations. Definitely recommend donating to keep such a great community organization alive. My favorite exhibit was the polar bears! Plenty to see and do for all ages."
test_42,Absolutely horrible food and service. It took well over an hour to get food and there was only one other table in the restaurant. Buns were stale. Meat was WAY over cooked. DO NOT EAT HERE. SAVE YOURSELF.
test_43,"This is my second visit with Genet for a Brazilian, and I will continue to keep coming back to her! She is such a nice person, professional and makes you feel comfortable during your entire visit. Her private suite has a welcoming atmosphere and is very clean. The Rain Salon location is very nice, clean and close to home for me, which is a plus. I'm so glad to have found her!"
test_44,"Decent indian food restaurant located at lawrence and victoria park. Tried couple of thing there. Their butter chicken and chicken masala are decent. But stay away from their beef/lamb items, i dont know what kind of meat is it but taste really weird and bad."
test_45,I looked at their menu. I saw Szechuan dumplings in Hot Oil. My mouth was watering. I called to place order. They don't have that. WTF??? Oh well...back to surfing.
test_46,Really cool venue and my food is always delicious. Service can sometimes be an issue as this place is so large.
test_47,"Boy, has this place changed over the years! The price has always been steep, but it used to be that you would get great, fresh food, service and entertainment in return. Not anymore. 

The wait staff is generally sour and unprofessional. We came in on a Monday afternoon and they clearly struggled to find hibachi seating arrangements during this slow period. 

Luckily, on this Monday, we were able to get the one chef with a modicum of talent and personality. When Nakama first opened, all of the chefs were friendly and full of tricks. That's what we come for. The whole point of hibachi restaurants is to be entertained, not just sit around a sweaty table. Most of Nakama's chefs nowadays will just sit there in silence as they grill your steak. 

The food is still good for the most part, although the sushi isn't very fresh, and they have a tendency to bring appetizers during or after your main course. 

A lot has changed over the years. Between the loud music on weekends, reward cards, and specials, it's clear Nakama is trying to do too much instead of just concentrating on good hibachi. The bar makes a killing on weekends, though, so I doubt they'll change. 

As an aside, they have a broken ""gong"" that they ring on your birthday, except that they deaden the noise, so it sounds like a fork hitting a table. Come on guys!"
test_48,"It was good. I do kind of wish they had vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, but the lamb ones were also tasty."
test_49,"If you haven't dined here, you are certainly missing out - yeah you! They whip up Peruvian food with immense love and flavor! 

They have the most incredible Lomo Saltado I have ever had. Steak and potatoes elevated to new heights! They make it with tenderloin strips, sauteed onions and tomatoes, plated over french fries and rice soaking in all of the delicious brown stir-fry sauce. This is a winning combination! We added a few dashes of salt and it really woke up the entire dish. Flavor rating: 5/5

The Lomo Saltado is served with their house green ""aji"" sauce and baby, that sauce is to die for!! It's slightly spicy, very smooth, herbaceous and somewhat tangy. It brought so much life to the table; it was incredibly fresh and vibrant! This is one of the best versions I have ever tasted. You know I asked for multiple refills - heck, I can see myself dipping a boot in that sauce and enjoying it. Flavor rating: 5/5

We also tried the Papa A La Huancaina which is boiled potatoes swimming in a rich and creamy yellow sauce called Huanca√≠na. It comes garnished with some black olives and a hard boiled egg slice. As we never had this dish before, my fianc√© and I thought the boiled potatoes were too simple, but the cream sauce was truly excellent. Flavor rating: 4/5

The portions are large and ideal for sharing. We left completely satisfied and stuffed with a large doggy bag with leftovers of both dishes."
test_50,"Service was very good & the food was great, we had the nachos with beef - all of the ingredients were fresh made , the refried beans were awesome  . We both had the steak & cheese subs with fries , again very good. Unless you are very big eaters you could easily order one meal - split it  & be full our bill was less than $40 with enough left over to feed at-least or 2 or 3 more people. Not to mention the place is set up real cool - if you haven't been you need to & you will come back , I know we will."
test_51,"How does this place not have 5 stars? The food is so omg good! The staff is always friendly and they always remind me that the red sauce isn't vegetarian, which is super helpful! The cornbread and the mashed potato enchiladas and so good! Definitely a great place for vegetarians!"
test_52,"This is my favorite buffet in vegas. I go every year. Best pasta station I've ever experienced. And this is the only buffet that I eat dessert first because they have so many things that are delicious. Mini donuts,  chocolate covered strawberries, and these moist cupcakes! Samoas, salad, and ribs also. Its small but what they have is great."
test_53,"The Garlic Knots were so warm and dripping with butter and the marinara dipping sauce was so good we almost licked the bowl clean.  We ordered a Supreme Pizza with ham and I must admit, it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  The dough was tender and a little chewy, just as it should be.  The toppings were fresh and the homemade sausage was absolutely delicious.  The sauce was perfect.  Can't wait to come back for a visit so we can have it again!"
test_54,"Good Egg has gone ""corporate "" and they have lost me ...probably permanently.  Whenever the bean counters take over, the customer  (BTW we pay the bills!) loses. 

A less than complete list of disappointments  would include :

1.  hard to read menu
2.  most menu items are overpriced 
3. Have ro ask for ice when ordering water.
4.  butter provided with pancakes very inadequate 
5. high turnover in servers. Their longest time server, left recently.   She was the best and probably tossed her hands in the air after all the ""improvements ""
6. less than friendly environment.
7. to go cups about 50% smaller than they used to be.

Are the bean counters responsible for all this?  This surely would be the case directly  for many of the above; their ""desires "" probably has had an effect on the rest. 

Although the business deserves a 2 in my mind,  there are two mitigating things that got me to a reluctant 3.  They have remodeled the inside so it looks a lot nicer and  more contemporary. 

Saddest thing of all is that this used to be one of my favorite restaurants.   Gave them high marks on Yelp and used to direct and/or take people here.   No mo!

There are many far better places near here.  Check them out."
test_55,We visit this museum last week and could not have been more impressed. From the very helpful lady at the front desk Sharon all the way through. The period Houses complete with furnishings just totally amazed me. Where else can you walk into a house built in 1910 complete with all the furnishings? Then you you walk into houses built in 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 including a travel trailer and a mobile court from the 40s.And they have a wedding chapel  Where more marriages were performed in a 24 hour period that any chapel on earth. How about one every three minutes for 24 hours? I was actually amazed. To see old TV says and equipment from the 50s made me smile. I grew up fixing those TVs as a child at my dads TV shop. If I could give this place six stars I would.
test_56,I hate this place but it's next to the hospital I work at. Much of the staff are mentally retarded. Overall they just take too fucking long. It's insane. Avoid. Bye
test_57,"Went to Mai Thai for the second time tonight thanks to my sister's request and a coupon.  I must say that for the second time in a row, the food was awesome.  My son ordered the spicy basil noodles with tofu at spice level 2 and my sister ordered it as well but with chicken and at level three.  I tasted both and the three was a bit too spicy for my liking.  Very good, but just a tad too much heat for my tastebuds.  The two was just right.  I cannot remember the name of the stir fry I got, but it had cashews, green peppers, pea pods, mushrooms, onions and baby corn.  It was absolutely delicious!!!  I could have drank the sauce through a straw!  We also ordered the crab rangoons for an appetizer.  They were tasty, but I felt they had a little too much of a cream cheese flavor.  I prefer more crab.  The staff was very friendly and attentative on both occasions.  We will definitely be back, no coupon needed.  I will happily pay full price for such excellent food.  We live in Concord and have tried Thai Emerald.  The service was also good, but Mai Thai's flavors were so much better!"
test_58,"Highly recommend! The crab sandwich, lobster roll and fish and chips were stellar! Only reason not 5 stars~ wish they had more seating and liquor license, would be great to enjoy a beer with it"
test_59,"I'm giving an extra star because convicted felon OJ Simpson hung out here on the eve of his trial. You've got to admit that having an alleged murder as one of your first clientele is pretty cool and it was newsworthy too in that it showed up in the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Anyway every-time I go here I receive awful service, if you're not a regular degenerate gambler blowing Benjamins on the slot machines like the idiot you are then don't expect decent service at all. I ordered a drink and 5 people ahead of me had their orders filled before me and the place wasn't even that busy. My drink was ""on the house"" but I was about to walk out at that point.

Speaking of happy hour, the Happy Hour specials are called the ""Trailer Park Trio"", $1 beers in a Can: PBR, Hamm's and Olympia (Here's a little secret folks; they're all the same beer, they only taste different because of the packaging), 1 dollar sliders and 1 dollar fries. Nobody even orders these specials, it's almost as if they are trying to get you NOT to order them. Also if this is a bar then why don't they have any beer on tap? 

 This place is more of a casino than a restaurant, i'm willing to bet they make nearly all of their money on slot machines. Virtually all of the food is overpriced and sub-par, save for the Steaks and Philly Fries. They even stopped serving a choice of fries or salad with the steaks on Sundays and are now charging $4.50 extra for a single order of fries.

If you like your steaks but would like to avoid the douche-baggery and coked-out drinking on the job bartenders here then just go to Sedona. It's owned by the same restaurant group so it's the same food more or less and a nicer place too."
test_60,"A week after getting acrylic nails done, almost all are lifting. This has never happened to me. I won't return to get my nails done here."
test_61,"Why do people wait in hour long lines for a buffet? I guess it's Vegas. We had passes to avoid the wait, and figured why not gorge ourselves a little.

For a buffet, it was fairly impressive. The sushi alone propels the Bellagio above most Vegas buffets I've heard about. But it is still a buffet. You won't spot George Clooney eating here."
test_62,"Mediterranean (and my 1900th review)

I was looking for a healthy option in Las Vegas and looking at what was available in the Cosmopolitan (and checking with the bartender) I found my way up to Estiatorio Milos.

I hit the bar first as there was a wait - I had no reservation - so had a cocktail in their very nice, but a little too brightly lit bar.  Bartender was very pleasant and made enough chit-chat to make the time go by.

Scored a table and got down to the business of eating.  Since it was just me and I wasn't starving, I skipped the apps and went right for dinner.  I ordered the milokopi (baked in sea salt that is hand picked from the Island of Kythira) which was outstanding.  A side order of grilled veggies completed my meal and I could not have been happier.

Very good wait staff and they even got me to have some Loukoumades and I rolled out of there fat and happy.

Definitely the way to go if you are looking for something different - beware, it is not cheap though so leave the kiddies in the room.

Give it a shot!"
test_63,"Love stone and vine - just a great 
Neighborhood spot - nice menu and great service always ."
test_64,"So happy that reverse happy hour is still in place! 

I've always loved the idea of their happy hour (10-midnight) and was disappointed when I heard it may be ending. We were in the area on a Friday night and stopped in for a drink, to find it's still going strong! Even better! The food is outstanding for the price and the cozy upstairs seating is perfect for a late night date or drink!"
test_65,"I really like buffet style food, so this review is difficult for me.  The buffet at The MGM Grand is pretty crappy.  I took part in breakfast and dinner at the buffet, and was very surprised to see some of the same foods at both!  The prime rib at dinner was mostly fat, the vegetables were tasteless, the shrimp were out too long, and became slimy.  If you want bacon and eggs for breakfast, then the buffet is adequate, but don't waste your money here for dinner."
test_66,"Great selection and prices for old comics!!  Didn't have that much time but from what I was able to see we were not disappointed.  Had a great selection of toys as well!  Store is very clean and organized!  Staff was friendly, but they didn't offer any help."
test_67,"I have to give Juan's five stars. Our party of four was immediately seated, and we had immediate service though the place was pretty busy.

They have a number of different Mexican beers on tap, and they had a happy hour going when we were there at about 6:00. 

Chips and salsa came immediately and they were excellent. We had chicken fajitas that can be ordered for two, and they came out with a spectacular sizzling, flaming, presentation.

They were dynamite, and the portions allowed us to take quite a bit home for later.

The server was real and down to earth but very professional, polite, and competent.

I will certainly return the next time we feel like eating Mexican when we go out."
test_68,"Lady was very sweet she gave us a coconut drink for the inconvenience of a ugly Critter come into our table & this nasty little cockroaches staring at our Face. 
Besides all that the food was just OK ."
test_69,"The food is delicious.  You'll more than likely stand in a really long line.  Don't fret, it goes by pretty quick. Get the eggslut--it's the best thing on the menu.  Sandwiches are good, too.  Although a bit in the pricey side, I'd go back."
test_70,"The food is so good ordered the fried chicken dinner and it was on point! The watermelon juice was so good and fresh, rice and beans sooooo good!!! Taste just like the food in Belize. This place is a must try!! Coming back for the shrimp omelette and the snapper. This is going to be my regular spot!"
test_71,"Unfair and takes a advantage of people. Went there with my fianc√© at the time and booked the hall for our wedding which was in 3 weeks. We paid her 1400$ as a date reservation. About 4 days later we had a family problem so we canceled the party and we thought that there will be a small fee since we only cancelled 4 days later but NOOO she wanted the whole thing, THE WHOLE FREAKIN 1400$. So my husband kept going back and forth with her but she kept saying "" the manager "" wont return it which im pretty sure that shes the manager but shes wanted to take the whole amount and blame it on someone else to look innocent, and yeah we weren't allowed to talk to that mysterious manager, shes the only one there all the time and her name is on everything (Susan by the way) . She ended up taking 700$ from the amount which we discovered that we only should have paid 500$ according to the contract as a reservation and cancellation fee is 200$ ""if you cancel in less that a month before the event but we booked it in less than a month !!! And of course that what my husband told me, she might not even returned anything from the 1400$ and he lied to avoid feeling embarrassed in front of me. She did not take under consideration that we are young (24 years) and we collected that money from hard work so we could have a nice wedding party which we didn't have after all. Thanks Susan ..."
test_72,"What a mess!

The AZ state fair opens at noon. And I left my house at 11:45am. At around  12:10 I crossed 19th Ave and Grand Ave (the corner where the state fair is located) and it took me 1 hour to go 2 blocks!!!!!!!!!!!! The traffic was backed up for at least 1/2 mile because the ONLY entrance to the fair is at 19th Ave and Monte Vista. That is the only way to get to their parking.

There were no police directing traffic, no traffic management. No stoplights being monitored. People from 3 lanes over were all trying to get into my lane, plus there were people coming from the north that wanted to turn into the parking rd. In addition, there were delivery trucks and workers trying to get out of the fair grounds and each time they had to try and stop traffic to let those people out. Again, no police, no traffic management, just a couple of guys trying to stop 3 lanes of traffic.   

When I finally started to turn into the parking lot to pay, a lady cut me off. Then when we got to the cashier that had a big sign ""CASH ONLY"", the creep lady that cut me off insisted on paying with credit card. Who goes to the fair with no cash?? And of course it took about 10 minutes to get her cleared to proceed because they weren't set up for credit.     

I FINALLY parked my car at 1:15.

What a mess! It's no wonder the fair's attendance is down for the 4th straight year.

I've been to the fair 3 times and have never had such a difficult time. 

Well, I went to the fair to take pictures, and I did that for about 3 hours. I visited the livestock barns and the craft barn. It was around 4 pm and I ran out of things to do so I left. And I didn't get any night pics, which i wanted to get. 

I also didn't spend a dime there. 

Also, it's Thursday.Right? And at noon onward there was tons of kids. What did they cancel school or something? In fact I'd say 90% of the people in attendance were of school age.
I certainly hope the kids didn't cut classes to attend the fair, but that wouldn't surprise me either in this town. [ EDIT: I found out later that schools were all off. Thus the big crowd of kids.]  

I'm from Minnesota and the AZ state fair doesn't come close to comparing to the MN state fair. I don't recall any parking issues at the MN state fair, and the AZ is basically just a bunch of food vendors mixed in with a few rides.

[ EDIT: I need to add that I was surprised at the complete lack of security or police presence at the fair, given they've had some trouble the past. There was also a complete lack of drinking fountains and healthier food choices. The livestock barns were poorly lit and in need of repair and I felt sorry for all the cows and sheep that were chained to the block walls. }  

Unless they move the AZ fair's location out further and have parking and traffic reorganized, I doubt I'll attend the AZ state fair again."
test_73,"Wow, I just had the most disgusting food there. It's really not worth anything. Can't find words. Just stay away, even if you are starving!! YUCK.
I just lost $13."
test_74,"Love this trendy, high end and friendly salon. Not pretentious but FUN and the decor is the cutest in town!! 

I have been coming to Amy for years but I know they have many other talented hair stylists here as well. Love GLO!!"
test_75,"Khoury's Fine Wine & Spirits is a sweet little store located on Eastern just after Silverado Ranch heading South.  This store is tucked away across from Lowe's, but definitely worth seeking.  The store is currently running some good promotions on most of their wine stock.  Bottles that were $65 have be chopped in half, and there are specials on the regular $12-30 bottles as well.  The store offers a fine selection of hard to find brews that I haven't even seen at Lee's."
test_76,"my fave buffet in vegas.  and it's part of the buffet of buffets too.

crab legs, chicken wangs, more crab legs, prime rib, more crab legs.

oh i swear to you, i'll be there for you, this is not a drive by ay ay ay ay

but really, i swear, the food here is of a higher quality than most of the other buffets in Vegas."
test_77,"I should just cut and paste my review of the Wicked spoon buffet to this. Food wise, somewhat similar. People say this is the best buffet in Vegas, I beg to differ. To me, it's like any other newer, big budget casino buffet. Food is fresh, place was clean, it's what to expect from a restaurant of a high-end hotel."
test_78,Luis treated us very well as we bought bikes for my twins.  Installed speedometer in minutes and helped us hook up the bike rack.  Excellent.
test_79,"If street tacos are your thing, then Waldo's is for you.  Authentic preparation, friendly staff.  

Don't be early though if you are looking for it and its your first time, as the food truck pulls up right at 6:00.  We drove around a bit until we saw the truck down the street, and then we followed it to the parking lot.  

No alcohol, so if you like your tacos with a cold cerveza you will need to bring your own"
test_80,"The Twins are fabulous! I purchased my Valley home from them and sold it with their guidance years later. Not only do they ensure you get the best deals coming and going, they put their personal touch on everything they do. Jenny's hand-holding, high availability, action-oriented approach made me feel secure every step of the way. Christie oversaw paperwork on the backend and came to the closing with a therapy Chihuahua and champagne. Perfect! They have the best minds in Real Estate but also know how to make the process fun. Now I can't wait to buy my next house with these sensational superstars!"
test_81,"Very pleased with the service, price, and response time that Rick (the owner) provides. He came out to give me a proper estimate, was flexible with my timeline, and his guys did a great job. They're #1 on Yelp for a reason."
test_82,Excellent authentic Italian!   Wild mushroom ravioli with lobster creamy cheese sauce was awesome!
test_83,"I wanted to like this place, but I think for me it fell short. The interior is great, very clean, and I love what they've done with the space. I ordered the seared tuna and a beet salad, and the tuna was just.. eek. I understand ""pepper crusted"" is right there on the menu, but it felt like eating a tablespoon of black pepper! The salad was okay, but the beets were undercooked, and the dressing was kinda bland. The service was good, and my partner enjoyed his meal, but for me I'm not sure I'd come back again."
test_84,"The meat lovers pizza is TO DIE FOR!!  Just a perfect balance of flavor between meats, sauce, & cheese.  The crust is the perfect combo of warm crunchy/chewy.  My husband has searched 35 years to find a pizza as good as he remembers from childhood (that doesn't exist anymore)...& he says this is SOOO much better!! 
The customer service is above and beyond the call.  Recently my dad was in ICU while visiting from MN.  My order was ""on the house"" as we have become regular customers over the last few months and just needed some comfort food in between long stretches in the hospital.
DON'T HESITATE. JUST COME HERE FOR A MEAL!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY ;)"
test_85,"Went for dinner. Delicious! I had the farfalle with sausage. I couldn't finish, but ate the leftovers the same night. My husband got gnocchi with vodka sauce. The sauce was so creamy, not super heavy, but very flavorful. We had the bocce balls for an appetizer. Secret family recipe. Now we know why..... highly recommend. We are looking forward to going back and trying more wonderful things off their menu.
Staff and ambience were very nice. Prices very reasonable."
test_86,"It was Easter and decided on Filipino food in our neighborhood.  We had a party of 6 and they automatically charged 18% gratuity.  We ate the buffet $10.99 pp which was mostly pork dishes; Pork sinigang, pork sisig, Lechon, dinuguan, pork and opo vegetable, pork caldereta.  They had Kare Kare 2 hrs earlier when we passed by but the lady said they weren't making anymore.  My husband really wanted it so he ordered the a la carte menu.  Kids ordered the halo halo and found a hair in it! We brought this to the attention of our server and another lady came out and asked, ""do you want me to bring another one?"" We said absolutely not, and did not offer a refund right away.  We all lost our appetite at this point.  She asked to see the hair and we had a look of disgust and asked why, and she said so she can find out who's it was!  We gave her the napkin and she left.  Later we went to get fruit and noticed they had a full tray of Kare Kare in the buffet area.  Wow we just finished ordering the Kare Kare for $12.99 and they did not offer a refund.  I as a Filipina thought the food was okay, Kare Kare was probably the best dish.  Service was ok, not deserving the automatic 18% for sure.  My husband said we won't be coming back ever again."
test_87,"We found this place online, as another similar facility was closed for weekdays. It was deserted! But it was super sweet to have the place pretty much to ourselves. The front desk attendant was very sweet. We played put put, and had fun in the arcade."
test_88,"Went their tonight they are usually pretty good, but tonight was terrible. I ordered tacos they were ok but the cheddar and potato wedges were just wedges no cheese or bacon but maybe on one wedge. The jack jr I ordered with cheese extra pickles and mayo looked like it had been sitting around for hours the bun was soggy and the whole thing was cold. The only positive was the two free egg rolls cause they didn't have a full order and even they were over cooked!!!"
test_89,"Terrible. Used to be the diamond in the rough every year up until this yearly trip. 

They reduced the cost of dinner to 28 dollars but the food selection is now half of what it used to be

Also, at the start of dinner at around 530pm one would expect fresh food, but most of it had the 4 hour under a dry heat lamp look to it.

Asked our server why the food looked stale and he said it shouldn't.. Ill pass it along to the manager *rollseyes*

Lastly food quality dramatically dropped. Save your money and goto McDonald's instead for better food quality"
test_90,"In a word: ""Bland"". Everything about this place is one step below average. The service; impersonal. The food; somewhat tasteless. The atmosphere; certainly not Japanese! In fact...everything is Chinese; employees, music and lack of customer service attitude (shares parking lot with the Bank of China office building, so go figure). But then again, what do you expect from an all you can eat place - something I didn't know until it was too late to run. Also, doesn't take AMEX."
test_91,Very disappointed!! I  wanted to enjoy a meal with my boyfriend and friend. I had brought food pre packaged from Flower child due to the fact that I have dietary restrictions that make it difficult for me to eat anywhere. Rather than eat inside and be disrespectful to the establishment I sat outside. I  was told that I can't eat my food there sure to health regulations OUTSIDE!  Not to mention there are dogs sitting outside!! whah!!  (i love dogs and really don't care) but just seems unfair to accommodate for patrons  so sad. :(
test_92,The food was great. The flavors seemed authentic. The food seemed to be made from good quality ingredients. I would definitely go back.
test_93,"I was new Pilates and was a little nervous as I have scioliosis  with rods. I found the facility very clean and attractive. Alexis, the owner, is an excellent instructor and very knowledgeable  taking extra care to address my limitations. As I became more proficient and confident, I notice significant improvement in my strength and comfort level. With scoliosis, core strength  and agility are severely compromised. Pilates addresses just that as well as overall strengthing. As a RN, I was impressed at Alexis' ability to evaluate and adjust movements  to accomodate  my limitations and focus on my unique issues. I find that I now have waist again and have the strength to hold myself  more upright  giving the appearance of regaining some of my lost height.  I probably have gained at least 1/2- 1 inch much to my delight. I find myself looking forward to my classes  for the  benefits and pleasant conversations.  
  Thanks, Alexis, for improving my life.

test_94,"When I first came to Perla, my hair was a mess from a previous stylist and had to be completely restyled and recut. She fixed the cut so perfectly and I got extensions and I've never had a better experience with anyone before. She's absolutely perfect!"
test_95,"I am ashamed to say that I just this week stopped in. I have heard rave reviews for the past 2 years, but I was also horrified by a story a friend  told me involving a supersoaker filled with urine and a drunk kid spraying patrons on NYE 2007. I think that being sprayed with urine from a supersoaker would ruine my life as i know it. Anyways, I love this place; it is NOT the sort of place that should scare you. The super soaker incident was clearly isolated and unfortunate. They even serve vegetarian chili. There is a decent beer selection and the cheap cans are only $1 from 6-9pm for happy hour. I feel awful that I have missed out on 2 years of patronage."
test_96,"Inedible food and incompetent service in a shiny 4-star toy on the lakeside waterfront ""100% corner"" in Madison.  After staying at the Edgewater for business over four days and dining at the Statehouse four times, this review applies to the front of house and the back.  Routinely, I was not acknowledged or offered water for more than 20 minutes even when indicating in advance that I was on my way to a meeting.  The food was not served to order (raw poached eggs, tough and over salted meats/fish, over sauced mystery fish, raw strawberry pie dough). At breakfast, I had to request my check FIVE times and was 20 minutes late to my meeting.  At the last meal (and why didn't I learn my lesson?), my salad and entr√©e were served at the same time, swimming in a mass of unidentifiable glop.  Servers are not trained/ knowledgeable about what they are selling/serving. I had requested fish similar to trout and got a fatty, oily, thick, tough, over-salted bottom feeder.  When I opened my napkin for silverware, there was a lone spoon inside and no fork so I couldn't eat it anyway - again after a 45 minute wait.  I sent it back and got a cheese plate. Go for the view and enjoy a drink, but prepare yourself to feel like the invisible guest.  I suggest all employees watch the film ""A Five Star Life"" (Italian with English subtitles) to get an idea of a luxury guest's expectations and the Statehouse's vast room for improvement."
test_97,"I cant believe what I brought back to work today from popeyes, OMG, 11 tiny shrimp were about the size of a nickle, 1 biscuit & a side of mash potato's. For 7 dollars and change. What a FFF rip off. I have pics to show. but I don't see a place to add them.

I will not grab food here again...................................
DONT EAT HERE!!!!!"
test_98,We had a huge feast! We opted for the half mixed grill plate that came with hummus & pita. What a great meal! The meat was well seasoned and don't get me started on the falafel! We had plenty of leftovers which our server happily packed up for us. All in all a delicious meal!!
test_99,"I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch at Terrace Pointe Cafe during a recent stay at the Wynn.  I'd dined here before years ago and remember the food being good, so I was happy to confirm once again that it is.  We were seated promptly in one of their nice, comfortable booths.  Though we were given water right away, it did take awhile for our waitress to come by to take our orders.  She did see frazzled and we had pretty slow service overall, but the food was good, so I can overlook the slow service a bit.

For lunch I had a lemonade and the chicken club wrap with fries.  I know it sounds ordinary, but honestly it was so good.  The lemonade was perfect and the wrap had gouda cheese that was awesome.  I don't know what it is, but I love it.  The Hubs had the BLT and also enjoyed it quite a bit.

It's pretty simple, if we are at the Wynn and want a nice, relatively inexpensive lunch, I would definitely consider Terrance Pointe Cafe.  I'd try to sit outside next time though, it's really lovely."
test_100,Service was prompt and polite. I had the chicken stew which was tender and delicious.  DH had the ox tail which was tender and full of flavor.  We left full and satisfied due to the rice and beans but the protein servings could be a little larger.   We also tried the Ducunu.  It was very tender and moist reminding me of a sweet corn tamale.
test_101,"I really like this place, and so does my family. I have only eaten in the restaurant once, and I can't really remember it but we almost always order takeout. Their pan-fried noodles are fantastic, especially when the noodles are extra crispy! Their pineaple chicken is so yummy, and the black bean shrimp is DELICIOUS!! Their fried rice is amazing, especially if you get the house fried rice with the pork in it. It also comes with 1 or 2 shrimp on the side. Really, really good. My Dad used to travel to China a lot with work, and says this place is as authentic as it gets in the area."
test_102,Dave was very nice and cooperative. We were a walk in and first time getting a tattoo. Felt very at ease and took his time to explain the process. By reading the other reviews all the negativity is about the owner and his rude behavior. But not Dave! I would def go back to him.
test_103,"I came here back in late January and my friend raved about this place so, our friends all decided to have takeout here. We're ordered crab Rangoon, pad Thai, pad kee Mao, yellow curry chicken, fried rice, etc. I had a taste of everything and I was sooooooo disappointed with everything. I'm from SF and thai food here is amazing!  I was really looking forward to eating this meal until I opened my box and the noodles were so different. It wasn't the wide flat noodles they serve in SF- it was thin flat noodles that were so bland that soy sauce didn't even help boost the flavor. The fried rice was nasty but the curry chicken was the best. I wished I had ordered that instead. The staff were nice enough to call us a cab and give us all the utensil and paper plates needed for our group. The restaurant was cleaned but at the hour of 5:00pm, there was no one dining there a all."
test_104,"Gorgeous nightclub with a beautiful pool in the back! I've been to XS and Hakkasan before but was underwhelmed by both, XS's dance floor was too small and Hakkasan was just way too packed and the decor was just whatever. Drai's definitely exceeded my expectations, it had awesome production effects with cold air blowing and confetti and dancers. The only thing that was annoying was getting in and out of the venue, it was kind of confusing. But that also could have been my fault since I didn't really know where I was going and just followed my friends.
Overall a great venue and the DJ was on point!"
test_105,"I love Korean food and have ate at a lot of Korean restaurants.. This is by far the worst Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is horrible, the service is just as bad. Server didn't know the difference between one soup from another. They charged a soup dish $10 bucks that would be free at any other Korean restaurant. No wonder the place was empty like a ghost town. Will never eat here again.."
test_106,"THANK GOD WE FINALLY HAVE A REAL COLORIST IN THIS TOWN!!  It took me years of suffering through unqualified, unprofessional, flaky people attempting to do color.(Im from NY)Charles is the only one capable of doing blondes in this town. He has opened the most chic and modern salon with an old warm charm you must check it out. He is so talented and very passionate about his work and his clients. The whole staff is lovely and the atmosphere is so warm and inviting. He gave me a very cute, trendy hair cut too! LOVE IT!!!"
test_107,"Bad service starting from the check-in desk.  They make you wait even though there were clerks standing not helping anyone.  When finally decided to call the next in line, they have such bad attitude and just don't want to spend one extra second with you.  The insulation is terrible in the room.  Being a time share, there were lots of kids staying there.  We could hear kids running all over on the floor above us and the screaming from next door.  The only pleasant person was the time share sales guy.  Thanks to the warning from others, we didn't take the bait. Even if you have to pay more, it's worth it stay away from this place!"
test_108,"Service was great! Beer priced very well if you are okay with domestics! Had the pretzel which was awesome!! The cheese was not what I expected but good but the honey mustard was excellent! The atmosphere is definitely 'club' scene. The music was extremely loud and I'm not sure anyone is drunk enough for that volume of chaos at 4pm... but all that said, I would go back and hang out at the tables in the street and people watch!"
test_109,"SoCal/Mexican eats on the Danforth? Now this is a much-needed addition to my 'hood. The Danforth is obviously filled with Greek restaurants, but those who don't know the area as well may not realize that we've got a wide variety of other cuisines as well, from Thai to Italian to Chinese to Japanese...and now some Southern-California-style Mexican food! I didn't even realize how much we were missing it, but now I don't know how we went on so long without it!

I had the delicious Chipotle Pulled Chicken Burrito (served with guacamole, win!) with a side coleslaw. As some other reviewers have noted, the slaw was definitely on the vinegary/peppery side, but I thought it complemented the dish really well. My boyfriend had the Veggie Fritter Tacos which I stole a bite of and enjoyed, too. We started the meal off with a plate of taquitos - a dish I'd somehow never tried before! Basically, they're a Mexican version of spring rolls, filled with potatoes and other goodies and deep-fried. Um, yum.

Service was friendly and prompt - definitely still signs that they're a new restaurant and super eager to please. I'll be back when I need a break from my other Danforth standards...and I need to try a mojito next time, and some dessert!"
test_110,"This Tim's is conveniently located for those working or going to school at OISE. Other than location, there's not much good to say. The lineups are always huge here, with little effort from staff/management to move things along. The last time I was here, my ice cap was not properly mixed, and spilling out the top. My donut was mostly melted after just 1 minute in the bag. Probably won't be back - this isn't the Tim Horton's I know and love."

Very cool guys and very professional and knowledgeable of their product! They done a great job in my Chuck looks amazing! It rides smoother than the factory suspension and looks great as well! The Fox suspension that came with the  Cognito lift made a huge difference! I also opted to do a bedcover and AMP research electric steps!

test_114,"I came here because of a cat with special dietary needs--the food selection at Petco/Petsmart just wasn't cutting it anymore. Wow, does ATYS ever have a huge selection! It was a little overwhelming really, but one of the employees (also a vet student) listened to what I was looking for in a food and helped point me to a few brands/varieties that fit the bill. 

Helpful, reasonable prices, knowledgeable staff. Yep, this is my new pet store!"
test_115,"Been here for lunch a few times.  Today was exceptionally disappointing.  We asked to be seated in a location with a little more privacy, suggesting a table.  After the hostess seats us, we wait for 5 mins while servers buzz around all the other tables.  My friend decides to go up to the hostess area to let them know we'd actually like to get served in this century.

We order the 'Bottomless Soup & Salad'.  It comes with bland tortilla chips & some decent pureed salsa.  The tortilla & baked potato soups are cream based, so it's pretty rich.  The house salads are ok but nothing to brag about.  

The best thing about this place was our assigned server Jeff.  He was extremely apologetic about the 'rocky start' as he called it.  Our food came out within minutes of placing our order & I think he checked on us @ least 6 times.  We really appreciated his effort despite the food quality."
test_116,"I like these type of restaurants. You pick your dish, ingredients, sit down and wait for them to get it for you. Not bad. 

For a sunday afternoon, this place was dead. 
The interior has a 50s style and, mostly likely, Ikea furnishings is what you'll find inside. Lots of white with solid colors and a stone wall. 

It's a great idea. $7.77 for a sizable salad, 5 free ingredients after lettuce and $2 for steak, salmon or shrimp. I got salmon, a small piece but  reasonable for $2!
They also have pastas and pizza.

No changing table in their large, one person, bathrooms."
test_117,"This place is always chaotic.  Super super super busy, but that's because it's really fun!  As a girl, I know a lot of girls wouldn't be comfortable or have fun golfing at a ""driving range,"" but that's why Top Golf is so great, because even if you don't want to play, you can just hangout and eat/drink with your friends who are playing.  Whether you're coming here for a date, birthday party, in a big group, or whatever it may be, this place is great for people of all ages.  The atmosphere itself is really fun and it's just a super cool idea that's entertaining."
test_118,"I love this store. It's decorated with Disney characters and a screen in the back showing Disney clips.

This is the ONLY Disney Store in Western PA left! There used to be a Disney store at every mall. I like it but it seems like it could have more stuff in it.

They have toys, costumes, collectibles, ornaments and movies. A must visit for any Disney fan!"
test_119,"It always seems to amaze me coming to this location! 
I love filibertos and this location is around the corner from where I live however it offers the slowest service ever! On average when I go through the drive thru it takes  anywhere from 10-20 minutes absolutely unacceptable. At times there is only 2 cars in front of me or less and the wait is horrible. I really do not recommend this location at all. I order bean and cheese burritos and I swear every time I get them they get smaller and smaller for a 5 year old child. The tortilla is crunchy or burnt half the time but I give the the opportunity to prove me wrong and some times they do a great job but most of the time they fail!"
test_120,"This is definitely my new favorite airport restaurant! I ordered a farmhouse salad & Scottish smoked salmon tapas plate, along with a 3oz pour of Sauvignon Blanc just to have something to sip on. The farmhouse salad was refreshing & light, but with punches of flavor from the goat cheese & crunchy texture from the pumpkin seeds. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the beet spirals in the salad -- it would have been awesome to have roasted beet chunks instead, but w/e, just a minor detail. 

I really loved the smoked salmon tapas, which came with 4 rosettes of salmon, each with 2-3 slices of salmon rolled up & bits of capers, onions, & microgreens, all dressed with some creme fraiche & a light white sauce. There was plenty of flat bread to stack the salmon onto, it's so nice when a restaurant provides you with adequate bread/crackers! 

I guess the prices are a bit expensive, but considering that a mediocre & skimpy smoked salmon bagel might cost $13 in your typical airport, I'd much rather spend a couple dollars more to eat a high quality meal at Beaudevin. I'm counting down the days to when I fly back home from my business trip, so I can make another trip to Beaudevin & try the flight of NC wines!"
test_121,"I'm a South Indian and I live in Toronto. I was in St Jean for 8 weeks and was dying to get a taste of home. My friend recommended Thanjai restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed the food offered at this place and left with a big smile on my face. 
I had:
Sambar Vada 
Masala Dosa
Gulab Jamun

This all costed around 17$ which is an amazing deal. The food quality is top notch and if you are a South Indian looking for some food in Montreal, this place is as authentic as your local dosa joint in Chennai. 

I also took one of my buddies who's of Caucasian descent m. He was initially worried about the spice as he'd never eaten Indian food before. His verdict was that the food was very well balanced, savoury and not at all spicy. So if you're anxious about dabbling into the Indian cuisine, don't worry, this place isn't going to set your mouth on fire. 

The quantity of food is also very reasonable at this place. The only thing I would advise you to do is to make a reservation. I spent the day in Montreal and reserved a seat, in advance, on their website and boy was I glad. The place isn't very big and seems to attract a lot of people so do beware that if you don't reserve, you may end up waiting upwards of 20 minutes.

PS: this is my first review."
test_122,This place is a GEM in an otherwise boring strip. I am so so happy that it's here! Everything I've ever had there has been tasty and seems like it's made with care. There is wifi and nice large tables for studying. I really hope this business can thrive.
test_123,"We got to your establishment at 6:30pm 11/18/15. The waitress we had really didn't wait us. Never asked how we were doing. Never asked if we needed anything. Someone else brought out our food. I had gotten the chicken parm sliders. There was like no sauce on it. The chicken was dry. Both plates were hot but food was cold. My bf asked for no tomato. You could tell that someone had put it on and took it off because the juices and seeds was on his burger. Couldn't asked for sauce she didn't come back except when she gave us our bill. She was way friendlier to the other tables around us but not to us. Idk. Couldn't tell you her name. She didn't say. We basically sat in the back corner at a round table. I was there bout a month ago and had great food and service thought I would come back because I wanted my bf to experience it but it sucked. What sucked even more he drives an hr to see and then I actually live an hr away from your restaurant. So waste of my money, time, and gas."
test_124,"The least helpful employees I've ever encountered. Apparently something had happened with a guy who was leaving as I was entering, however, when I approached the door the three employees standing blocking the doorway didn't open the door or greet me, they simply stared at me until I was directly in front of them and then wandered off without a word. Not one of the 6 employees standing around inside bothered to help me find what I was looking for, either. I never did find what I was looking for, or anything comparable. Left empty handed, and will not be returning."
test_125,"I was looking for reviews and I saw how bad the general reviews for Chinatown were... it isn't bad! 

It is a Chinese buffet!! They have a lot of sushi! and by diner they have steaks!!!

They have a wide range of things to eat and they are the one with the most variety in town."
test_126,Have been going to this drive thru for years and always had exceptional service and the people were extremely friendly.  The last few times I stopped in to purchase a few small things and lottery tickets the older lady that waited on me was very rude and short.  She seemed to get upset when I asked for the lottery tickets.  They were not busy and there was no one in line behind me.  She acted as though it was a burden for her to print the tickets.  Based on her attitude my wife and I will no longer be patronizing this establishment.  Sadly the location is in close proximity to our home and made it very convenient but we choose not to deal with the rudeness as we can spend our money elsewhere and be treated much better.
test_127,"We just got back from Ryu Sushi and Teppanyaki, we had a great night there. The service was great! Our server was so sweet and the food was delicious. I recommend the filet mignon. We will definitely be back."
test_128,"Probably the best overall value for anyone looking to stay close to the strip and stay in a suite.  The rooms are incredible.  Feels like being at home and then some.  The staff is very nice and attentive.  If your budget is within $230/night or more, you really need to look at this place because it is very much worth it.  This will always be top of the list when looking for places to stay in Vegas now."
test_129,"If your looking for some legit street tacos Taco y Taco is spot to be. Although when we arrived we weren't sure where to line up because there are different stations. They should put some signs up for first timers. 

I ended up getting 3 tacos the Al pastor and 2 lengua tacos. The Al pastor taco was okay not my favorite. However, they have the best Mexican style corn. I highly recommend trying it if you want some legit Mexican corn."
test_130,"For someone who lives in a studio and can only cook in the microwave, on the George Foreman and well...that's basically it, Trader Joe's has been a life saver.  A great experience every time I go.  No matter what day or time, there seems to always be something new to sample.  Chunky brownie pieces sprinkled with sea salt? Would have never thought to try, but ended up buying a whole packet.  Frozen meal section is wonderful--love the crab cake cakes and already seasoned and stuffed fish fillets.  Very reasonable prices for my student budget and I've noticed that I've been slimming down as well.  Good bye Senior 30!"
test_131,"I came here for the first time today and honestly I'm shook. The food was so good. We shared biscuits and gravy, Mac n' cheese, and the chicken and waffles. Not one thing was bad! The Mac and cheese was creamy, crunchy and cheesy. The chicken was juicy, crunchy and satisfying. I never write reviews but the outstanding service and food made me think it would be disrespectful not too. They work hard to make sure you enjoy your food and I'm grateful that they are opening one in LA!! I'll be impatiently waiting! Thank you!"
test_132,"I'm excited that a gluten free restaurant/bakery is in my neighborhood and has easy parking. The menu looks great and the food plates I saw looked amazing. I've only been there three times. Twice to meet a friend for coffee and once to get take out pastries which were amazing.

The actual experience was not so great. Since it is a new place, the staff should be a little more inviting. When you walk in the door for the first time, it's hard to tell if you are to seat yourself and a server comes over or if you are to get in line (and which side of the counter because there were people on both sides and cutting in front of people in the other line). The three times I went there were no greetings or acknowledgement from the staff-even if they saw us come in. I thought that was a little rude. Not a good first, second or third impression for a business that just opened in a community.

I will have to try the food sometime when they have had a chance to get their staff trained on common courtesy and customer service. 

I always hate it when I either go to a place and love the food, but the experience was bad or if I hate the food, but the staff, experience and decor is cool."
test_133,"I had lost all hope for meeting any friendly people in Henderson until I met Soph at Kyklos. Soph is so warm and personable, couldn't help but purchase from Soph. I had the chicken gyro. Wonderful. The meat is seasoned to perfection. There is enough food for leftovers. Love how Soph offers you a sample with such enthusiasm with every potential customer. I highly recommend eating here. The food is great and Soph is wonderful."
test_134,"We are from back East & this is the closest thing to home! Real deli, great selections and all the Italian desserts we love. Highly reccomend the crab cake Benedict since I am from Maryland, they use Blue crab & no fillers."
test_135,"We love this rec center. The fitness center is great, clean and has great equipment.  The hours and prices are great too. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I also love that it isn't your typical over crowded gym which is not my thing. We've also used one of the rooms for a baby shower and that worked out well and again the staff was great and so helpful. Tot town is a great bonus as well."
test_136,This place was AMAZING! I stumbled upon this place because it's near the Cold Stone by my house  thought we'd try it for dinner tonight. It's my new fave Thai food place in Vegas. The food was so good and the service was great. The price was right too. 2 meals and 2 apps for 39$ (and they were shrimp meals) definitely gonna go again.
test_137,"My initial comments were based on delivery to my home. Since then, I have dined in the restaurant.  There is SO much that is good about this place. It starts with the homemade noodles; they have what Italian cooks call great ""tooth feel,"" meaning the homemade texture stands out and highlights the sauces.  For the Dry Noodle and soup dishes, you will have a choice of thin or wide noodles. I prefer the latter with sauces and thin noodles with soup.  A number of Dry Noodle dishes use an authentic Chinese sesame sauce, which is less creamy than mid-Eastern tahini sauces. Toss, give the sauce time to coat the noodles and you'll like it. 

The soup dumplings are delicious; the veggie dumplings are good but a little bland.  Ask for shredded ginger and chili sauce to spice things ups.  From the Dim Sum menu, try the Pan Fried Onion Pancakes with Sliced Beef which are impossibly good. Many of the appetizers are palate refreshing, like the pickled cucumber and five spiced eggplant. There are four selections using rice. I have tried and liked Braised Beef over rice, which has a tasty gravy, infused with Chinese five-spices seasoning. 

Finally, this restaurant offers real value to its customers.  Most dishes are under $10.00.  You easily get four dishes, which is enough to feed 3-4 people, for under $40.00."
test_138,"Was out and about and decided that I needed some protein, fast!  Stopped by here and went inside and ordered a 12 piece Chick-Fil-A nuggets.  Was helped by a nice young gentleman named Timothy (Best name ever, lol!).  Had my order of nuggets in literally 30 seconds.  Grabbed some napkins and Buffalo sauce and headed out to my car.

The nuggets were great as usual.  12 bite sized pieces of goodness.  When is Chick-Fil-A not good?  Their nuggets are perfect!  Breaded perfect, great crunch, moist in the middle etc.  Can't think of a better chicken nugget out there.  Their Buffalo sauce is tangy and makes a good dipping sauce.  

Friendly service, great food (as always) and consistency will always keep me coming back to Chick-Fil-A.  I even scored a free chicken sandwich coupon for doing their online survey.  I love when my receipt has one of those on it ;-).  Good times!  If I'm ever on the 10 and want some tasty chicken nuggets, I know where to come."
test_139,"PINK CHERRY WAX is the BEST!! 
I was going to EWC for a while but I was never 100% happy with them- after A LOT of searching and reviews I decided to give them a try- I got my eyebrows done by Shaina and absolutely loved them so my next appointment, I added a Brazilian. Consider me a loyal customer :) 
The spa is SO cute and all the girls are so nice!"
test_140,"Food average,  processed. Bartenders terrible security awful all around bad experience would not recommend to no one now there cooking off a food trailer and taking it inside the worst by far"
test_141,"Had a great experience. I needed x-rays, and found out that Simon Med did walk ins for x-ray. Front desk personnel checked me in and gave me an estimated time of about an hour. 1/2 hour later was getting scanned by Debbie. Very pleasant experience and Debbie kept me at ease."
test_142,"I can't say that I like the loft. I mean they have TV's and a projector with a big screen and their beer offerings were not bad but I didn't like the way that they do food. 

By that I mean they don't have food. In a strange turn of events they allow you to order  from D's Six Packs and Dogs which is cool but they pretty much just allow you to eat it in the loft. I  find it kind of useless to have to go to another bar to get food just to bring it to another bar to eat it. I mean it's right below the restaurant couldn't they like go and get it and then just add it your tab or something. I guess not. 

I think the only reason you would want to go here is if you can't get into D's."
test_143,"15 min wait.  They send you a text saying that you are on the list and you can check your status there.  If you're not waiting inside they text you.

We sat near the window.  Like this spot.  It's very loud but you're also on a Main Street so there's lots of tourists and walk in traffic.  It was really busy at 7pm on a Tuesday.

Music videos playing was fun.  Music was actually at a perfect level so you don't have to scream when speaking to people at your table.  

Waited a bit for service but it is also super busy, so understandable.  Waiter came, didn't rush us.  Drinks came really quick.  Rather than drop them and run he stayed to take our order.  Food was lacking in flavour and freshness."
test_144,"Element is a good hotel - part of the SPG group.  Very close to YYZ (if you're doing business / seeing family north of the city - a good choice.......I live in the GTA, and, was at a Wedding up here).
First impression - walked-in to a nice open lobby, and, was nicely greeted by the Front Desk.  
Now.....at 3:30pm in the afternoon......not having any rooms ready??  Come on.  We had a Wedding to get ready for, and, my wife used the Lobby washroom to start.  They recovered quickly.  We had a room within 15 minutes.  
The hotel is still new, and, working out some kinks I believe. 
Gorgeous room.  L-Couch (comfy), small kitchenette, big windows, and, a rainfall shower.  If I was out of town travelling for business, I would be VERY happy with a room like this to return to.  Much better than a standard hotel room.
Recommended."
test_145,"Stopped in this morning to see grab a couple of treats for brunch at home. Hadn't really heard much about this place and was pleasantly surprised by what I found. 
The staff that greeted me were friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I ended up ordering a rosemary white chocolate scone and a shortbread cinnamon bun along with two lattes. 
The rosemary scone was perfect. The rosemary and white chocolate created a flavour combo that I never would have thought of but was delectable. 
The shortbread cinnamon bun was amazing and threw a nice twist on the boring cinnamon bun that you find at other restaurants. 
Checked out the menu while there and everything looked amazing. I will be heading there again soon to try some of the meals!!"
test_146,"I have been going here for years and it is definitely my go to sandwich shop. The service is quick and friendly. The sandwiches which have changed over the years still can be ordered to perfection if you know what to ask for.

An all-american overstuffed with cukes and sprouts is my top sandwich. All the sandwiches used to come with sprouts and cukes by default forcing you to try something you probably would not do otherwise. I wish they still did because
they definitely make it better.

 I tend to stay away from the soup because it is too expensive for the size and while
I love the chili the rest seem to be ho-hum compared to the god of soups( Subs By Jim r.i.p).  Every now and then they cater to our work and I get to sample the delights like the lady bug club or the charlie brown. All of their sandwiches are delicous and highly recommended."
test_147,"came here since we were staying at the Venetian and they had OpenTable availability for our party haha. overall the experience at Casanova wasn't bad and the restaurant served its purpose for our dinner needs haha. it's located near the Grand Canal shoppes food court area so it was a bit hard to find. we were seated right away and i ordered the fettucine with meat sauce dish ($17) since i wanted something hearty to prepare for that night's festivities haha. the dish was pretty good and a generous portion. but our service really wasn't that great...our server would disappear for extended periods of time where he was nowhere to be seen in the dining room area (and its not that big of a space haha). just took longer than it needed to just to ask for anything whether it was drink refills, a to-go box, or our check. i mean if you need a semi-affordable, sit-down restaurant option, Casanova isn't bad...but just dont expect too much haha"
test_148,"This place is amazing and we were so surprised to find it in Phoenix of all places. Scramble offers many breakfast and lunch options for vegan, vegetarians and regular meat eating folks.

I decided to try one of the vegan options: a spinach, mushroom and sun dried tomato tofu scramble with sweet potato hash and rye toast. I also got a soy mocha and an OJ. Everything was brilliant and the coffee was the best one I've had in the US so far. I struggled to finish but made sure I stuck at it until I did.

Food service was prompt and customer service not bad either. The server pointed out a few touristy places nearby for us to look at and was pretty friendly. The outdoor seating was nice and the had a good mountain view. 

The server advised us they were looking to expand into other locations in the near future. My vote is for New York, hope to see you here Scramble :D"
test_149,"Hotpot! Hotpot! Hotpot! That's all I wanted at that moment. We came here on Sunday night for dinner. It wasn't too busy as most tables were empty. As many have mentioned, this place is pretty small but cozy. We sat on a table for four and our waiter was pretty attentive.  We ordered three hotpots with the two types of meat ($16.95) with the herbal broth. I got lamb and beef which was really yummy! Service was fast as we each got individual pots and a bowl of assorted things which included: cabbage, noodles, tofu, fish ball, mushrooms, an egg, etc. (Keep in mind that it was one piece per item). I actually liked this because it gave you an opportunity to taste a bit of everything! The broth was delicious and they keep refilling as you eat. I do have to say though, the sample platter was small but you can order additional things if you want.

Remember to check in through yelp! You get a pot of tea for free which is better than tap water. I wanted to try their other dishes as everything looked so delicious! In addition,  they gave us very small bite size dessert for free!! They also had a sale of bubble tea which was buy one get one free. One of the cons was that there were too many flies which kept bugging me throughout the meal."
test_150,"If you enjoy waiting, to have your plasma drawn, then this is your place. Staff in bay 1 unable to track people, they enjoy talking about people, and seem pissed that your there."
test_151,Sooooooo stupidly slow! Get it together SS...you've been open too long to still be so discombobulated. And the app STILL has an 1+ hour wait.kinda defeats the purpose of app ordering.
test_152,"By The Slice is one of the best pizza places I been to.  It is a small place nicely tucked away in the plaza.  I order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers.  They always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16.99 - Their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. Southwest chicken and Meat combo are my fave.  If you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 Medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  Ex-Large Margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  They surpising also have amazing fried chicken almost like KFC.  I actually like it more than KFC and it is cheaper as well.  10 huge Chicken pieces and medium wedges for only $12.99.  Only thing bad is the plaza parking is horrible as it shared with Wendy's, starbucks,Kelsey and Mr. Greek.  Can't wait to order from them this Friday."
test_153,"Yesterday (8/25/16) my truck overheated on the 101 freeway. And luckily a police officer was nearby and offered to push me to a safe nearby location off the freeway. At about 8:20am in the morning I called Discount Towing, and they were able to arrive in less than 20 minutes from the call. From there, they were able to take me and my truck to my favorite auto shop. Their service was quick and professional, and price was very reasonable. I would highly recommend their services to anyone looking to get out of tough jam. Thanks again Bob & Linda!!"
test_154,"Tried a new breakfast place with the family.  The food was all good.  We ordered a large variety.  The staff is friendly and attentive. This is not a big fancy place, but if you are looking for good, wholesome food this is your place. As a note, they have Mexican breakfast items too."
test_155,"The day after a holiday weekend (Memorial Day), I have a slow leak and a busy day.  I go in to them in the morning and they are of course booked all day.  But they squeeze me in, put on my spare, mark the hole in the tire, and don't charge me a dime.  All in a short period of time.  Super nice of them."
test_156,I really love this place. The shawarma is SO delicious! The food is flavorful and I haven't tried anything I haven't liked.
test_157,"I recently purchased my wedding dress at this location and received exceptional customer service. I'd highly recommend any bride visit Kathy in the bridal suite to see the selection of gowns. I also recommend working with Maria in alterations, as she made my dress fit like a glove! I truly could not be more happy with my experience."
test_158,"After having a bad experience with another nail salon in the area, I went based on the reviews.  This is the cutest little pedicure boutique!! They offer lots of beautiful colors, so many that you get confused and you want all of them. The ladies in the salon were extremely friendly, made you feel very welcome and great conversation. I am very picky with my nails and I made it very clear to the ladies about it-the great thing was the nail lady was extremely confident that she was going to be able to make me happy. I was lucky enough to get the lady Allie to do my dip nails with a tip and she did an amazing job and I couldn't be more happy with the finished product. 
The Seating areas are very comfortable and relaxing! 
Her pedicure was amazing, very clean and great attention to detail which is hard to find these days!
If you want to great job give her a call you won't be disappointed (623) 628-8808
Thank you Allie..."
test_159,"I've never walked out of there not feeling like a million bucks! Customer service is on point. Fair prices, excellent cuts"
test_160,"We arrived at 1:00 PM. They were open until 2:00.

Serving staff seemed to be in back room most of the time.

My daughter Ordered bowl of red chili
I ordered bowl of pork chili verde
My granddaughter ordered Kale salad - specifically because it would be gluten free, with the blueberries and the avocado on the side because she did not want them but was giving them to me. She also added chicken.

My daughter received red chili too extremely spicy for any of us to eat
My granddaughter received a salad in a fried flour tortilla shell with no kale in it, her added chicken was put on the side - my granddaughter said she couldn't eat the chicken because it wasn't completely cooked and was still ""squishy""

The blueberries, which came to me, were mostly very over ripe, and spoiling. Some were even moldy. After trying to pick through them, I just gave up on eating any

The pork chili verde which I received had skin of some sort in it, but otherwise seemed to be okay though it tasted unlike anything I had ever had, but later I got horribly ill with extreme, painful intestinal cramping, diarrhea, and chills.

When we asked where was the kale in my granddaughter's kale salad, we were told that they had discontinued that salad so they just gave us something else. They seemed offended that we objected and expected to receive what we ordered. They even asked what was wrong with the salad they had brought us! Specifically, they said, ""Is there something WRONG with the salad we brought you?""

When my daughter said she wanted the salad taken off the bill they acted offended.

They began sweeping the floor near us and putting the chairs up on the tables while we were still eating.

I am not sure why ANYONE would like this place. The only thing it has going is location and that is simply not enough - not for me."
test_161,"I really hate having to write poor reviews for good people, but I must. 

I came in on 12/29 and ordered a creme brulee coffee after seeing a commercial for it and thinking ""that sounds freaking fantastic"". 

So. After waiting for 10 minutes in the drive thru to order, the menu was not clear and which coffee was the special flavor. I asked and was not given a specific answer, so I ordered the flavor with an iced latte. I get to the window and the guys are really nice, told me about the medium size that was cheaper than the small I got and I upgraded. However, the coffee I got was just a regular iced coffee. It tasted fine, but after repeating and asking if it was the creme brulee flavor, I was let down. I never got a receipt so instead of being able to take an online survey I called and talked to a manager. Before he got on the phone he was telling the employee who answered the phone that he couldn't do anything about it but he'll talk to me. How generous. 

I told him what happened and he tried to reason that the deal I got was a better price than what I got, which I wasn't squabbling over price. I just wanted to try the seasonal flavor they were offering. He told me if I came back in he'd make it right. I decided to give them another try and waited another 5 minutes for him to come out of where he was only to be met with an expression of confusion. He made me a small creme brulee coffee and it was so gross... There was nothing in that coffee that even hinted at caramelized sugar. It tasted like burnt, sour coffee from the previous day. So gross I had to toss it after a few sips.

I hate to say it, but I'm done with this location. The people are very nice, but the donuts are shoddily decorated, the coffee is disgusting, the dining area is full of ripped chairs and wobbly tables, and I'm tired of wasting my time and money here."
test_162,"I have been going to Michelle for spray tans for about two years now and will never go to anyone else. I even tried going to the Charles Scott, Westlake location and got totally botched. 
With Michelle, ‚Äãmy tan is even, lasts for more than 10 days, and fades very nicely. Highly recommend!"
test_163,"We went during restaurant week with large group. They just recently opened and we were unsure how things would turn out. 
We should not have feared. All dishes that came out were well presented and flavorful. 
Similarly service was attentive and corrected mistakes quickly. 
We also sampled many drinks and wines and walked away similarly impressed. 
Definitely a spot worth revisiting."
test_164,"The food here is so delicious! It's definitely a treat yo self spot where you can indulge and walk out happy and in a food coma.

Came here with a group of girlfriends and we ordered a few things to share. Everything is definitely shareable if you are with a group and want to try a couple of things. I'd recommend making a reservation for a larger group, especially if you're going during peak dinner hours.

We had the deviled eggs, chicken and watermelon waffles, cornbread, and fried chicken.

The fried chicken was delicious - perfectly crispy and juicy and flavorful inside. The chicken and watermelon waffles were good as well but I wouldn't say the combination with watermelon was my favorite. The cornbread was soft, sweet and so good with some of their maple butter. 

It's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get but worth it for a special night and to to get some yummy southern cookin'"
test_165,"The staff at Davis Funeral Home at 1401 S Rainbow were very compassionate and understanding, they helped with the arrangements for my daughter. They made a difficult time in my life a little easier. All the staff was wonderful but Mike Roberts was awesome, no matter how many questions and concerns I had for him he was always there for me and my family."
test_166,"Coconut chocolate chunk is amazing. Peppermint chip also rocks. They aren't kidding with their use of chocolate pieces. The ice cream is high quality and they do have some interesting flavors. I'm a big fan of Ben and Jerry's, but if you are looking for something a little simpler, this is a good option. There are plenty of tables (and benches outside) to hang out here, or you can grab a pint to go. It does get very busy in the summer, but the line moves quickly. If it were a bit less expensive, I would give it 5 stars. 

By the way, last time I checked you can find Mitchell's at the nearby Heinens as well."
test_167,"The best fries in Alberta, hands down!

Not only that, but a warm, inviting room, a multitude of foreign beers on tap, an outstanding wine selection, and food that will get your taste buds hoping. The Brasserie is one of the best, tucked-away pubs in Kensington.

Came here for lunch on a quiet Friday afternoon. Had the club sandwich, which was delicious - and their fries, which were absolutely to die for.

They have Grolsch on tap, which is pretty awesome, and the servers were terrific, taking time to explain the menu and keep our bevvies topped up. 

I will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Calgary"
test_168,"Let's get the good out of the way before getting into this 1 star. Food good, beer? Great. 

Ok. Now service. We've never been so insulted at a brewpub. Our tab was $46, with taxes. I threw $5 on for tip. Our waiter, who came by once to get our first order, 2nd to bring food (2 bowls of soup), and 3rd to bring next round, proceeded to tell us that we did not tip enough. Seriously?! This entitled millennial is griping over $1!!! Not to mention this joker was on his phone and drinking beer behind the bar! Just looking at some of the other reviews on here, I'm not surprised with this behaviour! It really is too bad. We sat there tonight really enjoying the beer and said we'd come back tomorrow. Not now!!! We'll give our money and justified tips to other establishments in this city. This was embarrassing and deflated our evening! Perhaps get the hardworking staff in the back to run front of house; the condescending tool you had out front tonight was an elitist twit that will turn away customers!"
test_169,"Holy Bloody Mary! Bacon... in my Sunday brunch DRINK?!! Yah, I'm hooked, FOREVER! What better way to start your day. Bacon in my drink, pork belly appetizer and bacon WITH my food. Great food, great service and awesome atmosphere.. (side note) make reservations if you don't want to sit at the bar - we were unaware that this would be necessary, however we opted to sit at the bar. We'll know better next time"
test_170,"This has gone from being the best Starbucks in Las Vegas to one of the worst. 

The service tends to be on the rude side these days. 

They close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8. 

There is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

My last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee. 

There is no such thing as half n half here. 

It's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you. 

It's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready. 

There is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs. 

Also remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient? 

The parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.  

These days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10."
test_171,Bought sandwiches here and ask for extra pickles they give me 5 pieces of pickles extra.
test_172,Nice and cute cafe in the Finch area. Visited the place with friends a few days ago and had desserts - chocolate oreo parfait and araganto.. Both were nice..
test_173,"Suzi is is amazing, she is doing more than massage she is changing lives. Since going to Zingara my life and chronic pain issues, have changed so much I feel like a different person. If you are looking to improve your health, deal with chronic pain and just get some relief from overused tight muscles, then Zingara is the place for you!!"
test_174,One of the best burgers I've had! Staff was so nice and helpful. I will definitely be back to try some of the more authentic items on the menu.
test_175,"4 stars for the novel Topgolf experience, 5 stars for the awesome service we received for a unique/slightly awkward situation!

If your only experience with golfing is mini-golf.....have no fear! I had NEVER so much as held a proper golf club before and I had an awesome time here acquiring a new skill (the fact that drinks are served here didn't hurt, either!)

I should say...you DO have to get over the inevitable crowd of wandering eyes from neighboring booths as you try to perfect your clearly-my-first-time-golfing swing. Once you get over the stage fright and you actually hit a couple balls, you realize why so many people enjoy golf :) 

My group of 5 were having a great time when one of the waitresses came to clear our table of drinks and spilled her entire tray onto the floor, getting shards of glass all over our sandals and flip flops. It was cleaned up very efficiently, but not before we realized my boyfriend had a small cut on his ankle from the glass. Not a huge deal, but it was definitely alarming to see blood, and we were running out of playing time!

Because of this debacle, we had to rush through the last few minutes of our time to complete our second game. Luckily, we were later approached by management; they offered to refund all of our payments made towards playing time and memberships, AND offered us a round of drinks at the bar on the house. 

5 thumbs up for going above and beyond to make sure customers are happy. I would definitely return to Topgolf, if I ever happen to be near one in the future!"
test_176,"""I cannot wait to move!!!! The issue isn't the property as much as its with the management here. The rents are on par with nicer communities. Save your money and your time, lease anywhere but here. I would leave a 17 paragraph review but everyone covered the issues already. The one thing that annoyed me more then anything was when I had to pick up a package from the office, I waited 45 minutes because they rather talk in the back then work at the desk, after calling 14 times (I was standing in the office) they did not stop talking once to answer the phone. I also enjoy the drag races late at night and the super ""cool"" guy with the loud a$$ Porsche that loves to go 45 in the parking lot. RUN!""

This was my previous review.... I was contacted by upper management and was treated like I mattered. When I told them what has happened they stopped listened and reacted. Since the conversation on-site management has changed and is a ton better. As you can see I gave it 3 stars due to the price per quality, don't get me wrong it is nice but the prices are on the same level as a few nicer communities in the area. I would recommend checking it out, it might be something you would consider."
test_177,"On a Friday night when you don't feel like going out but you don't feel like cooking either, get Red Devil take-out!

Red Devil offers your standard italian fare - pizza, pasta, calzones. Boyfriend and I settled on sausage pizza, BBQ wings and an order of fried zucchini and mushrooms for out Friday night take-out pig-out. 

The pizza is good - lot of toppings and cheese. You can get ricotta cheese too for some extra yum. The wings were pretty good. We were hoping for more of a honey BBQ type wing but these are more like a spicy BBQ wing - good just not really what we were hoping for. And the fried zucchini and mushrooms were tasty, but really how could they not be?

We had leftover pizza and honestly it was even better the next day so make sure you get enough for leftovers!

The one downside was the price - it ain't cheap. For those three items our order was over $30. For an occasional take-out treat however, it's worth it."
test_178,Perfect sushi experience. Sashimi excellent. Iron noodle soup perfect. Definitely coming back!
test_179,"Prior to Sunnyslope's Art Walk, I decided a drink was in order.  After all, what's the point of walking without drinking.  Otherwise, I would be driving the Art Walk and then they would have to change the name to Art Drive and no one would go.  So Central Grille with it's generous parking fit the bill.

We sat on the patio which is quite nice, once the table with the screaming brat exited.  By then, I really needed that drink.  They have a great happy hour with $5 glasses of house wine, $3.50 well drinks and import or draft beer.  The house wines were not appealing to me, but all of their wine prices are quite reasonable, although the by-the-glass selection is limited.

We ordered two appetizers at only $5 each.  However, they were small, so definitely order more than one unless you're the girl that never eats in front of your guy.  I'm not that girl.  We had the artisan cheese plate and the fig jam crostini.  The cheese plate included a blue cheese, a goat cheese, and a third soft cheese (some kind of cream cheese).  The cranberry-walnut bread was a nice touch, even if the cheeses were somewhat ordinary.  The fig jam crostini was so crazy delicious though with carmelized onion and melted gorgonzola as well.

My husband wanted dinner, but since I didn't think there would be sofas along the art walk, we opted to have only an entree, no side dishes.  I went with the stuffed salmon.  The stuffing was made with crab meat.  Unfortunately, the salmon was undercooked around the stuffing.  Had I been resting after dinner instead of walking, I might have actually sent it back, something I rarely do.

The happy hour portion of service was actually a little slow considering the restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, but our server was friendly.  All in all, an enjoyable time."
test_180,The best food ever ! The grilled octopus is so tender and has a secret ingredient in it ! The chicken is so flavourful and fresh ! A must try
test_181,I am by far very disappointed from this place. I purchased a mattress it was defective they sent me the same style again defective they switched it out with a Serta that was not comfortable now mind you they have a 120 day love it or exchange I called that next few days after they said they are no longer getting serta mattresses to wait on new styles coming in. I waited for a couple months. Labor Day weekend I go in and they are in the new mattresses and I pick one out and Steve the manager said he will get back to me and till this day no one has and I have this uncomfortable mattress I sleep on and at very upset no one has called me to resolve this. I deserve a call back. Yes we can do this for your or no we cannot. Not just silence. That is not how you treat people.
test_182,"Food: 4.5 stars.  Service: 2.5 stars.  Excellent food, decor and presentation.  Seafood panang curry includes jumbo shrimp, oysters, scallops and squid; it does not come with enough rice though for the curry.  Mediocre service.  I really want to give this place 4-5 stars, but the long wait (even on a busy Saturday night) ruins the whole dining experience for hungry people.  We had to wait 45min for our seafood panang curry and pad thai while the table next to us that seated 10min after us got their appetizer, soup and main dish before us.  One waiter seemed to be doing everything from being in the kitchen to serving food to asking how things are and working the cash register (he was awesome!).  Hostess at the front door did not have any personality at all, and didn't say anything or come by throughout the night.  Another waiter only came by once to fill our water, and that was when we were almost done with our meal."
test_183,"I haven't had many massages so I''m not to hard to please but I was pretty disappointed with my experience here. The massage was ok but had many distractions and seemed undedicated, but I get the impression my therapist was new. The room was super bright until after I was already on the table and the therapist came back in, and I could here people talking in the hall and the waiting room throughout most of my massage. I also found the front waiting room very awkward and small and not the appropriate place to be reviewing a person's personal details before taking them back for their massage. Won't go again."
test_184,"YUMMY!!! Discovered Squarz at a local farmers market and return again and again to find perfection. Their assorted tasty pastries are a family favorite. We LOVE their BBQ, Shepherds pie and apple pastries.  Support this mom and pop business and shop local..."
test_185,"I tried buffet, Food was just ok, too much oil and too much red chili in all the dishes. tables were not clean. Couldn't find bowls for soup & deserts, had to use steel glass for that. Restaurant is big but maintenance was poor. All the waiters are super busy and no one listens to you, so if you want to ask for anything then better forget to ask."
test_186,"Great food, really enjoyed my time over. the place might be small with not much stuff on the wall but who needs that. I cam for the pizza and loved it,"
test_187,"After my last horrific experience buying a new car, I swore to myself that I would never step in a new car dealership again.  I was really interested in  GLS300, so broke down and visited these guys.  Told them I was not ready to buy just yet.  They could not have been nicer.  Explained everything about the car and took a test drive.  No pressure, just asked that I give them a chance when I'm ready to buy, which I certainly will."
test_188,"Been here many times over the past decades. It's huge with tons of options. It used to be one of the best places to chow down with family and friends. The quality has slipped a bit and the lines have declined. 

With the consolidation of most hotels to pretty much four main companies in the strip, buffets no longer have a uniqueness to them. 

I remember being amazed as a child but as an adult and after visited other buffets in Vegas, I was sad to see that this place has lost a bit of its luster. 

I will add though that the service has always been great! 

If you're in the MGM and have a huge appetite, then you've come to the right place. 

If you play slots or tables, you'll want to join their players card and earn a free meal as well as discounts to their rooms. What's good is you can earn comps at any of the MGM properties and redeem at their other spots.

Depending on your status you may not have to wait long in line."
test_189,"Stopped by the store.  We had $1,000 in a FSA account we needed to spend.  We were ignored as other customers, who came in after us, were waited on.  After 15 minutes, we decided they must not want our $1,000 so we left.  Lots of paces to buy Rx glass....no need to be treated like this."
test_190,"Ten stars would be more appropriate. By far the best Vegan food I've ever had. I am only here a few days visiting. I live in San Diego and wish we had this restaurant there. Everything I tried was amazing, breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts were incredible! Absolutely love this place. Staff is friendly and attentive."
test_191,"This was my first wax ever and I chose to get a bikini full, everyone was so warm and welcoming! I was given Jessica and I'm so thankful. She was very friendly and professional. I was so nervous and anxious to get my first bikini full but Jessica made me feel comfortable during the whole wax. After she talked me though the different serums and polishes to use on waxed areas. What to use what not to use, all very helpful!  Thank you thank you thank you Jessica. I will defiantly be returning in 4 weeks!"
test_192,"I didn't even eat here because it was so dirty, bathrooms were so bad, salsa bar a mess, turned off really quick so we left."
test_193,"Delicious food and great customer care. Really loved meeting the staff members, they are wonderful people. I definitely recommend this place especially if you're craving Philly cheese steak! Also, they make you feel at home with their generosity and kindness."
test_194,"This place really is as good as everyone says it is. Delicious food and impeccable service. Try the ox tail, you will not regret it."
test_195,"The service at this Wendy's can be choppy, but last night it was ever so gracious. The young woman that took our drive-thru order gave us desserts at no charge (their excellent Cinna-middles and chocolate chip cookies) after our first choice (brownies) had been completely depleted due to customer demand. 

I'm still enjoying Wendy's standard menu items, particularly the new, improved Hot 'N Juicy burger. 

P.S. Fast food workers, along with all others, deserve a hefty pay raise...

test_196,"This used to be one of our favorite places

The staff is deteriorated in the last 20 years
So is the food, not worth what you're paying
Seems management doesn't care"
test_197,"I enjoyed my meal here. I did not see any roaches like Arik claimed. I did however find the place to be old and somewhat run down. What do you expect from an old family style Sonoran Mexican restaurant. Their salsa is tasty, and the burrito enchilada style was great. I'd go back but It's not on my short list. It's just okay."
test_198,"Okay, this place is close by, which is probably the only reason I still visit it rarely. The soup base is definitely average, if not subpar. Unfortuneately, I also get the same MSG dryness feeling in my mouth after I eat here. The noodles are okay, nothing special. The seaweed, scallions, and other vegetables do not taste fresh. However, one saving grace is that their meat is flavourful and tender. 

The price point for basic shio and shoyu ramen is around $7. The larger sized/specialty ramens are around $12-15. 

The service is okay, there is only one waiter. However, he does pour water and take your order promptly. 

Overall, just like the McDonalds next door, I do not come here for the food, but only venture here for the convenience."
test_199,"I was introduced to this charming lunch spot by my niece who attends Cleveland State University, since it's located just a few blocks off campus. I no longer live in Ohio, but when I'm in town this is our traditional spot to meet, talk & enjoy some warm & tasty Pho. 
We usually start with egg rolls-she gets the fried.  I enjoy the fresh shrimp & pork & the yummy dipping sauce that accompanied them. Then, being creatures of habit, we both usually order the traditional rare beef pho & it is consistently delicious. The service is kind of hit & miss - not an uncommon tendency in ethnic restaurants, but nothing that bad that I'd not return...quite the contrary we've been back time & time again & will be in the future!"
test_200,Be prepared for the best omakase experience in Toronto. The chef and his team's dedication to their craft is second to none.
test_201,Famous Dave's is great!! When I walked in I knew I was in for a treat!! They have the best drinks there! You have yo try their In-famous Margarita ...it has moonshine in it!! Yes I said moonshine! When you go you have to try the cod fish and the brisket it is so good!! The BBQ sauces are out of this world. Service is great and the prices are not cheap but not expensive it is a great atmosphere for fun and family will definitely be back to taste some more stuff of the menu!!! Definitely recommend this place!!!!
test_202,"First time here, possibly the last.
Service was extremely slow. When server finally arrived at table, she said ""what do you want to eat""  not how you should approach a table....I wanted to go elsewhere, but we stuck it out, we should have left."
test_203,Mike and his team are very responsive and very good at what they do. He texts when he is on his way and let's you. Have used him twice at our facility and will use him again.
test_204,"The food here is amazing!!  Great atmosphere and service as well.  I highly recommend ordering several things on the appetizer menu vs a meal because you get the chance to try a large variety of the things they offer.  Each small plate that came out was better than the next.  We were a party of 4 and ended up ordering about 70% of the items on the app menu.  We all walked away full and excited to have been able to try so many different items.  Among the favorites were the Langostinos, truffle fries, scallops, and gorgonzola flat bread."
test_205,"This restaurant was really good & we all had a wonderful dining experience with our large group. Excellent & attentive service, fresh & flavorful ingredients, nice plating of entrees, and walked out of there full & happy. Would definitely go back again."
test_206,"I been wanting to try this since I had heard of it in Miami. I love the fusion idea. All I have to say is miso marinated chilaen sea bass, YUMM. It comes with a Peruvian corn which is interesting. The rolls are not typical japanese rolls because of the blend of Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine. The last time we were here, we had the seafood paella which was surprisingly pretty good. The civiche's were ok also. Good food but a little pricey, and trendy ambiance."
test_207,"Ingredients can be better, for example, shrimp scampi crepe that has may be four or five popcorn baby shrimps in it. The cashier also seems to be so depressing and not friendly. Perhaps they are trying to copy real rude French people, if so, they succeeded."
test_208,"WOW! This burger place is unbelievable, I really recommend this place. They have great food and friendly staff!"
test_209,"When bad pizza and service go bad. No hot and ready, manager on cell, and doesn't give a shit about customer service. The cashier had to cut pizza and go straight to register without washing his hands. Has anybody had this experience before? 
The Little Caesar Pizza manager said she spoke to Mike the owner and that everything was fine. She was more concerned about speaking to the owner and making sure she was heard first before filling up the empty warmers with pizza! 
Michael, please get an employee that cares about your customers.
A couple waited close to five minutes (while I waited, they were sitting waiting on their pizza before I got there) for O-N-E pizza.
Please review your videos from 12:30 to 1pm."
test_210,"Awful service and food.
We were a party of six and spent a $100 on pizza and salad.
sorry to say that the pizza was bland and salad was awful.
We asked for an extra scoop of dressing since what we got for the large salad for a 1 teaspoon of dressing. That included about ten pieces of lettuce and four shavings of vegetables.
I am not sure what the fuss is about this place Nellos beats this anytime.
Was so excited to go there too There was a guy wandering around asking the tables if everything was good but never approached us at all  not sure something to do with being the only ethnic people there.
The waitress never came to ask us if we needed anything but did make sure to ask us to leave cos a big party had reserved the table. However NO ONE was waiting outside at all to get in. Thanks!!!"
test_211,"I have so many great things to say about Parker Pet Care I don't even know where to begin!

First of all, recently I had to give my two cats to my mother and my pup to a close friend because of a last minute move to the states that wouldn't allow me to have more than one pet. After this, my last pet Spencer was depressed, he would mope, not eat, not play, slept all day, hardly wanted to go on walks, wasn't interested in other dogs and it was truly heartbreaking to see him this way.

While I had to go down to look for apartments I needed a new place to board Spencer that I could trust (because the previous place had problems...another overdue review I will write after this.) After extensive research, phone calls, emails to very reputable kennels to find out they either aren't taking new clients or don't take toy breeds, I finally found Parker Pet Care!

Parker Pet Care is a massive cat and dog facility. They are very thorough, organized, friendly and extremely professional. In order to board him, he had to be assessed for non aggressive behaviour with other dogs through a free day of daycare that they offer. They have a window of time to drop the dogs off in the morning, and the same in the evening to pick them up, perfect!

When I came to pick him up, they presented me with a card that had a brief assessment and a great photo of him romping in the yard! I am a SUCKER for photos especially happy ones of my dog and I will say that that was the moment I was sold.

We continued into the facility for a tour where I was amazed, they've got ""happy trails"" a space for dogs to run and play, they've got another playground with agility equipment they can run, jump and play on, the playground also has two pools (one for larger dogs and one for smaller dogs.) When it's time for bed the larger and smaller dogs are separated in different rooms and they are crated (I know this bothers a lot of people but at least they are safe.) They also have a cuddle room where you can get someone to cuddle your pooch and give them extra TLC at different times a day. 

My biggest surprise was how CLEAN it was for the amount of animals they have there! My boyfriend and I couldn't see any doggie mess or smell any doggie odour at all (haven't we all experienced the punch in the face at other kennels upon walking through the door?)
Once the tour was over, they brought Spencer out and I was so glad that he had such a good time. He was still a bit wonky (because he lost three of his pals) but he seemed to be better even after one day!

A few days later we came in to board him and we got the gold vip package so he could participate in group play, we also left a blanket with him that smelled like home. They conducted another assessment to see what group(s) of dogs would be most suitable for him to play with comfortably (they are SO thorough!) I called later that week to follow up on how he was doing and I was thrilled when they told me he was playing and EATING regularly!!! (YAY, he's eating and playing!)

After about a week, we came to pick him up and I swear since his sleep over at Parker Pet Care he's forgotten about his old gang at home. No more moping, he's eating regularly, and wants to sniff bums again! It's like he's always been the only dog and he loves it. By the way, the blanket we left with him? You guessed it, DIDN'T stink!

I owe a huge thanks to Parker Pet Care for taking such great care of him during this hard and confusing time in his doggie life. His attitude has changed back to the cheerful dog I've always known him to be.

It really sucks that we are moving now because it's going to be really hard to find another daycare/kennel as good as this. At least its temporary and we'll be back in the new year!

A few things to keep in mind if anyone reading this is interested.

1. All dogs are crated when it's bed/downtime. 
I know some people don't like this. I, myself was iffy about this at first but I've had questionable experiences at another kennel (see next review) and now I actually prefer it because I know my dog won't get into trouble, as he usually does, when he isn't supervised.

2. If you're a downtown dweller, it isn't an easy commute being at Keele and the 401. Their other location is in Scarborough.

3. It isn't cheap, on top of the nightly rate, they've got additional packages and a la carte add ons (up sells.)
I have to commend their marketing because I'm definitely the demographic they are aiming for. To ensure my dog has a great time, I won't shy away from spending more on packages and add-ons such as ""cuddle time."" Yes, I'm a sucker but I know my pooch is in great hands here so every penny is worth it!"
test_212,First time there today because a co worker recommended this place. I have a big truck and have always had a hard time finding a good place. I paid $20 plus tip and I was not impressed  I won't be coming back. The inside of my truck still was dirty and they couldn't even wipe down the inside. I really wanted to like this place too.
test_213,"Kinda rude New Yorker ...but his work AMAZING! 5 years my tits still look amazing,never popped and honestly they are so natural looking and its line I got silicone which I didn't..he KILT MY TIT JOB! Don't let his anti social disposition of sarcasm stop you cuz his work is perfect!"
test_214,"I am nearing the end of my lease agreement and would just like to say I will miss this place.  It has spacious 2 bedroom apts and friendly staff.  Its a convenient location and very quiet complex, everyone keeps to themselves I will miss it here for sure, if it wasn't for growing little bodies I would renew my lease here in a heart beat.  If you come rent here you will not be disappointed."
test_215,"AVOID This Dealership unless You Want To Get RIPPED OFF !!!
Drove 1.5 hrs because avertised price of used BMW was reasonable. We test drove the SUV and were interested in purchasing until they came back with a price that was $2000 more than advertised. We were totally shocked at this ploy UNBELIEVABLE they tried to charge us $1209 more than advertised price for RECONDITIONING fees and $700 for DOC fees, AVOID this place they're CON ARTISTS. The staff must really have thought we were stupid I've never heard of adding reconditioning fee to an advertised price. What they didn't realize we were going to pay cash for a $28000 car oh well - their lose. I will never come back here and I advise you to stay away as well."
test_216,"My last experience with Sushi Island was terrible. A friend can not eat gluten and the staff was unable to understand or communicate which items had gluten in them. Several orders were forgotten and requests for beverages completely ignored. Todays experience was probably even more frustrating however. Walked in at 10 (they close at 11) and they were closing and refused to serve us.

My over all take away from this restaurant is that the food is nothing special and the staff gave me no reason to come back. Unreliable hours. Complete headache."
test_217,"This is a little hidden treasure!! Had dinner here on Thursday and can't wait to go back! Steak was cooked perfectly and done ""el Chico "" a house specialty!! Wow!! Chicken piccata with a few artichoke hearts that was so tender and sauce so perfect you've got to try it!! Donald... You put love in those dishes!! With brother Michael you guys are bringing your talents to every dish!! With mom and pop making you feel welcome it's true Italian American at its best!!"

La mejor comida mexicana y autentica la venden aqui mmmm yummy love tacos dorados!  
Aqui si sabe a Mexico!"
test_219,"I came in for the first time 2 nights ago and am back again.  The owner Dave and his staff are very professional and friendly.  I ha e been looking for my ""Cheers"" since moving to the area. I have finally found it.  It's called CAPS!!!

The prices are very reasonable and the menu has something for everyone.  I highly recommend CAPS with friends and/it family."
test_220,The urban sauce is amazing! Everything was perfect and the king crab was the best I've had in a very long time. I highly recommend this place to anyone!
test_221,"This location is the most beautiful of all the Wildflower Bread in Phoenix.  It has gorgeous glass flowers hanging from the ceiling.

The food is as beautiful as the decor.  The bread is always fresh and delicious, great selection.  The menu choices are varied.  My favorite is the Chopped Salad.  Each ingredient is presented in rows with the yummy dressing on the side.  A perfectly balanced salad that is not your usual lettuce and toppings.

This place is always crowded for lunch, even the outdoor patio is filled to capacity.
I have recommended Wildflower to many people, none have been disappointed."
test_222,"Love this place! Rice dishes and pho are all amazing! I loved the cooked beef and pork rice dish, always amazing!"
test_223,"Bob Her... in the service department was arrogant and rude.  Car was needed AGAIN for factory recall on a part.  His discourse promoting further work was as if WE were negligent in car maintenance.  The cost of two procedures, tranny flush and coolant replacement, was outrageously at over $650! 

 I called my mechanic, whom is certified and employed at a highly reputable auto shop, for a second quote.  He laughed at Bob and Bob's arrogance of only their Berge mechanics understanding the 'special' supplies for a vw and their gauging, exploitive costs ($650 for a $250 job).  

When I retrieved my vw, Bob H..bold spoke to me very condescendingly.  Bob, you are a paperwork customer guy at a Volkswagon, not Mercedes, car dealorship.  That is it.  Understand you small role in society and drop the unearned, hyperinflative ego card.  I am sure many kind, service-oriented employees work at Berge VW.  Too bad my only encounter was with Bob Herb...  I will never speak highlyof Berge Service and will only return when notified of another VW recall because of Bob.  Bob, learn the 11- 7 principle."
test_224,I took my mom here for brunch on Sunday and we had a great experience! The food and wine was amazing and the staff was very warm and welcoming! The chef even came to our table to make sure everything was to our liking.  I will definitely be back!!
test_225,"Went On Wednesday with my friend and our daughters so it was a girls night :)  Excellent food and that particular night everything was half off so it was even better!!  The place didn't have many people inside and so the ambiance was kinda dry but once the food and drinks started rolling it was excellent!!  I will say the hostess was NOT the highlight!!  She was the first person we saw and were greeted by and she seemed so blah!!  That's a problem.. She wasn't rude at all but she just seemed miserable.  Hopefully it was just an off night for her but if this is the norm then I can see why the place seems slow..  We had so many different things since it was half off night.. Pizza's, anti-pasta platter, garlic knots, risotto balls, etc.  it was all fresh and hot.  The server was nice and humble.  I cant wait too go back!!  The only thing this place needs in my opinion is CUSTOMERS!!"
test_226,We took our pup to Camp Bow Wow for the first time a couple of weeks ago. We did a 'trial' day at Day Camp to see how things went before we leave her for an extended stay when we go out of town. She loved it! All of the employees were super caring and took time to explain how everything goes during the day. We loved being able to check in on our pup online using the daggie cam. We will for sure leave her for an extended stay - being able to check in on her throughout the day gives us peace of mind.
test_227,"Organized a dinner with close friends, we were 8 and it was amazing. I know I will come back and so will my friends. Excellent service and food! One of us is vegan and had a salad, I tasted it out of curiosity.. it was purple-ish and spiced as I could taste a little garlic and it was just so good. I had the duck which was cooked perfectly, a mix of sweet and not sweet and the veggie mash it came with had a complexed tasty sweet taste. That same mash others had, was so good we had to ask the server what it was. Sorry I forgot the name but it wasn't potato and the server said its made with love and alot of butter. To me it tasted like heaven.
For desert I had the beignet which came with a salty caramel sauce..... that sauce.... just thinking about it I salivate and I'm not really a desert person.
We took pictures outside and one of the owners ( 1 of the 3 brothers) came outside to take picture of all of us. Did I say service was great? It was!
For us 8 it was our first time and not our last. Reasonably priced and for what you're getting it feels like a steal. I've paid way more for mediocre food.  For the record, I personally don't know the owners and was not paid to put this review but I felt compelled to brag about this place and hopefully I get to eat here again.
I took pictures of some of the plates so I keep in mind what I'll try next when I come back to Montreal.
FYI they have a share meal that some had which included the duck with fish and ribs with that mash... I will be back"
test_228,"I tried Scramble for my first time this morning...gotta say...LOVED IT.

We had the Brizza (breakfast pizza) eggs benedict....both dishes were great. 

The place is ultra clean with a modern touch.  The quality was great and prices were good.  I will be back...probably many times.

Also, the patio is dog friendly.  We got to check out the coolest miniature bull terrier."
test_229,"This was an amazing experience for me as a first timer with a Thai Massage. You wear comfortable clothing and do not undress like a typical massage. I came in and scheduled both a 1 hour body and 1 hour foot massage at an amazing price! You couldn't beat it! I normally pay one dollar per hour back in NH. The Grand Opening discount as well as being a first time customer, could not be more enticing to at least give it a try. My massage therapist Sunny was outstanding and after the massages were done (2 hours) I was so relaxed. I was there for the week for a training with a team of people and I brought the information back to the hotel to share. One of my co-workers joined me two days later and she was so happy she did. I highly recommend this place as you will see how friendly the owner is and how she cares for her clients satisfaction. On my second visit I asked for specific areas to concentrate on. This was a nice option if you needed more work on a certain body area they would accommodate you. If you are ever in the area you must give them a try!"
test_230,"Really large portions and great food. Service is typical Asian which is largely distracted and inattentive. But most Asian restaurants are like that. So if you can just learn to jump out in front of servers and drag them to your table, you will be okay. There is an unbelievable din as well as everyone talks above a dull roar. Worth it for the food though if you are not looking for ambience."
test_231,"Bill has been preparing my individual and rental property taxes for years. It is absurd to me that anyone could have anything negative to say about the guy. He thoroughly explains everything to me and answers any questions I have, even throughout the year. It has been a great benefit for me to have him handle my complicated IRA's and rental property taxes including some additional write offs I would have never known about. He is very honest and will call me if anything comes into question so that I always remain in compliance. My parents and brother have trusted his services for years as well. I recommend him to anyone who is serious about a tax and accounting professional."
test_232,"3.5 star.
Newly opened HK style restaurant in this area that's great for a quick bite and good for Asian style comfort food. Prices are 5-15$/person on a average with food and drinks included depending on what time you go in. The portion sizes are also very generous. They do have a breakfast menu that's from 7:30-11:30am and afternoon tea menu from 2:30-5:30pm. Food is usually cheaper during those times. The place itself is very bright and not too loud. 

What I ordered:
Beef rice noodle stir fry $8: it was very well done! One of the best ones I've had in a very long time. This dish tends to be quite oily so the noodles won't stick to the wok when it's cooked, but it wasn't very oily when I had this one. Seasoning and everything balanced out. The beef portion was quite generous as well. This came with soup of the day and a choice of tea or coffee as well.

Club house sandwich $4.50: this is a well known sandwich every single Hong Kong style cafe would have. They substituted the bacon with some turkey ham to make it a healthier option. It was pretty good except it lacked a sauce. You just came have a sandwich without the sauce. Even if it's just plain mayo would be fine! 

Overall I think this place is definitely a go to if you're sick of dim sum or have a hangover. The ratings would definitely change overtime once I've tried more of there items on the menu."
test_233,"A very good dinner. Fine beet salad, vy good Cornish hen, and a lovely dessert. Not inexpensive but worth it. The only problem--noise, so loud that you either shout or go silent."
test_234,"I hate when people compare restaurants, but I'm gonna do it. Matt's is in many ways the opposite of Snooze - it's quieter, the menu is simpler and pretty classic. I loved the decor and fresh flowers in the tables, it wasn't too trendy or trying to hard. You seat yourself. It has a very small business feel to it. The staff was friendly and attentive. I saw a manager on the floor all morning working with them. The food was pretty good - again, this isn't Snooze, so don't expect anything out of this world crazy. Think basic omelettes and waffles.  They have a rotating daily special: Monday's are huevo rancheros, another day is biscuits and gravy, ect.

I think my family's disappointment came with the price - they charge a lot for little things. An extra side of syrup cost an additional $1.50. That just seemed ridiculously expensive. My dad thought it was a marketing ploy to make the pancakes a little dry purposefully so you'd have to order more syrup. Dorky MBA family humor. But seriously. A dollar and a half for a little dinky thing of syrup is too much."
test_235,"Our first time here and we loved it. Very friendly people, interesting art, clean, and of course amazing food. We tried the pancakes which had coconut whipped cream and banana compote. Very hearty and big portion. We got maple syrup as well although it was really sweet enough without it. The bagel with vegan cream cheese was quite filling as well and the cheese had a nice creamy texture. We will definitely be back"
test_236,"As always, my shopping experience with blue Rose Pottery was outstanding. The items are beautifully crafted, ship quickly and are packaged expertly to avoid breakages. I am a repeat customer due to their quality and service experience."
test_237,"Went to Tropicana to see this over the stormy weekend.  Had no idea what to expect, but loved it.  Good sets and actors, great reading and films.  Would recommend to all my visitors."
test_238,First tine visit to Wong's and it won't be the last. On business in Tolleson and found on Yelp. Travel 200+ days a year and best Chinese food I have had in the last year!  Hot and sour soup best by far. Egg rolls remind me of china town in New York.  Will probably be back next week. I am unbelievably happy and did I mention the chicken fried rice and the sesame chicken. Run don't walk to Wong's
test_239,They serve an incredible amount of food really cheap. The mets were seasoned very well and the guacamole was amazing!
test_240,"Visited Playa Cabana Hacienda last weekend and the restaurant definitely gave off that indie, yet not-too-hipster vibe. With dim lighting, friendly staff, and a liquor bar that was miles high, I was excited to dine. Stupidly, we did not make reservations, but were lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar. Our waiter was extremely friendly, introducing himself and then telling us the specials for the day. One of which the octopus tostada that I had to get and my boyfriend tried their chill infused tequila concoction. His drink arrived first and I must say, one of the most complex, yet amazing cocktails I've had in a while. It took about 10 seconds for the heat to kick in, but it was wonderful. To order we shared the...
- guac & chips to start (that's a necessity for mexican food, of course)
- octopus tostada
- kalbi beef taco (lettuce wrap style)
- chicken taco
- ahi tuna taco
- and lastly, the octopus taco that they are so famously known for

All were extremely flavourful, and just the right portion size to fill us up. The only 'decent' dish was the ahi tuna taco, which my boyfriend described as slightly under seasoned and an odd combination of flavours. However, the homemade green hot sauce at the table was to die for, and gave the tacos the perfect amount of heat.

I will definitely be returning to Play Cabana Hacienda, and after this experience, am excited to try some of the other Playa Cabana restaurants."
test_241,She does really good hair. She's very kind and does  neat braiding. The setting is clean. Definitely will be going back to her again.
test_242,"""Go ahead. Drink. Drink. No, you're out of the family business, that's your punishment. You're finished. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.""
-- Michael Corleone to Carlo Rizzi in The Godfather

In the movie, Carlo is garroted on the way to the airport, but if he had made it to Vegas and aged thirty-some years, I swear he would be a dead ringer for Tony, the driver for Enterprise that drove us to and from our hotel. But I'm getting ahead of myself...

To allow our wives to fully exploit shopping opportunities in Vegas, my friend and I (both of us are engineers) needed to get away. We decided to take a day trip to Hoover Dam. After consulting with our excellent concierge, it became evident that to maximize flexibility and minimize cost, the best tactic was to rent a car and drive there rather than purchase a package that included bus transportation.

Our concierge worked her magic. A few mouse clicks and telephone calls later, she had us dialed into a $37 day rate for a mid-size car at Enterprise. We were given a phone number and told that Tony would pick us up the following morning at 10:00. 

I met my friend in the lobby at dawn and we slogged out a four mile run up and down the strip (it's hard to find the discipline to do this when you were out past midnight the night before having a $4.99 ribeye and egg special in the Victorian Room at Bill's trying to soak up all the bar drinks you'd had earlier). Freshly showered and feeling accomplished after the run, we met in the lobby again shortly before 10:00. 

Tony arrived right on schedule and strode into the lobby sporting craggy features, a perfectly coiffed pompadour, a gym-enhanced upper body, and a waistline that was starting to get away from him. When he opened his mouth to speak, we heard a vintage South Side Chicago accent. My friend and I looked at each other, smiled and came to the same conclusion: retired Mafia henchman.

During the short drive to the Enterprise office near the airport, Tony gave us detailed directions and tips to more things than we could ever absorb even if we were familiar with Las Vegas and had a map in our hands. He was a friendly font of information. The lot at the office was small and had very few rental cars parked on it. They must bring them over from the big airport facility on Gilespie. While my friend signed all the obligatory paperwork for us to rent the car, Tony showed me an alternate way to drive back from Hoover Dam that's a bit more leisurely and scenic.

The drive to Hoover Dam takes a bit over a half hour. Our clean and functional Ford Fusion performed just fine. On the way back, we took Tony's advice and turned off of Hwy 93 onto Lakeshore Drive, paid $5 to enter the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and drove along the lake. Descending through the foothills near Lake Las Vegas, you get a panoramic view of the whole basin below you and realize what a crazy place Vegas really is. A carpet of suburbia sprawls toward you from its epicenter amidst the tall landmarks on the Strip. This wouldn't be so striking if it weren't in one of the most inhospitable places on the continent--the Mojave desert. It's a bit surreal to see.

We topped off the gas tank, turned the car in quickly and encountered no issues. Tony, in his gruffly jovial way, drove us back to our hotel. He told us he'd been in Vegas for five years and had come here from Chicago. Yep--retired Mafia henchman.

Without Tony, this Enterprise location runs a decent three-star business. Tony gives it four-star flavor."
test_243,"No matter the name, since press the food here is terrible. Bland and boring. Service is also terrible. Only redeeming quality is the wine selection. If you change the name you should change the menu!"
test_244,"Was very surprised at how much we liked this place.  Walked in during the afternoon and sat around one of the fire places.  Was greeted almost immediately by a waitress, who was dressed in a very nice black dress.  She sat next to us and took our order and answered any questions that we had.  Very attentive and very friendly.  Drinks were well made and loved the environment.  The only complaint I had, was that we were sitting too close to the bar, so you did get the smoke coming by you, if you don't like smoke like we don't, I would just recommend sitting farther away from the bar."
test_245,"This place is adorable! They've definitely done well with the decor. The service is ok. We had several people constantly checking on us and they were fast and efficient. However, everyone that came to our table was lacking personality. Food was good, not great. I'm glad we came here to try it, but it wasn't so amazing that I'd come back."
test_246,The cheesecakes never seem to disappoint. The only problem is the wait times to dine in. It is always crowded on every visit. The place seems to be flooded with customers and they are willing to wait as long as they can  to get seats because the place is just awesome and worth it! (Speaking on behalf of the dessert menu only!)
test_247,"A hidden gem but it's worth the drive. Super and amazing friendly staff, really got a chance to know us and explain their menu. Got a free drink with our meal and also guarantee free burrito for your birthday. And the star of the show is their tacos! Amazing flavor! They also gave us free rice and beans to try out which is out of this world!"
test_248,"I ADORE this place. I am a bit of a shawarma connoisseur.. Mostly since Shawarma is my favourite food. I grew up in a Lebanese family so i know the difference between the yummy homemade stuff and the industrialized ""feed the crowd"" food. Shawarma Grill Xpress is defiantly homemade quality good! The ingredients they use look fresh hand picked and healthy. The space is beautiful and always kept clean the food is exquisite and the service is amazing. As a feminist let me say that this is the one shawarma place that treats you with respect without catcalling you, like other joints (*caugh.. Caugh villa madina*) Over all service is incredible. Food tastes amazing. Quality is amazing. The place is clean and beautiful! And they are OPEN FROM 11am-11pm  Weekdays and 11am-9pm weekends"
test_249,"Great vet! Everyone is so nice, the hours are incredible, and they treat you & your dog with respect!"
test_250,"came here with party of 9

service is okay as they have multiple servers attending the table.. they did not refill waters or tea in the first 30 minutes tho

we order the wok crab, duck, salt n pepper shrimp, beef and chicken.. the food came out promptly and we got everything we needed and the qaulity was average+

nothing to rave about but they more than adequately gets the job done"
test_251,"Great place, the staff was friendly and very helpful. It was clean and they gave me a move in special the was accurate. It was $49 and that included everything, I had looked at another place that said $1 rent for the first month and by the time they got finished with the other charges it was around $75. I definitely recommend this place, they are great"
test_252,Never order! Me and my coworkers ordered Mr. Hunan's in tempe at 10:30. At 12 they brought 2/3 orders. I called and the guy said it would be another hour and then hung up on me! I called back at 12:50 and asked for a manager and he immediately hung up! Don't ever eat there! Ugh!
test_253,"So, I'm never one to give negative feedback on any establishment unless it's to the point of regard that it's just been repetitive and not improved. Ever since I had witnessed my boyfriend make a car deal with this third-party dealership they have done everything to destroy the vehicle that he has purchased with them, I've never seen such unprofessionalism in a dealership and all of my life coming from a family who works in car sales for most of my life. Every time my boyfriend went to schedule a warranty service it seemed there was always an excuse in the matter of not being able to get him in in a timely fashion more alone or being they were not able to get him in until they could run out his warrantee as long as possible. Once they were able to get the vehicle in for service, it seemed they gave the vehicle back and returned it to him in worse condition than he had originally left the vehicle. It was supposed to have an AC problem corrected; which never did get fixed, and once the vehicle was picked up the four-wheel-drive that had absolutely no problems did not work at all and the front bumper had been hit and paint had been scratched off the bumper to the point of visibility but you could tell it most certainly had just happened while in their care.
Aside from the unprofessionalism when it came to honoring their contracts regarding the vehicle, it seems that no one knows what's going on at this dealership and seemed to have a circular pattern of passing along the problem until the point of frustration where nothing ever got fixed handled rectified in any means whatsoever. Now with the car having less than 11 months until being paid off; they've taken money for payment, and have still tried to repossess my vehicle to the point where I've had to have a tow truck; that's come to my home twice, call the company supervisor/GM and correct the extreme out of order of business corrected by their boss and leave my property! 
If I would have to give any recommendation to anyone thinking about using this company/dealerships services, I would certainly instruct you NOT to! If you need a car there are other third-party dealerships out there; that do not have or create these fraudulent side issues! If you need a car, and are willing to pay cash for it monthly. This dealership is a scam artist dealership, and I'm sure will most certainly have lawsuits if not already! Considering the grounds of how my family has been treated, and the way that they do their financing is responsible/cars 2 go is responsible back and forth in the circular pattern mention above [this is most definitely there M.O. in their ways of scamming people out of their money] -please do not make this same mistake! It's not worth the cash you're trying to improve yourself with at dealership only trying to rob you out of your $$. This is no dealership that's willing to work with you please seek out other options; especially when it comes to a third-party dealership this is not the one!"
test_254,"Angie's List makes it difficult to cancel and they will bill you for another year because they make you ""autorenew"" when you sign up.  Because of the auto renew payment was setup as authorized, you cannot dispute the charge.  Their 888 number is only for certain members, otherwise it's useless.  The chat doesn't work because there are no agents.  Your only recourse is the form that you fill out online and they have not responded to me for cancellation after 2 tries.  What a bunch of crooks."
test_255,"Horrible service, horrible recovery. After waiting to be greeted, we waited 40-minutes before we finally left. Will never come back again. Horrid."
test_256,The Mac n cheese bacon burger was really good. Fries are solid. The pretzel fondue app was kind of wierd and hard to eat. My problem with the joint is it just tries way to hard to be edgy and cool. The names of things and the presentation are good illustrations of this. It's pretty good but it's always wearing it's sunglasses on the back of the head. But I didn't find a bleached white hair in my food so it's all good.
test_257,"I didn't listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. 
Do not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though."
test_258,The grape leaves and chicken chili are delicious! Their hot sauce with the hummus and pita is also amazing. They have delicious desserts and great portions! The prices are also very reasonable and the staff is always friendly!
test_259,"I cant even begin to explain how angry and upset I am right now. I have been going to this location for a year and I always order extra onions on my chicken sandwich. when ever  there is a new employee making my sandwich they always snide and snicker and makes jokes about the onions. Usually I just ask them if I am paying for comedy and judgement with my food and they never make the jokes again. this has happened several times. My husband went into the subway location and the GM was there along with an employee who recognized my husband and has made our food before and was aware of how much I hate the onion jokes. My husband comes home and on my sandwich is ONION SANDWICH WITH A SMILEY FACE. I am now livid. I called and the GM answered and immediately he denied everything and said he was unaware of it, that he didnt know, that he didnt do it. He became argumentative. I was in tears. Right now I am pregnant and I am extremely emotional. I told him I was calling corporate. I call and customer service and a man named chris answered. He was aggressive, condescending, rude, and hostile. He asked me what I wanted them to do about it. I was in shock and said thats not my job. He then informed me he would have the owner call me. He became more and more angry, and at the end of the call I asked for his supervisor. He said WHY? I said because I asked. He then started yelling at me, saying he had done everything he was suppose to. I then said again I want a supervisor. He said there wasnt one. I said you cant be the only person there. and he claimed he was, that there was no supervisor, said he no employee # or way to identify himself, and then he hung up on me,  I am so angry, and upset how horribly I have been treated today."
test_260,"One of the bigger Korean Grocery store in Vegas, the price is moderate. Great service and nice foodcourt as well. Inside the store includes a pharmacy which has top notch service as well as a cosmetic store and a bakery :)"
test_261,"The latte I had was good.  My friend's fruit smoothie was a little too sweet.
The atmosphere is good, has a welcoming feel.
The chairs and tables are comfortable.

Pretty typical coffee/smoothie place.  Not so memorable and not so forgettable either."
test_262,"Had Journey Electric do a small project for us. We were extremely happy with the work and cost. The electrician was polite, knowledgeable and efficient. I will definitely use them again."
test_263,"We were driving toward this location (3/4 of a mile away) at 7:35pm today when we called for a pickup order of 2 sandwiches. Trying to be courteous, as they close at 8, we called ahead. We were told by the guy to call another Caprioti's that closes at 9pm. She was told it was too late for pickup orders. So then she said well we'll be there in a few minutes and maybe then they'd like to make us some sandwiches? By then he kind of changed his tune, but I was already irritated.  Off to a biz that wanted money. Why can't these small businesses treat customers right?  Do these workers understand they are going to be replaced by machines? The service will certainly be better.  With large sandwiches inching closer to $20 each now, you're better off going to a true restaurant. You clowns won't be getting any more beer money from me."
test_264,"Total must do if you are a Marvel fan.  Plus, avengers infinity wars just came out this past weekend which made me realize I hadn't written a review for this yet!  First of all, buy your tickets at a discount at one of the half off booths or even online like Groupon or something as there are always deals.  You go in as a group but you still have plenty of time to linger and take all the pictures you want.  The whole thing is pretty immersive and interactive which is fun.  You can see tons of costumes behind transparent holograms/projections and there are tons of photo ops for props such as cap's bike and shield, Thor's hammer, etc.  The ""tests"" were kinda lame but super fun for kids.  The best part is all of the iron man suits and iterations at the end.  Worth the afternoon check out as a break from gambling and clubs!  

The shop at the end has a ton of great toys and you can dress up and grab some pictures (most coupons have this included so be sure to grab one)."
test_265,"The weirdest parking garage at a casino ever. It was so packed that we had to go to the top- but the elevator doesn't reach that level. Coming back- you have to go to the next to the last level, and walk up there. It was confusing. Why the heck did they design this parking lot so poorly? It is so complicated to get a parking space that we haven't been here in years. It's also very small. I've heard that employees have a hard time finding a parking spot as well. There is only one store I like anyway- Dooney & Bourke. Yes, the gondola ride is neat but it's $15.00 each for a ten minute ride, with singing. I guess if you were to do this once, it'd be ok. It's kinda pricey, I'm just saying. I will say that the casino is pretty, though."
test_266,"Chip, Nick, and Eric make this bar happen. Best kick back spot in the Southwest. The place keeps going way into the wee hours with a friendly  crowd  the whole night. This is not just a gaming bar kick back be sociable."
test_267,"This ""restaurant"" never gets my order correct.  This morning, I ordered two bacon croissantwiches and got one bacon and one sausage.  What a load of shit!"
test_268,Tried the Grecian Delight Pizza and Aegean Club sandwich. Large & delicious portions! Would definitely recommend this location! Great service too.
test_269,"This place gets crowded. Waited 20 min for a table at 12:30pm during the lunch rush. it clears out after 1:30pm, no waiting after the lunch rush. The portions are HUGE here with the typical Deli style sandwiches and bagels.  The bakery has great items too."
test_270,"Freewheel has something for everyone at any budget! Everyone in the shop is so friendly and knowledgeable, and their classes are free and very informative."
test_271,"This review is for the restaurant in the basement of the hotel.  It is called Bucci's Steak house.  For a steakhouse, the menu is limited to one page, and well, there are only a few steaks.  My business partner and I had dinner, both ordered the Filet, Medium rare, $40 a steak.  BOTH steaks were overcooked.  They cooked us both new ones, mine was charred.  At least they took it off the bill.  Selection was limited, service was mediocre at best.  I wish I could give it less then one star.  This is not NEAR the quality of a real steak house. GO ELSEWHERE."
test_272,"*NOTE* Although I gave the restaurant a 4, I feel as though it should right in the middle of a 3 and 4. 

I opted for the higher rating here because I was impressed with the food - both main course & dessert. It was a pleasure to dine there. However, a tad overpriced...it's pasta/pizza, not some high end delicacy. Their desserts are quite expensive as well, however I will say that the Apple Cobbler was one of the best I've tried so... DO TRY IT. Service was very friendly and staff made you feel right at home! Ambiance was great and it helps that the restaurant is big...lot's of ""air""."
test_273,Tried this place last night... its very good location with a nice patio. The food was fresh and was good. I only gave it 4 out of 5 just because I have tried Thai food twice now and really not impressed. Food not that favorable. I think I will be sticking with Chinese and Japanese.
test_274,"Very friendly & helpful staff, they carry specialty dog food at great prices. Love coming here for my fur kids! They also offer low cost vaccine clinics on saturdays"
test_275,We sat at the bar. The bartenders were really nice and fast even though the place was packed. They suggested us to try some great beers. The food was OK.  The menus need to include more healthy choices. I would give this place a 4.5 * but can't.
test_276,"In and out with brand new tires on a Saturday morning in 23 minutes. Awesome, I'll be back for my tire needs..."
test_277,"I give Kotobuki about a 4.5...

I have been here tons of times, and also sampled some of the ""best"" sushi in PGH (Umi, etc.) and Kotobuki comes out high on the list.

The sushi is very good, nice presentation, friendly staff. BYOB is always a plus. My favorite roll is the Sunkist Roll. Get this one! It is a spicy salmon topped with very thinly sliced lemon slivers. It definitely has a kick to it, but the balance of lemon adds freshness. SO GOOD. I have never had a problem with the freshness or taste of any items on the menu. 

Since they are under new management, they have a new menu, but still have some of their signature rolls from the previous menu. The veggie roll has definitely improved on the new menu! 

One thing that makes me sad is that it is always super slow when i go... I think they get a lot of take-out orders, but it is also in a hidden spot so many people probably just don't know about it. I could see that being a turn-off when someone walks in and it's empty. I took my aunt there, and she was very skeptical that it wouldn't be good, fresh, etc. She had reservations of the quality of the place, but after we ate she took them back. She loved it!! 

Love Kotobuki, but one small thing: the edamame is VERY salty. Most people like salty, but just a bit too much for my taste. It does come out hot though, which is good and some restaurants don't serve it hot enough!

That is all..."
test_278,"Omg...so good.Stopped for dinner because I heard good things about Yard bird and I'm a Gordon Ramsey fan. We had the fried chicken and it was delicious, actually heavenly . Full of flavor , juicy and tender. We talked about it for days. Also ordered the Okra another hit, I've never had it prepared that way but loved. Great food, Great service. If I'm every back in Vegas I'll definitely go back to Yard bird."
test_279,"A few weeks ago after bowling I ventured to the Bunkhouse with one of my teammates for a quick nightcap.  It was about 9:30 p.m. on a Friday night and it was fairly busy but not packed.  I had not been there in years, literally lived in an apartment complex behind the bar back when I was younger and was definitely a ""regular"" in the day.  

We only stayed for one cocktail, the bar is kinda divey but a pleasant environment.  The large patio is a nice feature that most bars don't have.  If I still lived in Central Phx and not Tempe I would be there more often."
test_280,"""Ca Roule"" - for the non-Frenchified pronounced, ""sah- (r)ool(h)""-  was a great find and budget-wise was great for the pockets as well.  There was one of many options of renting a super-comfortable ride (plush leather bottoms anyone?) but here are just 2 we considered:

1. Bike Tour: average price ~ $45 with tour guide and likely accompaniment of several annonymous tourists (good way to meet new people!), 4 hour trip total.  They have set times that they leave so plan accordingly.

2. Half-day rental: For the weekdays, only cost $20 which was a great deal and what we ended up choosing.  They provided a self-guided map and my friend and I ended up riding to/from Atwater Market for lunch, the Grand Prix stadium (which also has a beaautiful garden, a must see), and crossing the big bridge over the St.Laurent river (great view).   All in all was a 4 hour trip, easy ride, probably covered at least 10 miles.

Best way to travel in Montreal, do as the Canadians do!"
test_281,"We got a table outside which was nice. For an appetizer, we got the deviled eggs which were very good. For dinner, I got the turkey avocado panini and my boyfriend got the spicy sriracha chicken. The turkey was very tender but there could have been a lot more flavor and spice but the spicy sriracha was very tasty! The fries were good too but had a little too much seasoning. For dessert we got the cheesecake which was also good and the flavor was great. With this all being said, the only reason I am giving this restaurant three stars is because of the service. It took FOREVER to get our food and drinks and one of the drinks we ordered we had to send back (and we aren't that picky). It took at least thirty minutes to get our dessert, which was already made! Furthermore, whenever servers were coming out with food, they had to go to pretty much every table in order to find out whose food it was! I think that there needs to be more employee training here all around and then maybe we would go back. It's too bad, because the food was actually pretty good."
test_282,David our waiter was outstanding. The place was packed but our food came piping hot and was great. Will put this place on our list to come back in the future.
test_283,"These guys are awesome. Sean came out, did a great job on walk through, and the crew was on site in 2 days. 

Very competitive pricing on spray foam insulation in attic. Crew was neat (big thumbs up in my book), on time and professional.  The field manager Mike came by on the first day to check in, and is very friendly and knowledgeable. 

Sean was out again to perform an energy audit to get me a credit with SRP to offset cost of install. All included in bid. 

Spray foam is the best there is, and these guys run a great show, get it done, and don't leave messes. 

Thumbs up!"
test_284,"Discovered this little slice of heaven after doing a Google search for wings in the Pittsburgh area. I asked people if they've ever eaten here to which no one had. I'm glad I was the first of my friends to eat here so I could tell them all to support this business and I'm extremely happy to report the wings are amazing. They are whole wings (not jumbo) and they sprinkle white pepper on the top of them and possibly other seasoning and it just makes it stand out over other wing joints. Cheese sticks, jalapeno poppers and breaded mushrooms are also fantastic. The ranch dressing is great and their marinara may also be homemade. If you haven't tried their food yet, it's definitely worth it. Any time I need a boat load of wings, I'll be ordering from here. Also if you spend over $30 you can save 20% off your order (or at least I did, mention the coupon on their website)!"
test_285,"Customer service is just not nice in general. We waited for a good 20 mins without anyone explaining us how to order. The food is not great compared to its price. I ordered a sweet dumpling sesame soup, the taste was bland. The milk pudding with ginger juice tastes all ginger. It's a great place to hang out but if you're into the food, I'd not recommend."
test_286,"I was super excited to find out that they were building one here, I've been seeing pictures on social media and couldn't wait to try. I came here twice and the service has been great. One thing right off the bat, the lemonade fell short of great, it's kind of going in the right direction, but falls off a cliff. To the main event....the tenders, fries, and sauce are a Trilogy of flavor. The first time me and my wife tried the chicken tenders she  had to turn the light on in the car to make sure the chicken was done, the chicken was not only done!!! It melted in your mouth they're consistent with the product it will keep us coming back for more."
test_287,Such A great spot to stop if you have kids and are hard up to find kid friendly spots. So over circus circus and Excalibur. Great nostalgia in there. Will certainly return.
test_288,"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in all of Cleveland! Great prices, with a friendly staff. They always remember me when I return and are very talkative. The Hawaiian roll is to die for! They run specials on the basic rolls every Tuesday and Wednesday. Your food comes out prompt and fresh every time!"
test_289,"I went to this establishment on 01/15/13 to fulfill my Wellness Benefit for my Health Benefits.  This visit was extremely quick as they weighed, measured, and checked my blood pressure.  They also influenced me to get the Flu shot, as they explained people had died from the flu at that point in the year. 

I paid my co-pay and left, planning to return in the future for a full physical.  A few days after this visit I found out that my HR department had made a mistake during my enrollment, and they made the mistake of showing no coverage for my domestic partner (my girlfriend) and I.  I was forced to place a dispute with my HR, which was a 30-45 day process.  

On 02/11/13 I received a phone call from Amber Perez from Warner Family Practice stating that I owed a balance of $227.00. I explained the situation I was in, as my HR had been taking the payment out for the Health Coverage all along and currently, as well as having AETNA cards.  I explained that I was in the middle of an appeal with my HR and that within a couple weeks it should all be fixed.  I also explained that I would willingly pay if for some reason they didn't fix the coverage, but I did not want to pay until this was over as it would be a nightmare to be reimbursed.  She coldly stated that they would not do that and they can arrange payment arrangements, and she will be mailing me a bill. 

I called after work days after receiving the bill hoping to speak to someone else to explain the situation.  There was never an answer and I left a voicemail asking for a call back, which I never received.  Below I have shown emails from Ms. Perez.  I sadly purchased a home just behind this office and planned to have them as my family's doctor.  But after this HORRIBLE treatment I would NEVER recommend anyone to go this money-hungry office.


----


Hello,

I called on Tuesday at 430pm and left a voicemail with my telephone number. I also explained that I am in an appeal with my HR department, as I paid for coverage this year. I would appreciate it if I could wait until the end of the month, as my appeal was filed on 1/28/13, and can take 45 days. I have no problem paying if I need to; however, my insurance should be paying this. 

Regards,
Colin 

---

I did speak with you on 2/11/13 and explained that we are not able to hold claims you are appealing. If the insurance contacts the office with payment information then we can put as their responsibility, but at this time they do state you are not covered. We can set you up on 40.00 monthly payments or payment in full and of course will reimburse you if they make payment.

Thank you for your prompt response. I will be checking with my HR department to see if there has been any resolution to my appeal. Paying in full is not an issue, but I know getting that back from my insurance company will be difficult. Regardless of this issue, I am baffled at your customer service, I will be sure to tell everyone I know how your company solely cares about a payment and your lack of concern for patients. 

-----

I just called my HR and was told my insurance has been corrected. The policy number remains the same as I provided. I then called AETNA and was told there is a 7-10 day time frame until this is fully fixed. 

Thank You,
--------

I can take out of your responsibility and I will verify with Aetna they are processing you claim for you in that time frame, thank you.

test_290,"Simply outstanding! Mr. Fieri has proven himself once again as being this nations's premier chef. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all exceptionally good.

1) The ""Honkey Tonkey Double McBurger Blaster"" was phenomenal. The two beef patties were masterfully placed between two artisan created pieces of toast. Accompanying this sandwich was Guy's Ragin Flamin' splooge sauce that added subtle notes of hickory and leather.

2) ""Guy's Mozzarella Sticks"" were truly out of this world...possibly in the next universe. White cheese resembling mozzarella was delicately coated with a bread crumble that Guy calls Pano de coto. Simply outsanding!

3) ""Le Chicken Dubenaise"" was the star! A fully cooked chicken was presented table side and the waiter sliced each piece to your liking. It was then served with the most delicious Dubenaise sauce I have ever had.

This is THE destination restaurant on the strip."
test_291,"We have to set the record straight about what's original. Chris Bianco had his first wood fired oven in Town and Country on 20th st and Camelback. He was young and passionate and his pizza was sublime. I never really understood his move downtown but it worked out for him, at least in the fame department. We found it too difficult to be loyal followers at the Adams location with the long waits and lousy parking. The pizza was excellent, but the hype about it being ""the best"" was a distraction, and like all such titles is debatable and temporary.
The operation has expanded to 2 eateries and returned to almost the same spot in Town and Country and   we think it's darned good. The service is attentive and the menu is appealing. We prefer it for a late lunch outside, but that might just be an age factor. I miss the good old days listening to Chris extoll the virtues of fresh mozz to my culinary son,but today's version is still solid fare"
test_292,"Had the 3-item Custom Burger with avocado, cheddar and fried egg. It was delicious!!! And they even stayed open a few minutes late so I could pick up my order. The staff was friendly, the portions are generous and the atmosphere is wonderful. I also recommend the sweet potato fries, yummy!"
test_293,"Very good piia and the wings, were very very good! We will certainly be back! Senior Pizza himself waited on us, what a super nice guy, and really passionate about his food and customer service!  What a fantastic place with so many options. There are even ribs and beans being offered!"
test_294,"Beautiful antique ambiance, amazing coffee and great brunch - homemade iced fruit teas that are worthy of the five stars alone. The most outstanding part about Rustic is the wonderful people who work there - Nicole handles the crowds with grace and humor that keeps the wheels turning and the people coming back for more."
test_295,"We have been living here for almost a year and what I like about Strayhorse is it is really quite here. I think a lot of that is because it is a small complex. The staff is great and always friendly. Whenever I put in a service request they are usually here that same day to fix the problem. They are pet friendly which is great, but there are a few knuckleheads that don't pick up after their dogs. Hey if you have a dog it's your responsibility to pick up after them, people. Unfortunately, the few always ruin it for the majority. But the cool thing is that the service guy always goes around first thing in the morning to pick up after those inconsiderate ones. I would recommend this complex."
test_296,"LAVAL... we have a problem. lol. I want to hate this place so badly. A suburb hamburger place that screams doooooche. Fake blonds and muscle men with barbwire tattoos in every direction. But the problem is that I don't hate it.

It's not bad. And in a world of bland Baton Rouge and Madison Steak House, this place is at the top of my restaurants in Laval to get a burger with a few friends. The food is ok. I wouldn't go as far as some of the other reviewers, but it will do just fine. The decor is pretty cool. The service works well enough despite always being packed. And every time I go I LOVE the music. So what's the hate... that guy who drove up in the yellow Hummer? Yes, but I see myself returning none the less. 

PS: The a picture of Larry Bird on the menu. I should give them 5 stars;)"
test_297,"We got married here a month ago and it was a dream come true. Came together more beautifully than I could have imagined. Chrystie, Laura, and Katie were amazing to work with. The yielded my hundreds of questions without ever seeming annoyed and were so helpful at making my special day perfect including setting up all the diy stuff I brought in. Didn't need a day of coordinator with these ladies on my team. Day of catering staff and bartender were also great to work with. Kept the food warm and the drinks flowing. All of my guests had an amazing time and kept commenting on how beautiful and magical the Ashley Castle is. It's a truly unique, beautiful venue that makes you feel like you're not even in Arizona. I knew as soon as I walked in that I wanted my wedding there and I'm so glad I chose it. Couldn't have been more perfect"
test_298,Bestvtaco spot ive ever been to they have a wide range of flavors. I love this spot lol
test_299,I checked the ratings on Yelp before visiting this place.  Everyone went on and on about it saying how if you live in Phoenix it's the place to go.  Uh....NO.  It was disgusting.  It was over priced for what it was and not worth it at all.   My advice...if you're looking for fast food seafood just go grab some frozen food and put it in the oven.  That's going to be much better than anything you're going to get here.
test_300,"maple cake, blueberry cake, fresh crullers, everything, favorite donuts-- though i believe it has egg, so i try not to eat them too often. donut hut is perfect for late-night munchies, if you are into that sort of thing."
test_301,"I've shopped at this Safeway store for almost 15 years and have always loved the clean store and excellent customer service. In the last few months that has changed - I've had several bad experiences that I've reported to the manager without seeing any change.  Very often the cashiers talk to each other without even greeting customers, baggers crush items and I've even had to ask them to at least keep bagging while talking to each other so I can get out of the store...even witnessed a bagger pick a (verbal) fight with a customer while waiting for a manager to resolve a problem. I'm just consistently disappointed."
test_302,First of many visits to come. Bruschetta boards are worth the trip. Nice wine selection as well. Server was very helpful. We will absolutely be back.
test_303,"Great customer service! They take the time to find what you need and find your true shoe size.  
I learned so much with just one trip.  The shoes are pricey but it's totally worth it for the comfort! Plus they aren't cheap made in China shoes so the quality is excellent."
test_304,"Not again.
We have 3 cars insured with AAA, one with Progressive and two motorcycles also insured with Progressive. 

It was renewal time so I shopped around.  I could not get a straight answer from Progressive about the combined cost for a 6 month period. ""We can't tell you the cost since one car is renewed in August, the others in October."" WHAAAAT.
Since they were more expensive for less coverage, we went with yet another company. Out of being p'd off with Progressive, I canceled the one auto policy I had. What balls they have.  Charged me $75 to cancel, then the rep tried to SELL ME MORE INSURANCE. AYFKM ?  Can't believe this.

I hope they recorded the phone conversation. 
Next June when my motorcycle policy with Progressive expires, GUESS WHAT !!!"
test_305,"If i were to compare the other crepes restaurant that ive been to,i can say that i had far much better than the one i had in here,its good but for the amount that i paid its not worth it"
test_306,"This may just be my mistake in choosing a dish as I ordered Pho. In retrospect, maybe ordering Pho at a Chinese restaurant isn't the smartest thing because it tasted exactly like what you might expect - a Chinese take on a Vietnamese dish. Thin broth, definitely not prepared for hours with the love one must put into creating a deep flavored beef broth. And the spices were off - maybe a little too much on the Chinese five spice. In all fairness, I will have to go back and actually try the Chinese food to truly give this a proper rating."
test_307,"We ventured back to Rustic Cafe on Sunday, this time for breakfast and really enjoyed it. The service was great as was the food. Way too much to eat in one sitting. 

Ultimately they probably have a few kinks to work out, but it's been darn good both times we've been there."
test_308,Not very impressed. My food looked better in the photo on the window. I paid for the Hawaiian bbq wrap but it is bbq crap. They didnt even cut it for me. Not returning ever
test_309,"Extremely rude, mean workers..whoever the older lady is at the front desk... she needs to be fired. She grabbed my box, huffed obnoxiously loud, and threw my box across the counter. What a nightmare."
test_310,"Delicious! Had the carne asada tacos which came with two types of rice and beans, it was out of this world. Also had the cubano enchiladas at the suggestion of our server Sarah, who made fantastic recommendations.  The whole staff was very friendly and made sure our visit was great.
They make strong drinks and have specials daily!"
test_311,"We moved cross country to Arizona, we had no idea who to call for painters.  So we checked Yelp!  We bought a lovely home but a bit dated and wanted to spruce up the ugly dark oak cabinets in the kitchen and office.  We called Canyon Sky Painters and they came right over within a day to give us a quote.  Met with Ross and his brother Jose, super nice and professional.  We interviewed other painters as well some came in with higher quotes and others about the same as Canyon Sky.  Ultimately we went with Ross at Canyon Sky Painters due to his chipper personality and willingness to please the customer.  Honestly two super nice guys the cabinets came out great and ultimately it looks like I have a new kitchen.  We will have them back for other jobs.  I will post photos of the end product once we get knobs/pulls on cabinetry.  
On a side note they cleaned up and took all trash, paper with them...bonus!!!"
test_312,"So the crowds and general euphoria seemed to have died down since the opening of Sidebar six months ago. After more than a dozen visits to this lounge, I'm confident of my four star rating. In agreeing with what Kristin told me once, yes, Sidebar is very much what would happen if Roosevelt and Fez had a baby, at least design-wise.

The environment, decor, and drink offerings rock. A few quick notes to illustrate:
* Exposed brick and stairway entry that would make any East Coaster drool. 
* Cozy C-shaped booths for lounging. 
* Requisite absinthe dispenser in the middle of the bar and TV screens showing old films to indicate urban trendiness. 
* Kim Crawford sauvignon blanc by the glass, Anchor Steam by the bottle
* White space-age-ish 4-seater tables and multi-colored LED panel thrown in for good measure.

In a few birthday parties here, I have gotten different results. For mine in January, they gladly reserved a booth for my besties and me on a Friday at 9 pm. Of course, no signage or anything, so it was a bit of a hassle to say the least as the owner, Josh, gladly asked people to move. The next month, we ran into some resistance on reserving, but were able to manage it due to our own efforts.

Overall, service has definitely improved. Although, be sure to watch your drink as ambition can get the best of them - they took away several of our half-finished glasses when we weren't looking.  One complaint to the bartender, and this was fixed. 

A new and appreciated detail is their drink menu featuring some unique cocktails. One request would be to beef up their appetizer offerings."
test_313,"Second buffet stop in my 5 day stay.

The highlight of the restaurant had to be the fire alarm that rang out in the middle of our lunch. Heh, dunno what happened there.

All that aside, the food itself was below average to average. Probably the only thing I liked was the Har Gow. The dessert was loathful; leaving it out in the open for what seemed like for hours (the colours look way off). I didn't bother touching it, as who knows what kind of bacteria has grown in those things..."
test_314,"I've only been in here a few times and I have liked it every time. Their prices are pretty reasonable compared to other thrift stores and the ladies who run it seem very nice. If you go on Mondays it is half-off day, lucky for you if you find something as you want. I still wear a pair of shorts I bought here three or four years ago. I once bought a book in here just because I like the author and found out when I got home it was a first edition! After I read it I was able to sell it on eBay for a pretty good price. Their craft supplies are especially well priced, maybe $2.50 for an item that would be $8 over at Bookmans. I do a lot of knitting and crocheting for charity so I appreciated finding some yarn for a dollar a skein. If you are looking for unique, antique type furniture and accent tables etc, this is a great place to find them. If it was a little bit closer I would be in here every Monday. They close at 4 so it's sometimes hard for me to get here since it's often after that when I'm in the area."
test_315,It's nice they have food but I would say it's more about having a couple drinks and driving a few balls. It is a fun alternative to eating out!
test_316,"We found this place on yelp and the food looked fantastic!  It is a cute and quaint spot.  On Fridays they have $5 bubbly.  So we headed there after golf and sat down at 8:30 pm.  The fools coming out was mouthwatering.  We had some bubbly and kept waiting, and waiting.  Well at 10 pm they came out to say they forgot to put our order in!  So they gave us a cheese board and vegetable lasagna as compensation.  I will go back as the staff was great, the food looked sumptuous and our cheese board and vegetable lasagna, although not what we ordered, was still great."
test_317,"The Bagel Cafe is a dependable spot to eat great food in my neck of the woods, but I don't come here that often because, let's face it, I have no self control.  If they didn't  have a bakery, I'd probably be safe, but I just cannot resist!
So, a friend and I had breakfast this morning.  I thought I'd be healthy and ordered a veggie omelet with a whole wheat bagel.  Oh, it came with home fries, but I think potatoes are also a vegetable.  Anyway, that was delicious and very filling.  After paying our bill at the counter, my gal pal had to scoot, so she left me to ""browse"" the bakery area.  Well, browsing turned to buying, which turned into another instance of me facing my weakness for sugar. At least I had vegetables before the carbs were ingested.  See my pics for a couple of the pastries the cafe has to offer.  There's more to choose from, but you'll just have to go and see for yourself; I had to get out of there before I turned into a diabetic."
test_318,"Absolutely loved coming to Brilliant Bridal! This was my second shop during my dress adventure.  I worked with Talyn, and from the minute I walked in, she was very friendly to me and my friend.  Helped explain the process and let us choose options, but then assisted by suggesting some of her own for me to try on. 

I tried on quite a few dresses but found the one!  It was a bit over my budget, but, not a lot.  Something that sold me on this bridal shop was the good testaments to their pricing range, the dresses are overstock, and are offered at discounted prices!  So I was soo happy to have found a dress here.  Thank you to the team at Brilliant Bridal for helping me make my dream day come true. :) You guys rock!"
test_319,"Ok this place is super COOOOL!!! Fun atmosphere, games, connect 4, pool, hacky sack and outside area WITH AN ICE RINK!!!"
test_320,"Attended JLO ""All I Have"" show on Saturday and  sadly we left feeling disappointed . Unless you have center front rows or close to stage tables or standing access, which means you paid over $1200 per ticket you won't enjoy the show . She needs to have big screens for the people that are on the 200 sections. Also if you are seating at the  seats on the sides  you miss a lot of her routines as she is for the most part facing to the front center! She should be more considerate to the people who are sitting on the sides. In addition to  that problem there are props that she uses during the show which  r pushed back so far to the end of the stage that the people again on the sides do not see her.. This problem  could've been solved if she had live cameras with big screens for those who can't afford to sit in the front be able to enjoy her show ..  Because let's face it while I adore Jennifer Lopez & she's my idol she's more of a dancer than singer so you do want to see her dancing!"
test_321,"I was surprised to see the decor upon entering the restaurant. I was imagining a tiny hole in the whole restaurant but was pleasantly surprised. The staff were friendly and we were seated promptly. We ordered seafood thom kah (we asked for seafood to be added), pad seew, and #41 eggplant dish. The seafood thom kah was served a few minutes after ordering and was very good. I wished it was a little bit more spicier but we did asked for ""medium"" spiciness. The other two dishes arrived maybe 25 minutes after we ordered. (reason for 3 stars). And that was the only bad thing.. Both dishes were delectable. My picky 2 yr old liked the noodles so much that he did a happy dance while eating."
test_322,"We had a great first time here last night. In fact, we stayed for five hours. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The beer list is long and nicely priced. We had the empanadas and battered cauliflower. Both were reasonably priced and very tasty. I caught a whiff of someone's garlic fries and that alone would make me return. They smelled incredible. We'll be back soon!"
test_323,"I don't think anything tops this place, and I am so so so sad that it closed down.

The portions were big, and the prices were really decent. They served free sinigang or nilaga, too. Although the setting wasn't that fancy or grand, the quality of the food really spoke for itself. 10/10, in my opinion.

I would be so happy if they re-opened. I basically grew up with this place."
test_324,"This place is cute, small, and at the heart of downtown phoenix! The staff is friendly, the ice cream is good, and they support local artists. 

It's quite random. I ordered two scoops of grasshopper mint. DELISH! Jets the random part: they put it in a Chinese food takeout box and garnish with a fortune cookie. HAHA! 

You go Melt!"
test_325,"I'm not a guy who normally gets his meat from a butcher, to be quite honest.  I have in the past, but not anymore than going to your local grocery store.  This shop has changed my opinion on that, and I plan on coming for more!  Possibly the best meat I've taken home to cook myself that I've found in the Pittsburgh area to date.

Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
test_326,"I came here on feb.11th for my 23rd birthday party and had so much fun!
all of my friends told me how much fun they had! how they loved the decor (as did i), the food was good (especially the pork sandwich and the white trash nachos) the music was interesting (it was reggae that night) and the only complaints i heard were minor (the place was a bit too narrow, the basement that held the bathrooms were cold)

everyone said how they loved how there was a really diverse crowd, good beers on tap, really great bar staff and the only other complaint I could think of was that the burlesque dancer didnt have the best sense of rhythm.

whatever, didnt stop me from putting $5 in her garter with my teeth!

go! you wont regret it! go!"
test_327,"Not what you would expect for a $150+ meal for two. For an ""upscale"" steakhouse the food and service were nothing great. First, we never got the bread our server said would be right out when we arrived. We proceeded to ask for it two additional times before it was finally brought to us when we received our entree. The halibut was ok, but over cooked and the sauce on top was over bearing. The calamari was decent, but I have definitely had better. I also wish they put whatever sauce they had on it on the side so they breaded part stayed crispy. The only saving grace of the meal were the Fleming's potatoes. They were delicious. I doubt I would ever find myself back here, but if I did I would get the potatoes. Lastly, its not necessary to ask every time you refill water/ice tea, just fill it up and if I am not thirsty anymore I won't drink it and thus you won't refill it. 

If you are looking for a delicious meal with great service this is not the place for you. My personal favorite in the valley is Mastro's City Hall - you will not leave disappointed."
test_328,"Alright, so I have eaten here 5 times since they opened. I must say, overall I'm very impressed.

As far as burgers go, this place is top tier. Not only are they more than sufficiently sized, the patty itself tastes incredible. Plus their selection of fresh ingredients is unmatched. Definitely beats the hell out of Five Guys and Highway 55.

Their sides are great, I personally love the ranch onion rings and their fried pickles (the whole pickle is fried instead of slices). But the fries are hit or miss. Some days they have been superb, others...not so much. However, I go to places like this for the burgers, not the sides.

Gotta love the beer selection. Lots of craft beers and  great selections from local breweries such as OMB and Red Oak. Definitely hard to go wrong here, and the pricing is quite reasonable as well.

I see a lot of people complaining about the service, but I have yet to experience anything worth mentioning. Each visit of mine has been quite pleasant, and our servers have always been cheerful and hard working. We did have one meal where the food took a little longer than usual, but they were completely slammed. Besides, who cares? Have a beer, talk with your friends, relax and enjoy yourself. It's worth the wait."
test_329,"This review is for the ""cafe"" portion. 
Pretty cool spot for super cheap $2.00/cup french press coffee. 
I love the deck they built, which overlooks the bay. I stopped by for a leisurely morning coffee with my bf on Sunday morning and had a lovely time. 
They are just starting to offer classes on paddle board yoga, kayak etc - I can't wait to sign up for the moonlight paddle series!"
test_330,"Had a business meeting here and I am quite impressed with their sweets! Cute place, clean although the service was slow. But worth the wait for my coffee and waffles.
Not perfect for business meetings as they get a bit noisy during lunch hour so they were busy but I will definetely come back."
test_331,"I'm sad that I just found this place and I'm moving out of state tomorrow! Cool vibe and great food, don't miss out like I did."
test_332,"I love that someone gave this place 3 stars because of their lack of vegetarian options.  It's a taco shop, not Pita Jungle, take your ass to an all organic second hand fair trade book store with that shit.

Anyway, there isn't much that needs to be said that others haven't already said - this place is fantastic and does everything from scratch with fantastic ingredients.  The frijoles charros are ridiculous and I can imagine that when it gets cold I'll be stopping in for more and more of them.  The meats are all succulent and the salsas are great.

Sorry there isn't any soyrizo though."
test_333,"One of the better AYCE sushi buffets in the area. It's quite expensive, but so good! I love their golden shrimps and maki rolls. The dessert is yummy too. I would say this is basically the same as Ten-Ichi (perhaps owned by the same person lol!?). Their menu items are extensive, and I have yet to be disappointed! They do get extremely busy during weekends though, so reservations are key in getting a table!!"
test_334,"Great location to take your vehicle for new tires, air, or an rotation. They are also fast and very friendly. I have always felt welcome here- please keep up the great service"
test_335,"If I could give this restaurant 1 star I would. 

Terrible service, I'm pretty sure our waiter was high. He was very awkward and kept coming over to our table and muttering under gis breath. Food is disappointing. How can you screw up basic breakfast is beyond me.The bacon and  potatoes were cold and tasted like they had been out for a day...very stale. 

The whole experience was very weird and disappointing. There are much better restaurant options on Mass on street that I would have rather gone to."
test_336,"My guess is Very Fair gets many of the elder generation Chinese demographic as regulars due to it's strategic LOCATION. It's next to a Chinese Grocery Store and walkable distance to a Medical building, also HSBC. Although there's a huge parking lot shared with other businesses in this plaza, on weekends it can still get quite packed for those family Dim Sum gatherings. 

Push Carts are a nice view although even without being stuck in the corner we still didn't get much Cart traffic to our area, fail. They might not have noticed that the younger ones tend to consume more in a shorter period of time, but then the elder ones are more routine visitors. 

The Dim Sum is far from pretty but taste was A-OK. There is a bit of visual disturbance as my friend noted some unsightliness on the Dim Sum dishes while I recognized the Dish under my Teacup had some stains. 

I found the Push Carts Ladies pretty nice and friendly and please notice that we were surrounded by a 'Cone of Newspaper' as all other tables had either Mingpao or Singtao reading the news and taking time to enjoy their meal rather than rushing. It works here because there's quite a bit of tables on this Weekday morning. If you don't do that stuff, I also noticed a child with a Portable VCD Player."
test_337,"Opening day and it didn't disappoint! Service was amazing. The additional training support made it feel overstaffed but everyone was friendly and informative on the menu and general questions for a new place. 
I tried the corn dog lollipops and they were great, the spice mustard made it worth getting. We had the Mac n cheese balls- to die for. This could have been my meal. Haha
I enjoyed the Chicken Tacos. They were spicy, tangy and delicious. I would definitely get them again. 
For dessert we tried both. They were equally as good. Not overly sweet but satisfying. 
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
test_338,"Perfect spot for me on the way home from work when I get a craving for noodles. The rare beef pho really hits the spot and the vermicelli with pork, shrimp and crispy fried rolls is also a solid choice. Unfortunately, the summer rolls aren't great and I've yet to try the banh xeo. But these guys get 5 stars for the noodle dishes and their fantastic, friendly service!"
test_339,"Great food n beer! I've been going to Brewsters Foothills for 8+ years, don't think I'll stop!!"
test_340,"Had the lunch special.. the food was fresh and very tasteful.
I have been a fan and client of the owners of this restaurant. 
So happy to have them near my office"
test_341,These guys completely suck with customer service and good luck getting the owner Tim to call you back because it just doesn't happen.  Eric came out and gave me a quote I told him I have a proposal from another company offering a 10 year warranty for a couple hundred dollars lower. Eric agreed to give me the 3 coatings without the additional fee of $500 they usually charge.  Because he did not initial it I'm screwed.  First they show up on the wrong day at 6:30am and wake me up. Then they come back because they sprayed the front of my house with foam and turned it yellow.  Then they come back for the second coat and they put the top coat on without telling me until after it's done.  I asked about the third coat and they tell me they were told to put only two coats.  I spoke with Tim and confirmed before they started it that it was a three coat job.  They even booked the two appointments to put each coat on.  I took two mornings off from work to make sure it was done. Then they play this game.  Looks like we will be in court over this because I don't play with contractors taking advantage of people.
test_342,Scott is amazing!  First I love the send a picture for a quote he has through Yelp!  He got back to us pretty quickly with a great price for removing a Palo Verde in our front yard.  When he arrived we worked out a price to trim 3 additional trees and remove a pygmy palm.  His work was impeccable and did a great job taking down the tree.  You can't even tell there was a tree there anymore.  He cleaned up his work areas and even cleaned up some additional plants that had died previously.  I'll definitely bring him back when it's tree trimming time again.
test_343,"A little overrated. Service is excellent and friendly but food is ordinary. We tried eggs Benedict, Florentine, Denver omelette and a traditional breakfast.  Everything was a tad overdone and only lukewarm.  A shame because our server was really nice and welcoming."
test_344,"I've been meaning to write a review of The Platinum for some time, but in years past I didn't, as I wanted to save this little refuge from the hoards of people that eventually ruin closely held secrets. 

I've been staying at The Platinum for nearly ten years, always for a security conference which should be no surprise if you follow my reviews on Yelp. I am here more for business, and there's some time towards the end to decompress before getting back to the gun and run of business travel.   

Every year the quality and customer service gets a little worse, the only constant is the valets which know me by name. (Probably because I tip better than most guests staying here). When The Platinum first opened, there was a black Cadillac Escalade as the house car, Eventually, Marcus Hotels which runs the hotel portion here took the Caddy to Wisconsin and replaced it with a white Suburban, now it looks like a GMC. 

I have stayed in Marcus managed hotels in the past, a recent stay at the Hilton Madison Monona Terrace offered some of the best customer service and attention to detail that I've experienced in a long time.

Last year The Platinum was replacing the wallpaper and carpets, and they didn't think that was an issue, other hotels would just close the floor and bring in the workers to get things done ASAP, not at The Platinum, This year I knew I would be doing lots of walking, lots of lugging giant boxes of 72 shirts for the hacker conference at Bally's and my luggage for attending five hacking, security, and venture capital conferences. You try lugging a Pelican 1650 around a hotel after flying 4+ hours to Las Vegas.

I booked off the website, I requested a strip view, and ideally a corner room which is close to the elevators. 10 years of staying here either with friends, other companies, and agencies, I called ahead asking for this and was told I'd find out when I checked in. I figured there would be some loyalty with keeping a long-time customer happy.

Nope....

I did get a strip view, but not without making a giant U to walk to my suite, this gets really old after about the second day of a 7+ day business trip. Other commentators have mentioned the rooms aren't all that clean, I took one look at the tub and scratched the idea of soaking my legs in the jetted tub, the shower wasn't the grossest shower I've used before, but could use a regrouting to cover up the mold. 

If you're considering eating in your suite, ask for a bottle of Dawn and wash all of the eating utensils and plates, I was thinking about making some overnight oats for breakfast and was just grossed out by everything, the knives outright grossed me out and I scratched that whole plan. 

After you've walked 10+ miles a day, more than a few days in a business suit in August, all you want to do is call for room service, maybe do a load of laundry, look over the menu, find some nice comfort food to settle into some reports. Only to learn from the front desk that room service ends at 11pm, the front desk was a little swarmy about this, as they said it should be mentioned in the menu (It doesn't) and recommended a bunch of pizza joints that deliver. 

Unlike most of the other Americans staying at The Platinum that week, I don't want to be average sized (or larger) stuffing my face with pizza. I would think someone could find other healthy eating options for delivery after room service closes for the night. 

Kil@wat, the restaurant on the fifth floor that likely closes at 11pm has breakfast, I'd recommend that you don't eat here if you are in a rush, they should really call it Kill@nHour as there might be four couples eating but it always takes 20+ minutes to get an omelet. 

I don't know if any of the managers have stayed in The Platinum as a secret shopper, maybe they could figure out why it is that you can use a bathroom sink, the other one gurgles for a few seconds afterward. I've stayed at plenty of hotels in over the years, The Platinum's bathroom sinks do this consistently.

TV remotes, the other commenters on TripAdvisor have pointed out that you have to mash on the keys to change the channel, and they are not kidding. 

Now after reading all of this, maybe you're thinking this is a fluke, or that this only happens to the Michelin Inspector in 'Oceans 13', What should I know if I want to stay 2-8 days at The Platinum on your own dime?

Strip Views are ideal as long as you're at least 10 floors up, so you can't hear the AM/PM and 7/11 mini-marts nearby but also mitigates the ambulances which have a base over on the east side / mountain view and run Code 3 24/7. South views will either have a view of Ellis Island or McCarran Airport. Don't eat at Ellis Island after 11pm because room service is closed or you will be subjected to the worse karaoke you've heard outside of the Ginza Shopping District in a helluva long time while you try to eat a chewy $6.99 steak. Tip the valets, they will remember you in the future ...if you return."
test_345,"The worst pedicure I've ever had! 15 minutes and my SPA pedicure was done. They have no clue on what they are doing... Usually I prefer to keep silent if I don't like something.  I only praise and if I have nothing to praise ... oh well... I hope next time I will have a better experience. .. But this time it exceeded all the limits! 
Beware! !! If you are planning to waist your time and money that is the place to go."
test_346,"My lovely daughter Whitney wanted to take me to the movies today.
It was delightful to get a chance to put on my Tuesday best and head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for lunch and a matinee!
It was Taco Tuesday so my thoughts naturally turned to Cien Agaves Tacos and Tequila.
The name, Cien Agaves means ""one hundred, green, spiny plants"" but I suspect there is more to the name than that...they also sell tequila...lots and lots of tequila. 
In fact, they sell more the one hundred kinds of tequila...a wide selection of various types and quality of tequilas that range all the way from the stuff they siphon out of the gas tank of a 1978 Toyota pick-up truck in Nogales to tequila that was, evidently, made from platinum plated agaves (at least if the price of a shot is to be believed).
They even have a ""tequila club""...nice! 
I used to belong to a ""tequila club"" when I was young and bulletproof...I would drink ""tequila"" (or agaves, as they call it here) until they (whoever ""they"" are) needed a club to get me back under control...I could literally fly under the influence of crazy juice:)
I decided not rejoin Cien Agaves tequila club...you should all be thanking your lucky stars:)
I hadn't been to Cien Agaves for quite a while and I am glad my sweet daughter took me there for lunch today (a euphemism...dear old dad bought, but I like to think of that as my privilege:)
No tequila today...no, it was taco Tuesday! $1.00 shredded beef tacos and $2.00 Tecate cerveza's all day long! That's what we were there to try!
So we stocked up on $1.00 tacos for lunch, right? Of course not, don't be silly...dad was buying:)
We had exactly 1 shredded beef taco (which was tasty, BTW). We had lobster tacos...(ok, but pretty salty...and if I think it was salty... baby, it was salty) we had veggie tacos, we had rice and beans. Most everything was OK to tasty and sent us off to the movies in fine style. 
The service was prompt and friendly, even though Cien Agaves was absolutely jam-packed during the lunch hour. I had no idea so many people wanted a full rack of $1.00 tacos!
Next time, I am going to see if I can eat $5.00 worth of Taco Tuesday tacos...I could do it when I was in the tequila club:)"
test_347,"I think proximity to my house is definitely going to make Maria's a go to stop in the future.

After spending waaaaaay to much money at Home Depot a few Saturday's back, we needed a filling and cheap lunch. Saw Marias and decided to give it a try.

The chips and salsa were flowing the entire time. Both of us got the $1.99 beer special. They even brought out cold mugs and limes with it, which was a plus.

The lunch menu is super inexpensive. Everything around $5-6. I got the cheese quesadilla, beans, and rice and my husband got this scrambled egg/bell peppers/onion mixture that came with tortillas, beans, and rice. Everything was pretty good. Not blow your pants off good. But, if you are looking for some typical Mexican restaurant food, this place will do the trick! 

Inexpensive, decent tasting, and great location. Winning combo!"
test_348,"I visited Beltway for the first time during the Hunt for my first Handgun at the beginning of the year. From my very first interaction with Branden, I gathered that they are more honest and forthright than several that I had visited. They are well informed but might not have answers to all your questions. However, they would help search for the proper answer rather than mislead you. 
I have bought a few guns, several accessories and a Scope from here after (offcourse) doing my due diligence. I have been extremely satisfied with all my purchases.

You can expect Friendly personnel, Reasonable prices and Great communication at Beltway."
test_349,"I'm a regular here and absolutely love this place. It's the best Mexican food I've had in such a very long time. It's family owned, and they are all very personable with their customers. They take the time to spark conversation with you while your order is being prepared--and let me just say their ingredients is so fresh! Their guacamole is my favorite as well as their Horchata. My go to dish is the Carne Asada Fries with Angus beef or their Chicken Chimichangas. You honestly can't go wrong with this establishment. I could eat here everyday. And if you have a birthday coming up, the food is on them! I always forget to go in and take advantage but I don't mind paying even if it's the day after. You want to spend a dime for great food, this is your place"
test_350,"Not normally bad service, but today makes me question what happened.

Out office orders regularly from here and again, not with many issues. We called in the order as usual, our guy picks it up, brings it back. However, we're told they are out of tots and the substituted chips. (But thanks for the BBQ sauce?) Also our guy was told they were out of multiple items. 

A) Why was this not mentioned when we called in? 
B) If it happened after the fact, why would you not call the ordering party back and offer them a choice?
C) Missing items, pickles, mayo etc.
D) No deduction in the check?

Not saying we wont go there again, but that's a bit off putting."
test_351,Loved it. Everybody was helpful and nice and our rooms were so comfortable. We didn't go to the gym or the pool but we went to the ambassadors lounge and it is so nice you wouldn't believe!
test_352,"Danielle is the most honest, hardworking and talented real estate professional I have known. Within the span of 48 hours, we prepared two separate offers on houses under quite different circumstances. In the first case, the homeowner was asking too high of a price for the location and was unable to accept our offer. Danielle was level-headed throughout the entire transaction. We discussed the pricing in great detail, she did research on the area and the history of the home, and advised me well. The second house became available immediately and was priced quite competitively and we learned there was another offer on the table. Once again, Danielle did research quickly and prepared an offer that was accepted only due to her intuitive and diligent manner. I am grateful for the experience and highly recommend Danielle to anyone looking to purchase or sell a home."
test_353,"Best Asian food in south charlotte ... Love this place! Never disappoints in serving delicious sushi and fantastic desserts ! 
Two thumbs way up !"
test_354,Very cool Viet fusion restaurant. Went here during new years eve.  The set menu was great. Also a very cool collection of Quebec craft beers. Waiters were very attentive.
test_355,We've been going here for years and the food is consistently amazing. The beef kebab is to die for and the falafel is the best I've had in a while.
test_356,"Hired them to clean 4 bed 2 bath, 1900 sq ft for a move-out. Hired 3 cleaners, they finished in 3.5 hrs and did an excellent job! It reminded me of when I first moved in. Thanks!"
test_357,"The quality of sashimi is great, fresh and taste fresh
Also as the California roll, good portion for me"
test_358,The owner was so rude and I watched him touch money and then make food without gloves or washing his hands ... disgusting
test_359,"Gyro Pita was a disappointment. The pita was hard on the edges and did not seem fresh. The sauce was very sour.  Do not order Greek Fries...they were old and soooo bad.  They used old Oreida crinkle cut fries The table was dirty and as I was eating, a fly crawled out from under the plate. 
Go to the one by Chandler Fashion or express location on Kyrene and Warner."
test_360,They had our food ready pretty quick but it was not the best had the jerk chicken and carnitas with the black beans and jerk fried rice. The beans were more runny than I like and the carnitas had no flavor. Wasn't really impressed for my first visit. May try it again and order a different combination.
test_361,"I have tried most of the hot dog vendors in the uptown area and ""The Chili Man""  is by far the best!  Also, you always get very good conversation while you wait!  What more could you ask for!"
test_362,"My bf and I were in Scottsdale for the weekend and I found Spa Lamar on yelp. After reading the positive reviews I really talked it up to him and we decided to try it.

I also read about the special on travelzoo where you can buy $130 of spa service for $65 (half off) The ad reads ""$65 - 'Best Spas in Arizona': Half Off Massage & Pool Day"" I called Spa Lamar, spoke with Taylor and asked about a couple massage and whether we can use the vouchers. Since the price of the couples massage was over the price of 2 vouchers, I asked if I can buy 3 and use the leftover money for other services. She said YES.

I went on travelzoo to buy the vouchers, the fine print said one voucher per customer so I called Spa Lamar and spoke with Taylor again. She said she would find out for sure and put me on hold. She came back on the phone and apologized and said we can only use one per person. No problem! It was still a good deal. 

I bought 2 vouchers, made the appointment for the following day at 1:00 (I had a early evening flight home.) She said 1:00 wasn't available, but she can get us in at 1:30. No problem again.

The next morning, Taylor called, she said they booked a couple's facial in our room, so we can't come in until 2:00. No problem again!! We got there about 1:50 and were shown to the locker rooms then ""relaxation room."" There were 4 women in the room drinking champagne and talking very loudly about their children, therapy, etc. You couldn't even hear the music! Now, mind you, I love a girls' day out and do it often. But, couldn't they put a party in room other than the ""relaxation room"" so everyone trying to relax don't have to listen to their conversation?

The lady (I believe the owner) came to us and told us they pride themselves on being on time, but it was 4 minutes after 2 and it would be another 5 minutes before they were ready for us. No problem!! At 2:15, she walked by us, looked at the clock and frowned. A couple of minutes later, we were called into our room.

My therapist, Karen was wonderful. She gave me one of the best massages and asked me frequently if the pressure was ok. She was the only positive thing about the place. Unfortunately, my bf felt like his deep tissue massage was just a inconsistent light rubdown. 

After our massages, we went into the steam room. It smelled musty and mildewy with about an inch of water on the floor that wasn't draining. We left and tried the jacuzzi. The pool and jacuzzi did not look very clean either.

Overall, I agree with Kimberly T. Spa Lamar feels very run down and not very clean. I was extremely disappointed. We gathered our things and went into the showers. Guess what?!?!? There was no hot water!!!!!!! I had to take a freezing cold shower. I mentioned it to the lady at the front desk when I came out and she said they had a lot of guest today and the hot water probably needed to cycle through. I told her my bf took a shower in the one next to me and his was hot!

To add insult to injury of a horrible experience, when we checked out, they couldn't figure out how to discount the travelzoo vouchers so they tried with a calculator and told us we owed an amount a lot more than we were expecting. When I tried to explain to just minus $260 (2 vouchers) from the amount owed, they said the vouchers were only good for $110 each, not $130!!! The other $20 was for yoga classes. I explained the ad said 50% off $130 value and they insisted it was not all towards massages and the voucher was only good for a one hour massage which is $110. They said it would be the last time they advertised through travelzoo. 

I told them of my experience starting with misinformation about the voucher the day before to the appointment time, then the cold shower and they asked what I thought was right. I told them to simply honor the voucher as it is advertised!

All in all, it was a horrible and costly experience at a run down place. I will never go back again."
test_363,Great food here for sure especially the tuna sandwich..I always have lunch here when I have the time and the atmosphere is great ..love sitting outside and enjoying the view. ......
test_364,"Tried the tamales, they are awesome. Not quite as good as homemade, but they beat El Toro by a long shot. I'm sad I only ordered one. 

Delivery times are not great. I once waited over an hour for it to get to me. I don't think it is unacceptable though, as they only have one driver and deliver to all of Champaign and Urbana. Overall, picking it up is so much faster but either way I think it is worth it. I've never gotten cold food or a messed up order."
test_365,"Tourist trap of super cutesy mainstream items!

Friends and I grabbed a quick snack from here - ice cream sandwiches! Their ice cream and cookie selection was decent and service was nice. The butterfingers ice cream I had was delicious - the chocolate chip cookies sandwiching the ice cream were ok (not chewy...boo).

Sugar Factory is definitely a different scene from the rest of Vegas, but still fun."
test_366,"This might be the best Mexican food in the Pittsburgh area. Totally authentic, and the prices are great, too. I guess I'll be driving up to NK more often."
test_367,"Why should you come here for your asian grocery needs?

1. The place is cleannnn. When you compare this place to the other asian supermarkets in town *cough* 99 Ranch, this place gets a A++ from the health inspector. 

2. Large selection of fruits, vegetables, seafood and just your overall asian spices, sauces, and snacks. This also includes everything you need for a korean style feast : marinated meats (bulgogi, galbi), fresh made kimchi, soft tofu, every type of ban chan available, krn chili powder etc etc. and everything is at a reasonable price.

3. This place comes with a fully loaded food court. Too hungry to shop and make your own korean dishes at home? No worries! This place provides just about every korean dish your heart desires."
test_368,"I've been to Littlefish twice so far.  The first time I got a 2 eggs with sausage combo, and the 2nd time I got the eggs benny.

The food here tastes healthy and fresh.  The hollandaise sauce on the benny had a nice lemony taste to it and it's a welcome change considering some place's poached eggs taste like vinegar.

Portions are big, imho, and both times I had items on the plate that I couldn't finish.

Prices could be a couple of dollars lower (It's $14 for a two-egg, peameal bacon benny and homefries) but considering that it's in a more low traffic area, it seems reasonable for a neighbourhood that's slowly but surely gentrifying.

Wait staff is super friendly! No complaints there.

Would def. return whenever I feel like heading into the Junction."
test_369,"Seriously, JR's fish and chips? Try JR's Fish Sticks and Fries.  You are better off saving some money and going to the Fry's across the street and buying frozen pre-battered fish, and frozen fries."
test_370,"We both enjoyed our starters, which were the Crispy taquitos and the Avocado eggrolls! YUM! 

I had the Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp, which was good. The plantains were great! Crispy and spicy on the outside and smooth and creamy inside! My companion had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, but he ordered it with brown rice instead. He didn't like it so much. There was too much rice! 

Our server lacked enthusiasm and was sub par really. 

We got cheesecake to go. I had the Kahlua Cocoa Coffee and he had the Oreo. Both were creamy and delicious!"
test_371,"I came here a few years ago, sat outside and ate a wonderful meal. But last night was not so great. It was VERY disappointing. We had the ""table d'h√¥te"" with soup, mango salad, spring roll, rice and our main dish. It cost 45$ for 2 and was not worth the price. 

The soup (Tom Yum) was good; good flavours, but the ingredients inside it where cheap compared to the amazing soup I had years ago. It contained coarsely chopped tomatoes and mushrooms with frozen not fresh shrimp.

The mango salad was OK; mangos where not ready to be eaten yet, but it's hard to ripen mangos to the point where they aren't too mushy.

The roll was good; crispy and fresh but the dipping sauce had a strong after taste that wasn't very pleasing... you'll see why soon

My main dish was #2. Marinated garlic chicken with thai sauce served with peppers and onions. The chicken was good, a little dry, but good. It's plain chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce. Was not expecting that from the menu's description. Here's where it gets DISGUSTING : the thai sauce was made with minced garlic you can get in jars, the taste was absolutely repulsive. It was in the spring roll dipping sauce too, but the taste was way less imposing than the garlic thai sauce. The ""peppers and onions"" where 2 tiny pieces on top of the chicken.

My spouse had the pad thai with was VERY good.

All and all, the food is OK, the price you pay is not worth what you get on your plate, the ingredients are cheap, I will not be going back to this restaurant."
test_372,"Amazing food and beer selection. The bar tender Celeste was awesome. I had bangers and mash, which was bangin'. It was so cool to find a legit Irish pub in Charlotte."
test_373,"Excellent service from the time of booking to the completion of the job. Booking was super-easy via their website. They called ahead of the appointment, showed up on time, provided a very fair estimate for the job, then returned on time to complete the job; was able to pay via credit card...This really couldn't have been an easier transaction. We tried a couple other places before turning to Junk King, but didn't get timely call-backs, had missed appointments, etc."
test_374,"Love the tacos queso!  Yes, the QUESO is important!  Great atmosphere and sides.  Fantastic fajitas!"
test_375,"What a cool find! I had been trying to think of something new to try today and just by chance ended up at Beechwood Mall. I am so glad I did! 
Pastativo located in the food court upstairs, is not your ordinary food court meal. Pastativo is the latest in eateries to try and take a ""chipotle-esqe"" approach to how you order your meal. But in my opinion, they do it much, much better! 
You can choose your sauce, choose your type of pasta, choose the size bowl you want... The smaller portion limits you to 5 veggies or additions to your sauce and the regular size gives you unlimited. You may add chicken, meatballs or shrimp for an extra cost. 
I chose the regular size with their TIVO sauce. This is a marinara/Alfredo mix of a sauce that is a rich and flavorful combo. I chose penne for the pasta and added chicken for $2 more. For my additions I had mozzarella,  and parmesan cheese. You could also have added bell peppers red peppers, mushrooms, you name it they had it! Fresh tomatoes, broccoli, etc. they cook your dish to order so it did take it about 5 minutes to cook but it was worth the wait. I made mine into a combo with a breadstick and a drink. The breadstick you do not want to pass up. It's a lightly toasted breadstick with garlic butter and Parmesan on top... And mozzarella in the middle.  I loved dipping it in the sauce with my meal. 
I had originally planned to only eat half and go back for dessert. They had a lovely looking Tiramisu but I was too full! I will have to have it next time! 
I made it a point to go back and thank the staff and I am glad I did! Chef Dee and the gang loved hearing how much I enjoyed dinner and Rachel told me they would soon be starting their own food truck! I hope they will be at Walnut Wednesday's because I know they will be a huge hit! (But they better stick around in Beechwood too -- I would miss them!) 

Check them out!"
test_376,"Great, great ambiance!  the bartenders were super attentive and gave generous drink portions -- yay!!!!"
test_377,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was in great walking distance to JCU and conveniently located. The food was fresh and made well. My favorite was the walnut salad. This salad was amazing. If you like great tasting food and want the best breakfast, brunch, or lunch of your life, try this place."
test_378,"Came here for lunch and ordered a chicken leg with chimichurri sauce and a mac and cheese. Generally not that busy during the lunch hour, and this place has a great patio for a nice summer day.

Admittedly the chicken leg portion was a bit small, visually at least, but reasonable for $5. When coupled with the very heavy and savoury mac and cheese it adds up to a satisfying meal. Chicken was well marinated and moist on the inside.Plus the chicken is naturally raised without hormones or antibiotics. Maybe just pure marketing but at least it makes me feel healthy when eating it.

Mac and cheese was a slightly more mature mac and cheese. Came in a cute mini staub casserole dish. The cheese did not feel cheap, nor was it too salty or greasy. I think they did a good job making a traditionally very heavy dish feel slightly less heavy.

Overall I really like this place as a lunch spot. Not sure I'm fond of the menu structure though. For example while a salad at flock looks affordable, you have to remember you pay for the chicken as an add-on. As a result things can still get pricier than you imagine fairly easily. On the plus side though they have many mini sides which means it is great for sharing!"
test_379,"I can not say enough great things about this place.  I am a long distance runner and cyclist.  But I am nursing a running injury at this time.  I knew I needed to find a place to give me the ""high"" I get from running, so I researched many gyms and after many visits to different ones I chose to try the Strength Center.  I came here with my fianc√© to check out the place and we were greeted by Adam (the owner) who gave us a little try of what we would experience here and ... Oh my gosh! Butt kick! I had my heart rate at close to MHR.  After that little sample we decided to join and it's been awesome, painfully fun workouts that get my heart rate up so high I love it!  I join the class every chance I get.  All the instructors are great.  This is the place for hard core people that love to suffer to achieve great strength and happy hormones.  Highly recommended!"
test_380,Great place to chill and enjoy breakfast on a Sunday. We had the lemon drop with lemon curd. We will return on a Sunday.
test_381,"I was really worried about tooth sensitivity since I've tried (and was never able to finish) about every home teeth whitening system available and always felt excruciating pain with every breath of air that passed over my teeth afterwards! But based on other reviews I gave it a shot and couldn't be happier! My teeth got 5-6 shades whiter and the process was painless. I needed a couple Advil later on that evening but the next day, no sensitivity at all! I can't stop smiling I would eat something fairly close to your appointment because it takes two hours and then you can't eat for two hours after that. I sprayed my teeth with my Waterpic before heading in and didn't have any issues. Treat yourself to a younger smile! You'll be glad you did! At least I sure am! Thank you True Teeth Whitening! I'll be back for maintenance every 6-12 months because I love these results!"
test_382,"Michael's catering handled the bar service for our wedding and we could not have been happier with their impeccable service! Their bartenders (Teri & Jerry I believe) were incredibly friendly and anticipated our needs before we could ask for anything. They kept our drinks and all of our guests drinks replenished at all times and everyone was extremely pleased by the great drinks, fabulous staff and lack of lines throughout the night. I could not recommend hiring their company more (I recently had their delicious food at a friends' wedding- and we were all raving at how amazing everything was). SO impressed and hope to drink and dine with them again very soon! They made our wedding very special and fun!"
test_383,"I am so torn with this place as another poster has said. The wait time are great, the front desk staff is wonderful, most of the time the nurses are good, which is the reason for the 2 stars. Last night was a different story. 

The nurse was literally asking me questions as I was attempting to finish his previous one. He was walking out the door as I was still talking. I couldn't believe it. And they weren't busy, like at all. We got in and into a room in less than 10 minutes. We've been a few times and the last two times have been seen by Dr Young. He is awful. My 4 year old has been coughing violently for a week (something we've been dealing with on and off for months). I explained to him that we saw the pediatrician yesterday morning, but that things had gotten worse since coming home. Hence why we are here! He cut me off in the middle of my sentences, made me feel about as stupid as I possibly could, and wouldn't listen to me when I told him everything he currently suggested WAS NOT WORKING. When I asked about a cough syrup for my son (he is coughing to the point of making himself throw up, which I stated) he laughed. He laughed at me, then proceeded to tell me that doctors don't do that sort of thing anymore. I was practically begging for something to make my son comfortable, and he wouldn't listen. 

He ordered an x-ray, which let us know my son had some chest inflammation going on. No kidding! He's violently coughing and complaining his chest hurts. Groundbreaking! He gave my son a teeny, tiny shot of a liquid steroid last night in the room, and they failed to put what he was given or how much on his discharge papers. Currently waiting until they open so I can call and confirm what he was given. We were sent home with an inhaler with the same medication he's been using at home, after I explained that its not working. 

IDK if I will come back to this location. Dr. Young is truly a piece of work, and I can't understand why he is a children's doctor of all things. If you can come and request a different doctor, your experience should be better."
test_384,"This is by far the poorest excuse for sushi! We happened to be on this side of town and by the other reviews and it being rated 4 stars we thought it was a safe choice.....I was wrong!!! I eat sushi because I like raw FRESH fish. I do not like rolls with deep fried fish, with imitation or fake substitute ingredients, and garnished with 2 oz of spicy mayo. They do not have more than 3 or 4 rolls that don't have some sort of tempura, deep fried, or ""krab"" mix. So the food alone will be reason enough for me to never go back. The service mirrored the food. We had to ask for everything (ex. Ginger, wasabi, soy sauce, refills, check) It got to the point where we felt like we couldn't bother or ask them for anything else. For the price we were charged I could have had sushi at a 5 star restaurant. Being an ex bartender/server I couldn't not tip, but was very hard to tip. DO NOT GO HERE!"
test_385,"This location really creases me.  They need a separate line for returns and/or online order pickups.  They never have enough checkout lines open to handle the customer demand. Store experiences like these remind me why I order everything online and have it shipped to my house. I recently ordered a pair of pajamas on the Target web site for in-store pickup. I got it home only to discover I received two different sizes for the shirt and pants.  So I had to go back in the store to return them, and while I was there, of course their system was down. Technology and Target do not coexist.  What a pain in the ass.  Even Wal-Mart has self-checkout. Get on board, Target.  Thank god for Amazon.com is all I can say..."
test_386,"We have visited this restaurant 3 times so far, and each time it's been awesome! The food is consistently tasty and fresh (and I am a picky foodie and nutritionist) and healthy, the servers just the right touch of helpful and friendliness. Highly, highly recommended. 

p.s. the last visit did leave us with the impression that the portions were a bit smaller than before, but we were pleasantly satisfied (without dessert even) so that's not a bad thing!"
test_387,"Came for the $5 breakfast, but there wasn't any.
Food was still good.
I ordered something simple;
Eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast.
My boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros and I wish I would've ordered that instead.
It was filled with flavor. 
Our waitress kept checking up on us.
I would recommend this place."
test_388,The WHOLE hotel smelled like a spa. This was an awesome hotel experience and I will definitely be returning. Be sure to go to the burger bar.
test_389,"Always loved their food, I hadn't been for a few years though  so I decided to take my hubbby there for dinner.
Food was good but customer service was terrible. Manager was a complete ***hole and we don't plan on ever going back."
test_390,"I did a lot of online shopping and had decided on a pre-owned Corolla that I found at Right Toyota for a great price. Gerry Espinoza in the internet department had initially reached out to me about the car. But when I arrived to test drive, Gerry had already left for the day. So Isaac Bunitsky stepped up and went out of his way to assist me with the exact car I was looking to purchase, no BS. The paperwork took an unusual amount of time because of my situation, and Isaac was keeping me updated via text just about every day. When I came to pick up my car and Isaac was not in, Gerry and Jason Murdoch were so quick to help complete the process and get me out the door, all while keeping it fun. Even Nancy at the front desk makes you feel right at home. I really appreciate the teamwork here and intend on working with the Right Toyota team for future purchases."
test_391,"There aren't nearly as many good sandwich shops in Vegas as there should be, but Capriotti's is pretty good.  I like most of their sandwiches, and the prices aren't ridiculous."
test_392,"Clam was good and hearty after eating a bowl ($8) I was full, I didn't have much space for the shrimp jambalaya we ordered. I'm glad me and my husband shared.  Overall great service, very attentive and our server Cookie was a sweetheart"
test_393,"Late night staff (sometimes day time as well) clearly don't care about proper customer service. They are always on their phones, talking to each other, and not professional at all. 

Also what is the point of paying for the ""black card service"" when they let ANYONE use the massage chairs and tanning machines. They don't check for the passes nor clean the machines after uses (tanning beds)

It's a great spot, and well lit space, but common, the staff should be more professional. 

The general manager should be aware of this, and the franchise owner should be as well. 

Cheers."
test_394,"This isn't a review so much as it is a love letter...

Chou's Kitchen saved my roommate Megan T. and I from dying of homesickness for a full summer in Arizona by providing DELICIOUS AND AUTHENTIC Chinese food.

The dishes here are SO ON POINT and prices are super reasonable, even compared to Bay Area prices :) 

MUST GET DISHES:
- Stir-Fry Eggplant & Minced Pork with Garlic Sauce: Guys. This dish is EVERYTHING. The Szechuan-style sauce is so flavorful and goes really well with rice. Like, too well with rice....because I end up eating too much and feeling regret mixed with immense satisfaction.
- Dry Green Beans with Pork: The green beans have the PERFECT amount of bite to them
- Spicy Cold Noodle With Cucumber: Mouth-numbing Ma-La goodness that's extra amazing on a hot day. Beware, though, if you're afraid of spicy oil, this is not the dish for you.

I will say, though, that the various baos and dumplings they serve here are just okay. The xiao long baos are quite small, but still pack a good amount of soup in them. I would skip the sheng jian baos - the skin to filling ratio is way too high!

I'll end by saying that my roommate and I ordered at least 4 dishes for the two of us each time we went to ensure that we had enough leftovers to last us well into the week. If that's not love, I don't know what is. Chou's, you will be missed when I move out of AZ!"
test_395,Went here to buy 5 Phoenix open tickets. Matt was a very nice and couldn't of been more polite and helpful with everything I talked to him about. I told him I recently got a new driver and he said that k can come by anytime to test it out on their simulator. I actually had it in my car and he gave me advice on some of the flaws in my swing for 30 minutes. I was averaging about 300 yards. Once I took some of his advice I got on up to 335. Huge help!
test_396,Everything I try here is delicious.  The egg fu young is the best I have had in comparison to other restaurants.  Customer service is always great here
test_397,"Yummy, traditional style Asian desserts!
I tried a creamy mango dessert with coconut milk, and a red bean sago.
Both were not overly sweet, and tasted fresh and healthier than a traditional dessert.
Service was quick, and the place was quite busy with others eating and chatting."
test_398,Love this place!  The lunch buffet is delicious and worth the money.  Inexpensive Maki rolls so that you can try several kinds without spending a fortune.
test_399,"Man. I have eaten here twice and haven't been disappointed. We usually try to come here before a show at the filmore because it is so close and we get sick of the restaurants right by the venue! This time around we got the meat and cheese plate which had a lemon pistachio salami on it (omg-I want more), cherry lamb lollipops, deviled eggs, porkbelly (holy moly this was the best! Crispy, crunchy, sweet and savory), and potato croquettes. We also tried a salty dog and the mucho gusto cocktail. No complaints and a super cute place! Go!"
test_400,"I'm a sucker for piano bars so I had to come here. However, I'll pass on the open mic. Ruins the ambience and some people don't give up the mic. This place was pretty empty when we came but the pianist was great. Drinks were strong so that was a plus. Would come back to grab a few drinks before venturing out to the neighboring bars but wouldn't stay very long here."
test_401,"I needed a large truck after purchasing a new set of furniture, so I went to Adens Hay Oasis, aka U-Haul, on Williamsfield.

The kid behind the counter, a local cowboy (no joke), was helpful in making sure they had a truck for us the next day. I got there early the next morning before they were open. After waiting a few minutes for the 2 kids to set out the horse and pig feed (next to the chicken coop in the parking lot) outside for the day, I was helped a few minutes early and sent on my way. The truck I received was in excellent shape (for a moving truck), and actually enjoyable to drive. Returning the truck was quick and painless. Now I know where to go locally for a quick moving truck..... and also pot belly pig feed, spurs, and horse accessories."
test_402,"I have been in this spot lots of times and started out having a great time, but lately it has been tense and not that great. Friday was the final straw. I never enjoy watching someone in charge yell at an employee. I sat at the bar and watched the bartender/manager tell the poor servers that she was refusing to make their drinks because they were stealing her glasses. It was ridiculous. I come to have fun, not be made uncomfortable at someone else's expense. I hope this bar has not run its course because it has potential."
test_403,Great resort to stay. We were here for 2 days. They provided us delicious breakfast for 2 days delivered to the room. This place had 2 swimming pools and jacuzzi. Internet speed was good. Had great time here because it is in the center of the Vegas strip.
test_404,"Went in for the first time and was more than impressed. The atmosphere was hip and inviting. The staff there was friendly, especially Don behind the Sushi Bar. The Sushi was the best I've ever had and I look forward to when I can go back. Ninja!!!"
test_405,"Food is decent. Service is ok. Nothing to rave about but if you want to watch sports, this is the place to be"
test_406,"Great roasted beet salad with goat cheese and spiced walnut, flat bread buffala and tomatoes and chocolate mousse and caramel, very good and a nice surprise as an airport restaurant."
test_407,"Pizza was good. I loved how cheap it all was. My bf and I went here for lunch one day and got a medium wheat crust with vegan mozzarella cheese basil and spinach! It was so good! We also got French fries with parmesan cheese. Super filling, I think the total came up to about $20. Decently priced I would say. Very nice friendly staff! I had a great waiter! Was actually dead when we got there though, we were the only ones, which made it kind of fun but I'm sure it gets relatively busy there! I would deff go back for some healthy pizza!"
test_408,"I always take Hertz and the Hertz station at McCarran Airport is great. The shuttle takes you to the Rent a Car garage and from there the Hertz sign is in big bright letters to the right. Being Hertz #1 Gold, you do not even have to wait in line. Your car is waiting for you with your name in lights big board. You hop in and drive off. Can't get much simpler than that."
test_409,"We found Everly to be SOSOSO disappointing! The vegetable dishes we ordered were served lukewarm. The  brussel sprouts were very flavorful but the others didn't hit the mark.  The shaved salad was inedible (someone in the kitchen must be obsessed with radishes) , though the salmon on top was delicious. The cauliflower casserole was also lukewarm and bland. The butternut squash casserole‚Äã was very tasty with a delightful crunch. The salmon entree was served way after the other entrees; poor timing.
The place was clean and the servers were pleasant.
All in all, we miss Bluphies and won't be rushing back to dine here."
test_410,"Pretty standard Mexican fast food. Super greasy, spicy, etc. 

I had the chile relleno, it was better than Filibertos but still kinda just meh. 

The salsa bar looked like it could use a little more attention. There were no cucumbers and the red and green sauce were all mixed up.

I liked the lettuce, pico mix up thing they had there. :)

There was some construction going on in the parking lot and some construction worker kinda yelled at us for parking in front of the restaurant... If they don't want people to park there they should probably put some cones up or something...

I'll eat there again if I'm near."
test_411,"A great down home style steak house! It's an iconic Vegas restaurant, located off of the beaten path. The tables and chairs reminded me of childhood, the old wooden spindle style. The grill that they make the steaks on is right out in the open so you can watch. The steak comes with a nice smoky charred flavor. I tried the scallops in cream sauce, and it was very good. The scallops were fresh and cooked properly, not chewy at all. They were very busy, but the waitress was very attentive. The prices were very reasonable for a steak house."
test_412,"I have been frequenting Fresh on Spadina for over a year now; unfortunately, out of convenience. 

I will not be back because of a few reasons:

1. The service is not good. The staff seem to have an attitude  - I know it's a tuff industry, but you would expect a 'fresh' experience when you're there, especially due to the price you pay. In fact, after ordering takeout salads for a year, I went to sit down on the outside patio and was swept off by a server who said they could only do full service. She didn't ask if i wanted to order a drink or anything more, just a back-handed go. Not good, especially when their were plenty of seats available. What's with that?

2. The prices are not reasonable. You can go to Fresh 11 across the street and get a better salad, more filling and for less. E.g: the salmon salad. No, I do not work for them and am not in the restaurant industry.

3. Wait times. Wait times can be very bad if you are in a rush for lunch, or want a quick bite before a movie or drinks with friends. Depending on the time of day, expect long delays. It can also be very loud - not exactly a great place for a date. 

Overall, the food isn't bad, but the service is horrible. WIth a few adjustments, I'm hoping Fresh can recover. I think it would take one other solid sit-down type vegetarian restaurant with good service to really impact Fresh's service."
test_413,"Comparing Drai's to Omnia, where we went our first night, is like night and day. We are in town for a bachelorette for a friend and are all in our 30's. 
The staff at Drai's is awesome! They ALL smiled, were very friendly and don't have a humongous ego on their back. The music was amazing and I danced the night away like I did at my wedding three years ago. I am def. coming back:)"
test_414,"5 stars for a very smooth transaction with Darlene. Very approachable & accommodating to all my queries. Had our wedding in Las Vegas 3 months ago. Darlene was exceptional. She delivered our cake in our reception even if it's miles away from her bakery. I loved what she did to our cake. Showed her some pegs too but her creation was better. I'm glad I found her here in Yelp! Otherwise, I could've encountered a major hassle during our wedding day lol!

Thank you so much for your sweetness, Darlene!"
test_415,We love goldfish swim school. My one daughter has been in lesson since she was 2 1/2. My other daughter started at six months is it now in the mini one class. The teachers are consistent and wonderful with the children.
test_416,Came to Border Grill for my sisters Bachelorette and it was a fun time with the girls but the food was ok!!! Service was slow maybe we got there late and staff was over us also it took forever to get water hello am hungover!!! The food I think had great balance and lovely presentation but the rice was hard and cold and so was my tortillas very cold. I ate and didn't complain I was starving probably won't go back.
test_417,All of the staff members are so sweet and the tanning rooms are very clean! Loving it so far!
test_418,"Really good pizza with a touch of New York decor.  Lively place (was completely packed for Friday lunch).  This is definitely not your typical take-out pizza, and I'd certainly call it a step above many similar businesses.  Great for a quick meal or business lunch.

The only negative thing I have to say is that they over-charged for what I ordered and then forgot part of my meal.  They were, however, apologetic and corrected their error as soon as I pointed it out.

If you're taking a group of people, probably best to keep it around 6 max as they don't have tons of large tables."
test_419,We have been very pleased with Irwin's. Carl is great and does a fabulous job.  We routinely get our bikes tuned up there and he always goes above and beyond.
test_420,This was our first time here which makes me nervous but we've found our new groomer!  I got an appointment Saturday morning with only a week's notice and my Pablo was so calm and content when I picked him up.  He looked and smelled like a little gentleman!
test_421,"This place truly is a dive. Don't let the TV show distort the meaning: dives are sh#@ holes. Place was filthy, had to wash my own fork with ice and a napkin before eating. Asked for an egg white omelet with extra crispy hashbrowns; Very bland eggs (it looked spiced but didn't taste like it, must have been old dried out spices that lost all flavor) and hashbrowns (obviously frozen) were still raw in the middle. Add in the decor looks like my great grandmother vomited the 50s all over the walls, and it was quite an unpleasant experience for me at least. The one redeeming quality (hence 2 stars not 1) was the wait staff were very nice, helped to sort out the menu for my mother who couldn't read the specials board, and the waitress was quick to refill drinks and bring over hot sauces to add on the food, which were desperately needed. I personally won't return, but my mother enjoyed it. Take the retiree's without taste buds here for a trip down memory lane. ""Oh look, a rotary phone you talk into the wall with, we had one of those when gas was a nickel!"" Sure ma.......Sure......"
test_422,"Moved to the area recently and needed to transfer my house into a trust deed. Had tried  to make contact with a few recommended attorneys but never got a call back. It was a simple task, and I found it quite humorous that I could not get a call back. I called Nicole's office and was able to get to her directly. Told her my needs and she was on it! Very professional and bright person. She expedited the matter efficiently and expertly. Although my estate trust matters have already been set up, I would never hesitate to use her or recommend her for anything. I appreciate it when an attorney can pay the needed attention in a timely manner. I find that rare."
test_423,"I've visited the grocery store a few times and I was pleased with the quality of the products. My favorites are their crab cakes and coffee. 

I've been wanting to visit their wine bar for a while and finally got the chance to do so. Again great quality products, but the experience was very poor. I was really disappointed. I'm sitting at the bar and there is another person eating, drinking, having a good time. Next thing I know...he is behind the bar working!! :D He continued drinking and it became apparent that he was drunk. The other employees were friendly but not very educated on what was available. The wines here are Italian...yet every time they compared them to French wines. They would benefit from training. 

Additionally, they were not clear with my friends about the wine tasting samples when they said they had never visited before. ""I can give you samples of whatever you want!"" Oh, but she failed to mention it's a $2 charge per sample which they didn't even let my friend finish! The constant staring from them was also a nice touch. 

While the grocery store is nice, I would not recommend the wine bar."
test_424,came back to Pittsburgh for a wedding and couldn't find anything in my price range close to the city until i found this motel...it was very affordable....room was okay...cable tv and a/c worked fine....
test_425,Love the bibimbap station. They have lots of choices for meat also. The service was great. The guy helping us always kept my drink glass full and changed the grill when needed. The used plates were always picked up quickly. We have eaten at other Korean BBQ places but like this place more. We will be back.
test_426,this place is a must visit and experience. there fully staffed with barbers who all have different skills but from what i saw and experienced today. its truly a craft that there blessed with and it shows from the amount of business flowing through the doors all ages. i went today and brought a friend and some family here and we all left feeling like new people this will be my new offical way to spend my saturday morning/evening. good people with great vibes and family orientated. football always on tv's around the shop and sometimes they bbq as well in addition to selling some good hair products and hard to find retro air jordans. rich got my taper all around just righti will be back
test_427,Diana and Miguel just made my day!! Nicest people and fabulous team!! I will be back :)
test_428,"Nicky is my hero! I hope that when you have an email related issue, changing from PC to a MAC, and from outlook to apple mail, and want good conversations about EDC, or perhaps need a roommate, you get him. Sigh....   :-)

Well now that Nicky is gone and moved over to the Aria Hotel, Devin is my new 'go to guy'.  :-)"
test_429,"We went about 3:15 and missed lunch, but it was absolutely awesome.  The best we have found since moving to Charlotte 4 months ago.  Food was somewhat slow coming out but worth the wait.
We will be making this our family Mexican Restaurant to eat when we go out."
test_430,Kennedy tile installed tile throughout most of our house. Brian was prompt and professional. The installation was done on time with careful attention to every detail. I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome. Highly recommended!
test_431,"First time eating at this restaurant.  Back east we have a similar burger joint called five guys, In-N-Out is far superior. The dining area was immaculate,  it was jam packed, so the staff did a great job making sure everything stayed clean and well stocked. Employees were very friendly.  Living on the east coast we really aren't used to being greeted with a smile and a hello. So it was nice to see young kids with manners. I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were.  We fed 4 adults and 2 teenagers for under $50. Everyone left full and satisfied.  We will definitely be back."
test_432,"Had the crepe and chocolate souffl√© here!  Both delish - The chocolate souffl√© especially was outstanding!!  Very fluffy and went well with the ice cream!  Our server was very helpful and the restaurant overall was pleasant and nice to lounge around after dinner.  This place is known for the C'Wow, which is the chocolate dome over ice cream and a waffle, and they serve it by pouring hot caramel over the dome so it melts and collapses, exposing the ice cream waffle underneath.  I'm not a fan of caramel so I didn't order it, but it was very entertaining to watch them serve this signature dish to the table next to us!

Would def come back and recommend others to come!"
test_433,"We were looking for a good sushi stop on a work trip to Phoenix, and let me tell you, over 800 reviews didn't lie! This was a very good sushi spot, fish was awesome, seaweed salad was delicious, and pricing was reasonable. Would stop here again for sure!"
test_434,"Having gone to CWRU for school, I've had the opportunity to taste many of the different pizza joints around university circle.  For overall experience, Valentino's cannot be beat.  It is a local place that has been around for decades and offers delicious pizzas, sandwiches, and dinners.  My personal favorites include white pizza with artichoke and mushrooms, the rigatoni parmesan dinner, and the meatball subs.  

If you are in University Circle and are looking for great pizza, Valentino's is the best choice."
test_435,"WOW I can't explain how great of a show this is!!! At first I was concerned this show will ruin my love to the beatles, but no!!!! This show did not in any way shame the beatles name"
test_436,"This place gives buffets a good name. The food is always fresh and interesting. The breakfast and brunch are possibly the best in Las Vegas. The Friday and Saturday night gourmet dinner buffet, is unreal. Try Beef Wellington, Venison and Steak Tartar just to name a few."
test_437,Overrated!!! Overpriced!!! Very few vegan options. Get with the times.  Just wondering when the craze will die down. We have way better Canadian restos.
test_438,"Green curry with pork
Penang

Fine ingredients, decently small sized dishes and attentive service.  We'll be back.  

Bf gave the Penang a 5 but I thought the green curry was better.  I don't like pork but the pork in the green curry was really yummy and I wouldn't change a thing."
test_439,"This was the most horrible experience. I am an avid restaurant goer and haven't had a BAD experience in a very long time, until now. We finished our meal. Waiter never checked on us mid way.  At the end, I had to go up to the desk and ask for the check. Took us 1 hr to cash out. No Rhyme or reason - we were not a bothersome table. My family of four ate, didn't ask for anything. We told the waiter at the beginning of our order that we needed Spring Rolls at the end. We finished our meal for a good 15 minutes before I had to walk up there myself.  Why did it take us 1 hour to cash out?  Because they suck at telling us our additional to go order of an appetizer was too hard to fulfill because they are out of spring rolls.

That's just dumb. One hour to cash out. Very poor service. The food was good. Average good food. But I will never come back to Jenni Pho again. I don't care how ""creative"" that name sounds."
test_440,The grape leaves were terrible!! All of the rice was hard and crunchy!! The baklava was ok.. The pita and Babaganoush was really good though..
test_441,"Ye be warned, it gets crowded at peak times. Large parties like to go there.

Pros: set up is good. Staff is friendly. Plates were cleared quickly. Server even went to find my mom a cracker for her crab. Good options. Dessert was yummy. Lots of tiny portions so you can try a lot. The peach/mango trifle thing is the bees knees. Prime rib was juicy and cooked right. Not fall apart texture, which for a roast it should be, but close. Wine and beer included in fee.

Cons: bathrooms. None! They are outside in the casino. Kid almost peed her pants before we got there. Mind you, the walk is short for an adult. Potatoes had ZERO flavor. That's hard to do. Even just a little salt is ok. Mac n cheese was old and cold. Potatoes wedges were burnt. Steamed rice was old and crunchy. I waited for 10 minutes for someone at the Asian station to replace it, but it was like a ghost town. 

All in all, it's not awful food. But $40 per person is loony toons for what you get. If you aren't eating steak, lobster, or crab, save your pennies."
test_442,Worst Walmart customer service ever. I ordered for pick up at this location (Biggest mistake of my life). Called their phone number for the pick up and no one picked up. An customer service manager came to assist me and she sent out the most useless worker to back to get my order. Believe it or not it took her 40 minutes to get my item while I was standing the whole time. AVOID THIS WALMART AT ALL COSTS GO TO THE ONE IN KEELE AND LAWRENCE.
test_443,"This pizza is awesome, definitely recommend if you are looking for something quick to sit down and eat. The pizza is a great price (for Vegas) and you could split it between 2 people as long as your not starving."
test_444,Used to come to this place all the time lately the Staff became extremely rude and in professional because I asked for a new needle because the dude came around with a bucket with it already semi opened. The needles sticking halfway out the protective plastic and since they refused to give me a new needle I walked out they literally were arguing trying to stick me with the needle that was already opened stay away. I Then caught them laughing about it like they think it's a joke this is very serious I'm going to report to Health department
test_445,Once I got a haircut from Yanira I haven't gone anywhere else. Always a pleasure going here!
test_446,"Put in for pick up at 530, come at 545 still wait 10 minutes for my order to come out.  
Get home just to find out they Forget to put to items in the bag.  I head back, and I wait another 12 minutes for the remaining items.  While waiting another party came in who was missing take out items. 
While the food is good, with 4 people working and only one table occupied, they need to get it together.  I have no time or patience for people who cannot do their job correctly.  There are other places in town that have employees that can read a receipt and put food in a bag.  Go elsewhere."
test_447,"Short Review

The Wild Leak Pizza was great although the crust is somewhat burnt which I don't like. Plus it cost like $13 bucks so its not as expensive considering the pizza is cooked in a wood oven at the back of the restaurant that is also a open kitchen. 

The atmosphere was alright considering I went here late at night, the booze really complimented it. For a steamwhistle/beer its about $5 dollars which its an average rate of pricing in Toronto. 

The service was friendly but I didn't like when my server, Jesse (I think) called me a ""little man"" which was really rude."
test_448,Good coffee- enjoyed my soy latte. Got the veggie scramble it was good but on the small side for the price.
test_449,"RIPPED OFF. Our lunch here today was the worst dining experience we've had in Calgary. Our $15 chicken donburi bowl was literally white rice and three slices of chicken. Additionally the Bento Box we ordered had dry fish on the sushi and the edamame was soggy and brown (not crisp, green or fresh). The salmon teriyaki consisted of three quarter-sized pieces of fish. For a $30 meal it looked like $5 worth of ingredients. We raised our concerns about the value and were told by staff that ""we understand the portions are not fair, but we can't do anything about it."" What kind of customer service is that?? There was no attempt to offer us a discount or side item. Overall we felt extremely ripped off. Also, the quality was questionable - which is something you shouldn't be thinking about when eating raw fish! With so many other restaurant options in Calgary, we highly recommend going elsewhere. We will NEVER be returning."
test_450,"My girlfriend and I, both Koreans, went here for two straight days while we were in Vegas.  We were very happy with their service and food.  

First day, we had ""Kal Nang"" which is the Kal Bi and Nang Myun (cold noodles) combo.  Also, we got Kim Chi Jji gae, which has pork belly in there.  Their portions were huge including side dishes.  Their side dishes were very refreshing and well done.

Second day, we had deun jang jji gae (Korean miso soup) and bi bim nang myun (spicy cold noodles).  Once again, dishes were excellent.  This place has really good nang myun... bi bim nang myun is a spicy dish, so be aware...

I didn't try any Hawaiian style dishes, but I'd certainly try one next time I'm in Vegas.

Liked:
tasty food
huge portion
side dishes (also huge portion)
great friendly service
what else can you ask for?"
test_451,"This place was really wonderful. Ate here for the first time today and will definitely be back. I had the Cuban with sweet potato fries and a salad (THAT SALAD) and couldn't even finish I was so full. My friend got the Kaya burger and it was HUGE! It looked delicious and I will definitely be trying that the next time I go back.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere and everyone I talked to was very friendly. I wish I had caught the name of our waitress today because she was awesome! (Waitress, we talked about my scarf from Thailand. You were great!)"
test_452,"Such great food and EXCELLENT SERVICE! Jenna took great care of us today. When it's so hot outside customers appreciate kindness and need it even more. I had the fish and chips...large portions (enough for 2 people but I'll be having thr rest later for sure). The fish was light, flaky and DELICIOUS! Their fries are perfect to y'all."
test_453,"Total Crossfit pros!  Beautiful & historic building, right in the heart of Sewickley."
test_454,"Said they are open until 3pm, but when we showed up at 2:30 we were turned away. Said she shut the kitchen down already.  Poor business practice. If you want to close at 2:30, post that on your door.  We've been there a few times before, but when you're made to feel like you're not welcome, it doesn't make you want to come back."
test_455,"This is a really friendly neighbourhood yoga studio. I've been coming here for years. There's not much street parking (a few cars will fit in the front where the curb is) but there's usually more than enough room in the garage. There are two studios here, there is the hot studio and the regular non heated studio. The bathroom and change room is extremely clean and that's one aspect I really appreciate about it. A few years back I participated in the energy exchange program here where I volunteered for a few hours in exchange for free classes. The staff are really friendly as well. 

Prices have gone up since they first opened but I think this is common to all studios city wide."
test_456,"Uhmazing house made icecreams! Personal fave is coffee milk tea and cardamom vanilla. Super nice staff, seriously they're really nice. Cute, clean interior with a calm atmosphere. It's on the smaller side, not too much seating.

They only have brewed coffee though if you're looking for a more extensive coffee/espresso menu."
test_457,"Girlfriend brunch to celebrate a few birthdays - have been other times and this was a real disappointment!!!   In one of the entrees the bacon and potatoes were totally burnt, the waiter forgot to put in a friends order so others were eating while she was waiting and it took 10-15 for the burger to arrive, side salads were really salty, had to try a few times to get the attention of the service staff for hot sauce and bloody mary's were overpriced essentially for a tall glass of ice with a small amount of beverage.   If we come back will do it in the fall to enjoy the outside patio, but doubtful."
test_458,"Definitely a place for children. I went as a single adult to kill time and there really wasn't too much for me, but it's also not meant for me. There were so many interactive exhibitions, cool things for kids to do, and interesting shows. I highly recommend it. While I may not have participated in all of them, the kids seemed to have an absolute blast. There's also the option of going and seeing a 3D movie or going to the planetarium shows. I didn't have time for the planetarium, but the 3D movie on the Pacific was wonderful. Colorful, beautiful, and overall just very well done. Be sure to check movie and planetarium times before you go!"
test_459,"My fiance raved about Seno's from back in his high school days. The last several experiences we have gotten have been less than satisfactory. My best friend chose Seno's for her wedding last October. Payment plans were nice. She got her invites free as well. 

The day all the groomsmen and groom are supposed to pick up their tuxedos we come across a ton of issues. Shirts were too short or too long depending on the groomsmen. Some shirts were the wrong size entirely. They messed up my fiance's shoe size twice! We called to make sure they had his size since his is a size 17-18. They assured us they had it but by the time he picked them up (granted he probably should have checked before leaving the shop), went back home to start getting ready since we were now 3 hours away from the ceremony, he realized they were the wrong size again. He called me at my hair appointment and by then I told him there was no way to have them fix it and get to the venue on time. He had to use his own shoe which didn't match.

Despite this issue we tried again when price checking for our own wedding this coming March. They didn't have suits in the colors I needed but they had tuxedos in similar colors, again not exact colors - my bridesmaids all got their dresses from David's Bridal. My fiance's sister is standing with him so her dress is in a light grey color. I of course wanted matching suits or tuxes to she wasn't standing out. We were quoted a price and checked around.

Men's Wearhouse - which is the brother shop to David's Bridal - had the exact colors we needed and in suits which my fiance was very clear he wanted. We got a great deal too. We went back to Seno's to see if they could do better on the tuxes since the color didn't match. They spoke with their general manager and was only able to beat Men's Wearhouse by $5-$10 (prices varied if the groomsmen brought their own shoes or not). They said they couldn't go any further down.

We ultimately went with Men's Wearhouse since they were giving us exactly what we wanted and it was only going to cost us $5-$10 more per suit."
test_460,"Great food, great customer service by  Gina she is amazing, I recommend this place, I'm addicted to it."
test_461,Been hear a few times and was not overly impressed. Finally had time brisket stack and realized what I have been missing. Well done sir
test_462,"One of our favorite places! My husband would eat here weekly if I let him. The staff is wonderful and the hot salsa sure is hot! 
The food is always fast and good! We took my family here for a quick dinner when they came to visit. Everybody loved how good the food was and it's affordable. Love salsa Blanca!"
test_463,"Great company to deal with, Brad gave us a quote to replace our heat pump and air handler and was less than anyone else had quoted.  Jared and crew installed the system in record time and did a wonderful job.   A-Tech has our business from now on and we recommend them to any and all who need air conditioning work done.  They are honest, reliable, answer all questions and stand behind their work."
test_464,"Hilarious, only at Dicks.

5* experience. Good food and drinks. I recommend going at least once. 

Service - EXEMPLARY AND DICKISH. 

Hey, isn't that what you expect at Dicks?"
test_465,Love this place my company comes here for our team builders and they are so great. There food is delicious also. They ya e private rooms to host your parties.
test_466,"Stay away from this place because it's too yummy, you can't handle it. The Philly chee steak sandy made me feel like hurting all the other posers who had been selling me cheese steak lies previously. Plus, the friendly guy behind the register recommended that I add avocado. Who knew?? Flavor shotgun blast to my dome!"
test_467,Service was great. The Santorini salad and fries were awesome! Great neighborhood lunch spot
test_468,Wasn't too impressed with this buffet. We went because we had the 2/1 coupons but even with that it wasn't really worth it.
test_469,"I really like the burgers here!

It's a dimly lit pub-style restaurant inside, and I find the burgers (both regular and turkey) to be reliably tasty. Choose from a list of free toppings (pickles, hot peppers, etc), cheese selections (extra $) and additional toppings for extra $ (avocado, various mayos, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, etc)

I enjoy the fact that they offer onion rings as a burger topping ($1.50 extra) and the fries are great. Don't feel like indulging in fries with your burg? Sub them for the ""greens"" instead...the balsamic dressing it comes with is delicious!!"
test_470,"Bill has been preparing my individual and rental property taxes for years. It is absurd to me that anyone could have anything negative to say about the guy. He thoroughly explains everything to me and answers any questions I have, even throughout the year. It has been a great benefit for me to have him handle my complicated IRA's and rental property taxes including some additional write offs I would have never known about. He is very honest and will call me if anything comes into question so that I always remain in compliance. My parents and brother have trusted his services for years as well. I recommend him to anyone who is serious about a tax and accounting professional."
test_471,"Tortilla soup was super spicy and delicious ! Chrissy at the bar was super attentive, friendly and helpful !! Food and service was amazing"
test_472,"I used to go to Sushi-Q every time I  passed by Square One, but now that it's closed, I found a great alternative to it. Honestly, I look forward to eating at Chipotle more than shopping.  I haven't had too many authentic Mexican meals in my life, but I started loving Mexican food because of Chipotle.  It's definitely a life-changer :p What I would always order is their burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, half and half (chicken and steak), mild sauce, corn (yum), sour cream and cilantro, and sometimes a huge dollop of avocado.  Portion varies from time to time, but taste is always uh-mazing.  My mouth's watering right now just talking about it."
test_473,"We had so much fun when we went last weekend for my friend's birthday! It was so much fun to work with each other and make friends at neighboring tables. It was, however, kind of a bummer that only one person was able to win a prize. We would have appreciated a certificate! The sense of satisfaction solving the mystery was awesome."
test_474,I have used this groomer for my Yorkie a few times... they are so kind to the dogs and do exactly what you ask for.  I have used a few other groomers around town and I have to say I will be sticking here.
test_475,Good vietnamese sub. Spicy without being overwhelming.  Fresh bread lightly toasted.   Beef was juicy and tender. Reasonably priced at under $8
test_476,"Be prepared... The prices here are higher than most strip restaurants, but the service is amazing. The steaks were tender and the salmon had great flavor. If you're looking for service this is the place, but know you're gonna pay for it."
test_477,We just needed a box spring and went to several places looking for one.  The one we needed was not in stock.  Spencer was the only person we talked to that day who actually looked up the product availability and delivery schedule.  Speedy and excellent customer service.
test_478,"So I really tried to give this Starbucks a chance. Every single time I have gone my order is incorrect! I specifically ask for soy milk in all of my coffee drinks, not just for fun! but because I am lactose intolerant. Like if someone asks for soy milk please use it!!!!!!!! 

There have been multiple times when I went through the drive through and pull off to take a sip of my drink and it is not soy milk. Soy milk tastes totally different than regular milk and you know it right when you taste it. Like I look on the cup and it has the order correct on the cup but the contents are never right! It is such an inconvenience to have to drive back or even visit another Starbucks because they messed up my order."
test_479,"I really appreciate them upping their prenatal therapists. It allows me to get in for a massage when I really need it. 

The staff is always polite. They have really stepped up their game and I for one am a returning customer. 

Thank you."
test_480,"What the heck has happened to this place!!??  There obviously has been a conscious decision to just let this place go. The interior is in need of a renovation, the associates rarely say hi or offer help, many not friendly, many homes where product goes is empty, broken displays everywhere, missing price tags, the counters at check out and return look terrible, the place is dirty, foot traffic is way down, many off brand products, flea market toys and junk for sale up front, etc. This used to be my first location location I'd  go for any electronics, now it's the last!!!"
test_481,"Middle Eastern ( Syrian ) sweet treat in Scarborough.
                          best baklava in the city
 Shop is clean, simple and delicacies are displayed openly . You can see and choose what you like. They are fresh and made right there. it is good to eat them with black tea (with  No sugar)."
test_482,Best in the North Valley! Gluten Free offerings too. Go early or pay the price in wait time. The Basic and omelets offer the most bang for buck.
test_483,12 of us went on a Friday night. There was a large variety of food ordered and everyone enjoyed their meals. I would give 5 stars but the server was not very attentive. Wine is included. Overall an awesome value for Vegas!
test_484,"I dine here every couple of months. The quality of the food is unmatched. The wild game meats are always paired with great sides that compliment very well. Great cozy atmosphere,  phenomenal wine list and incredible service round off this farm to table restaurant. I love it, love it, love it. Ask for Amy or Rod. Oh yeah the cocktails are super creative and interesting."
test_485,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake.

Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldn't know yummy if it bit them on the butt!

Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I can't say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
test_486,Delicious. Must do the house smokin sauce. Huge portions and great service. Best lunch in Vegas yet
test_487,"Great restaurant, great staff, great food, great great great!

We made a reservation with Maria, the nicest hostess ever! Then Our waiter, MIchael, was amazing and friendly and super-attentive. Then the manager Jamie was so polite and nice and even stopped by the table to check on us and wish us a happy anniversary!

Also the food was amazing. Get the prime rib!

We had an amazing time overall and will absolutely be back!!!"
test_488,"A fanTAStic convenience store in the far northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, this convenience store has EVERYTHING you'd expect and more! 
Starting with the personnel, clean cut, friendly folks that are eager to please.
Fountain sodas: One of those fancy Coke machines that not only have the different sodas, but can add different flavors to all of them (lemon, cherry, vanilla, and more!) as well as Powerade, Dasani waters, and more! (with FAT straws, too!)
Hot coffee: multiple flavors, brews, and locales, there are flavored creamers and multiple types of sugar to add a little bit of oomph! to your java.
Candy's, chips, Icees, sodas, beer and wine, ice and ice cream, there's even a ""malt"" machine where you mix your own flavors of milkshakes!
Sinclair gasoline, car wash, and someday a restaurant with drive thru, this Desert Pit Stop convenience store is a fantastic welcome addition to the Providence area of Las Vegas.

test_489,"The food is pretty good but what I really loved about this place is the atmosphere and service. Service was very attentive and courteous, and the patio is beautiful and intimate. Perfect place for a date!"
test_490,"We won't be returning here after the poor customer service and soggy, greasy pizza we received on our last visit.  

We ordered a pizza and were told 10-15 minutes and i picked it up like 15 minutes past the quoted pickup time.  When I walked in the pizza was sitting on top of the pizza oven which makes the pizzas soggy, so if you get a pizza and they have it sitting on top of the pizza oven tell them you want a new one or better yet go somewhere else.  

When I got home I realized the pizza was really soggy and greasy.  I thought maybe it was undercooked or something.  I called them to let them know what happened and they blamed me for picking it up past the time they told me, it's not like I was an hour late or something!  Wow, talk about poor customer service.  It's ok we will get pizza from a real pizza place and Greek food from our regular spot, The Great Greek, that has much better Greek food and better customer service. 

We will let our friends in the area know about our experience here."
test_491,"Love the noodles  this is a great place if you are looking for hand pulled noodles in the area. Delicious food, I tried the pork with noodles and beef noodle broth with thin and thick noodles. Both the dishes were delicious. I go back frequently"
test_492,"So yummy, the yakisoba was amazing and the kimchi chicken udon was delicious. Definitely had a kick to it"
test_493,Amaziiingggg piri piri chicken !! Their piri piri sauce is amazing !!! The pasteis de nata are suupperr good. Everything is always fresh. One word: AMAZING
test_494,"Beautiful ambience with outdoor seating and a live jazz band. Excellent hospitality.  We tried the melon sangria which was light and refreshing and something different.  And, loved the food... We ordered the cheese pastry, chicken liver patte and eggplant forna bake.  The food was delish!!!! We were very happy with the whole experience."
test_495,"Everything was amazing.  Started with the brisket biscuit.  It was awesome and the only problem was that it was stuffed with lots of meat so  I couldn't finish all my delicious Fried chicken, waffles and spiced watermelon after wolfing down the biscuits.   Peach cobbler dessert was tasty too.  I don't even like whiskey, but thoroughly enjoyed the white whiskey concoction I had."
test_496,Really great service from our server Damon. He greeted us with a smile and took the time to go over the menu with us. The menu has a good selection of traditional and fusion Korean dishes. I ordered the bulgogi pizza and my husband had the kalbi ribs. Both were very good! The 3 chicken was more than enough for 3 grown men! We will be back!
test_497,"Jakes scores high marks from me because it is a locally owned eating establishment oozing with character.  That alone makes it fairly unique for this area.  I have been for lunch half a dozen times and the food has always been fair to really good.  They do offer daily specials (I had the cheese-steak sandwich recently), however, the lunch menu could use little updating.  The deserts have always been top notch..specifically the banana pudding and the blueberry cake.  I have not been during dinner, so I cannot comment on those items.  Overall, Jakes is a place I look forward to stopping by when I'm in the area and my kids love the place."
test_498,"After a long day of work I come hear to unwind, great service, very nice people and the food is very good."
test_499,"By the name you would think it's a Hawaiian place. It is defiantly not a Hawaiian BBQ place. It has more Korean food than Hawaiian. 

We walked in and the place was busy seemed like the end of lunch rush. The tables are stacked next to each other in the middle like family style or large groups. So you would end up sitting next to strangers. That I didn't like at all. It was bad enough that as soon as we walked in all eyes were on us. I hate that. But we found a table by the wall where we could sit alone. The tables that were empty were dirty. Our server Jody (male) he was nice and cleaned off our table while we sat down. 

Jody was what made me give 4 stars instead of 3. He was so nice and so personable, not to mention very attentive. Good service makes all the difference to me. 

Looking at the menu I was quite overwhelmed. It's huge! Perhaps because it's in both English and Korean. But I didn't know what to order so my friend said she always gets the combo plate. We both ordered the combos. Then some lady comes by puts little kimchi dishes on our table and boiled peanuts. The boiled peanuts are interesting but pretty good. I now know I am not a fan of kimchi. I didn't like it. I tried a few. The bean sprout one and the radish one and some sort of white noodle thing. 

The combo comes with teriyaki BBQ chicken, beef rib tips, some meat egg combination I think it was called Jin, lots of rice, macaroni salad and a dipping sauce. It was good. I'd order it again."
test_500,"Since I found Great Wall (35th and Camelback) and Little Saigon (58th and Glendale) I don't like Panda Express. Plus my favorite SweetFire Chicken Breast is nothing but fried dough and not much chicken in it. If you want to spent $7~9 I'd rather want to eat dim sum at Great Wall or Pho noodle at Little Saigon, it worth to drive there."
test_501,"Jave been to this place several times now. This ice cream shop is in a prime location. They're right in the stone crest plaza by restaurants and the fountain area where the night concerts are held.  So,  it's a convenient stop for a little dessert after dinner or while watching a concert. 

There's plenty of seating outside on tables in the square between the restaurants or eight by the fountains. Parking is pretty hard to find though on primetime nights (Friday/Saturday). 

The line is usually long, but moves quickly.  They have plenty of ice cream options, cone options and topping options. They also serve shakes but I've never tried those. One scoop of ice cream is huge so,  if you like ice cream,  you'll get as much as you need. 

Prices are reasonable and staff is pretty nice."
test_502,Well versed in massage for treating/correcting sport related issues with a variety of treatment styles/methods/techniques.  I am sure she could do a 'spa' massage as well but those are dime a dozen.  Highly recommend.
test_503,"Is it overpriced? Yes.  Is it the best Chinese food I've had? No.  BUT it is the best Chinese food on the strip in Las Vegas and hence the generous 4 stars on Yelp.

Noodle Asia has always hit the spot when I'm in Las Vegas and craving Chinese food.  I only wish they would open a tad bit later to let me wander in drunk fulfilling the craving for a hot bowl of won ton noodle soup.  For those thinking the high review is because of eating under influence that is not true.  I've been here drunk, sober, and hung over and all three circumstances Asia Noodle has always been good to me.  I even try to stay inside the Venetian or Palazzo just so I don't have to go outside and face the elements to get to my beloved Asia Noodle.

Won Ton Noodle Soup (with and without BBQ pork), Night Market Fried Rice, Hot and Sour Soup, and the BBQ Combination Plate are my standard fare here.

On a side note, Asia Noodle recently got a facelift and looks a lot fancier than it did before.  For you sports fan nuts out there, they even have bar seating that faces the Cantor's sports book so you don't have to unglue your eyes from the game while eating."
test_504,Just wanted to say thanks to all the staff at Emser tile for always providing us with great service. This review is probably long overdue but better late than never. Great selection of tile and very reasonably priced. Thanks again to Dave and the gang.
test_505,"At first i thought I would like this place because of its convenient location near my office but after spending about 60$ on a pedicure and having the nail polish come off after 2 days, Spa Diva has greatly disappointed me, I called and left a message with the receptionist who told me that a manager would call me back - which never happened. I never had this issue with any other spa before so I won't be going back to Spa Diva."
test_506,"Dawn and the staff at Stanford Capital are awesome!  They were very helpful and knowledgeable.  they make things very clear about what they need from you and if you don't have it they go out of their way to help you get it.  I misplaced my Note - I'm sure it's somewhere in my paperwork but wow they went out of their way to help me obtain it so I didn't have to tear the house apart and hold up my refinancing - it could have taken me weeks to find it or I may not have ever found it but they knew how and got it in just a couple days.  They saved me so much time and I appreciate that!  I know the mortgage business can be a busy one and I myself have a hard time trusting people.  Well I guarantee that if you utilize Stanford Capital you will NOT be disappointed.  Just know you the consumer has to help get things done you have to participate as they will require items, signatures, etc.  The staff can only do so much and if you don't return their call or participate in your refinance you will find it difficult only because y ou make it difficult!

So TRUST  the Staff and Dawn will make a difficult transaction as easy as possible - just participate and it will be done in no time.

Dawn, Tyler, Adriana - Thank you for all your hard work.  You made my refinance a BREEZE  and you helped me save a lot of money.  You Guys ROCK!"
test_507,"I love Encanto Park. I initially came here because I live so close, but there are a bunch of reasons why I come back. First of all, it's beautiful. There's a little lake and water system that runs through the park with a few walking bridges that add a nice touch. There are tons of walking trails and ducks/birds/swans/turtles to look at. My boyfriend has hit golf balls there a few times and really enjoys the facility. There may be a hobo lurking here and there, but that's what you get almost anywhere in downtown Phoenix. There's a children's amusement park that I have yet to go to, but I'll amend my post once I've gone.

Overall, this park is perfect for an afternoon stroll, a book in the shade, or place to hit a few balls."
test_508,"One of the best places for affordable and good quality furniture - Always liked the unique Swedish designs!

The food selection in the dining area is good. There are days when they take off the dining cost from your total bill, which is really good!"
test_509,"Great nail salon, brand new, super nice staff and decent prices services. I got a #2 pedicure which was so relaxing and my toes are perfect! I also got a full set and the tech took her time (Kelly I think was her name). The entire experience was great and I have found my new nail salon."
test_510,Not too helpful. Wouldn't give me a total price. They should figure out what the total is with all taxes and fees so they can give me their best offer before they expect someone to commit use them for business. Wouldn't help me find a coupon off the ap that the previous jiffy lube said I could get if I downloaded the ap. Just didn't seem to care about it at all.
test_511,Unbelievable incompetence!  My wife and I came here for an ID card.  They could not write down the correct address from what the system showed them to the envelope as her ID card was sent to the wrong apartment.  6 weeks later and numerous calls still no ID card.
test_512,"Passed by this restaurant several times. Wife researched online, looked good decided to stop. Great experience. Staff was ultra-friendly and considerate. Told them we were first-timers and they did the rest. 
Wife and I had chicken sandwiches - they were great. Kids had tenders - they loved them. Great variety of sauces, sides and drinks. 
Will definitely return."
test_513,The pizza is great (much improved from when they opened) and they use great ingredients. Give Pizza Antica a try. It is worth it. Informal and warm environment. Great if you have kids!
test_514,"We're going to keep this simple......OK? 

Do you love Mexican Food? Do you like a small family feel when you go eat? 
Go to this place! Everything is made with love! I walked in, and the owner was there and made my food to order. Had a nice talk with him about Phoenix in general as he basically said he opened his restaurant because Quality Mexican Food can be tough to find in the area.(Most great Mexican places are on the West Side) 
Its about a mile away from my house, and I will be back for sure! 
Fantastic Pastor, great Cabeza, and carne asada made like a backyard cookout! 


***NO FIREARMS ALLOWED***"
test_515,"Doing the mussels again, and the skirt steak,and the wings... I can't come here and not be a pig. Busy night and everything is perfect
...."
test_516,"What a treasure! Everything is gluten-free (and absolutely delicious), the atmosphere is relaxed, friendly, and charming, and the staff were so accommodating and patient with us as we took our sweet time ordering from the lengthy menu. This place is a MUST try whether or not you're gluten-free."
test_517,"Its good enough for me for last minute nibble. Many tables, smile service. Many choices. Fast."
test_518,"Aaliyah at the restaurant was super rude . Maybe bc it was myself and my sister - two girls - but she was short , rude, did not smile a bit . We were asking questions about the drinks and menu, and she blank stared us and didn't offer and information. We ordered drinks and water with our food . She never came back . We asked another waitress after 20 minutes . We finally got water and then our drinks . The food was ok- but the service by far made it to where I won't go back"
test_519,The garlic knots are the best. My family and I love them. The pizza is really good. It's ultra thin. Get the garlic knots!!!!!
test_520,"We all know how hard it is to find a reliable, TRUSTWORTHY auto mechanic, and this place is the absolute best. We have been coming here since we moved to Gilbert almost 3 years ago and have had all of our oil changes and some minor car repairs due to standard wear and tear done here & we always feel comfortable & are very satisfied with the prices and the work they do. If we ever moved away from Gilbert for any reason, I would go out of my way to keep taking my car here for regular maintenance and repairs."
test_521,"I went to the Henderson location and there Vanessa Mullenix was really helpful, she explained everything more than clear, and the girl on the front (unfortunately I forget her name) was so sweet and professional. The services repair supouse to took 15 days, but they gave me my car in one week , more than happy for that. The service quality excellent, my car looks than before."
test_522,"I love poke and Cali Love does a great job. I had the Hopeful bowl, black rice, salmon poke, avocado, ginger and more. Delicious! Large bowl? Better be hungry since the black rice is filling. 
Challenge can be the line up and who's in front of you since there's so much on the menu to review. They almost need a reading line up and someone dedicated to pointing you in the right direction of choice. 
Love what they do and I'll be back."
test_523,"Any time I need electric work done, I call Waz at Electric Matter. He was recommended to me when I purchased quite a number of lights for my new apartment, and I've never been happier with his quality of work. He's incredibly personable and respectful, offers fair pricing, gets the job done right and on schedule. 

Thanks again!"
test_524,"Recently we called Titan to look at an area that was leaking on a curved tile roof. They identified the problem and gave us a couple of options for repair. They came when they said they would and did the job, leaving everything clean and tidy afterwards."
test_525,"My fellow yelpers didn't let me down with this recommendation.

I have'nt had pho for a while. This place is in Chinatown and the small parking lot is always packed on the weekends, but I swooped by pretty early today and found a spot.  

Everything looked great on the menu and the noodle dishes also comes in ""XL size.""

For takeout, I ordered-
P11: Tai Gan - rare steak, tendon, and rice noodle. 

B4: Bbq Pork with Vermicelli and

Golden Egg rolls which was delightfully crispy.

Broth is tasty and just the perfect amount of star anise and seasoning , with generous chunks of bbq pork, tendons, and sides.  The rare slices of beef flank were packed separately on the side.  I like to throw those in the broth once it comes out but luckily they weren't well done. The Bbq pork was well seasoned.

Quality and quantity.  Best of both worlds.  Overall a statisfying bowl of pho.  Next time it will be Banh Mi sandwiches and Smoothies."
test_526,We had a party of six for breakfast.  We were promptly met by our server Felicia.  She took all the orders and read each one back to make sure everything was correct.  Felicia explained the difference between bagel and bialy to us and gave us a sample of a bialy....very good!  Will come back for sure!
test_527,"""awful new menu"" 

The food at rum fish used to be reasonably good. The atmosphere is amazing. However they changed the menu recently it's probably the worst food I've ever had. I've tried it three times since the new menu and every time has been extremely disappointing. They need to do something in a hurry or they're going to go out of business."
test_528,"Tiffany's is the best. We get every birthday and holiday cake from their bakery. Delicious every time. 

Have special ordered cut out cookies at Christmas and they are beautiful and taste awesome!

Staff always helpful and owners nice and friendly too. 

Ice cream in summer time is always a treat. 

Highly recommend this bakery!"
test_529,"Yaaaas! I love getting lunch here. They have both grilled and fried chicken. Both are so good but I get the grilled...just to be more healthy. 

They also have a variety of sides such as yuca fries,black beans, and plantains. I also see they have empanadas, but I haven't tried those yet. 

The place is usually clean and when ordering in, staff brings you your meal. 

See you there!"
test_530,"This joke of an establishment has taken $230 off my credit card for oxygeneo facials I have pre paid for in the summer.... When I went In to redeem one, the machine wasn't working. I was told my generic facial I received (which was atrocious), would be complimentary and the owner would call me regarding the situation... I never received a call. Fast forward to a few months later, I called to book a new appointment OR receive a refund. It has since been countless calls, 2 messages and 2 emails. All I am wanting to do is book an appointment that has been paid for!!! This ""spa"" is a scam. The least the receptionist could do is call back and say she doesn't have the authority to help me but will look into the issue.... That is customer service 101. I am waiting a few more days to see if these crooks ever get back to me. I would threaten to report them to the Better Business Bureau... But they probably haven't even heard of the BBB."
test_531,"I had a very positive experience with BMW of Las Vegas in the course of purchasing a 2018 BMW 540i X-Drive.  My sales person, Paul Reed, and the inventory manager, Cliff Cho, were extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating throughout the process.  And, absolutely no high pressure pitches from either of them.  They have actually stayed in touch after the purchase.  The ""BMW Genius"" who provided my initial training and answers to myriad questions on the new vehicle was Krystel Bockholt, and working with her has been an absolute joy.  There was an issue with my order that caused a delay in receiving my car, but the General Manager, Eric Ziegenbein, intervened on my behalf, and I got a 2018 vehicle for the same price as I had been quoted for the 2017 model.  I would highly recommend BMW of Las Vegas for anyone considering the purchase of a new BMW.  If you have the opportunity to work with Paul, Cliff, and/or Krystel in the process, you will also have a great time and a lot of fun."
test_532,"98 minutes after i called, and finished eating something else - figuring, my food is not coming, my soggy Rosati's pizza arrives. 
Extremely sub-par. Always has been.
Doesn't help that 2 years ago i swore i would never go back after i had a valid coupon and they just decided that day, ehhh were not honoring that.
Also came in for a slice and a soda at 1:14 pm once and noone was around. After i said hello? Someone in the back shouted! YYEeSSss???? 
Then proceeded to say
Sternly ""no slices now"" while drying his hands over a pizza he just removed from the oven.
I actually saw an instagram picture from someone who stayed at the four seasons of a cockroach in there bar area. Thats just crazy. You own a restaurant in troon north. Get your sh** together."
test_533,The best sweet bao I've had. The sweet potato and the taro fillings were both great. And they're cute. That always helps.
test_534,"Randy (Sales Rep) was very knowledgeable and helpful through out the process. He assisted with any questions I had throughout the process and made sure that the move fit into my budget. Aurea (Coordinator) was very professional and ""on point"" with the scheduling of my move and quickly assisted me with my claim for my couch when it was delivered with a cracked support. Kevin (Driver) was very helpful with staying in contact with me during the transport. He even arrived a few days ahead of schedule and arrived at the time he said.. The overall professionalism and commitment to the customer exceeded my expectations which made this an easier process to coordinate my move. The only reason I'm not giving 5-stars is because my couch was broke sometime during the transit and I'm still waiting on Allied to call me back about it."
test_535,"Finally found a great Vietnamese restaurant.  Drove by quite a few times and never stopped because it is on the small side.  Also, since relocating to the area in March, I have been disappointed with almost every food establishment I have visited.  This place is awesome.   I had the filet Pho and my wife had the lemongrass chicken banh mi.   The Pho was fantastic with plenty of meat slices.  The banh mi was very good with a great flavor.   We also ordered spring rolls.  They looked like they were over cooked but they tasted great. I am a hobby chef and friends with properly trained chefs.  I am very picky and difficult to satisfy but this place beat my expectations"
test_536,If I could choose not to star this company I would but they have horrible cancellation policy. Basically if I don't make my flight I will not get my money nor have a credit towards another flight at a later date. Then speaking with the representative she hung the phone in my face when I requested to speak with a manager. Upset at how horrible I was treated by this company will never considered flying this air line again
test_537,"while traipsing through the wynn, we decided to stop in sugar & ice for a little after lunch/before dinner snack. the gorgeous window cake displays caught our eye instantly as we entered. we ordered a slice of their hamburger pizza + extra toppings and the meatball sliders, plus a sangria. the service was quick, though the only friend staff member seemed to be the guy who mixed our drinks. the price was decent and the food was pretty good. the best part was the sangria, which wasn't weak at all for a fruity little cocktail. next time we'll definitely try some of sweets!

something rather amusing, the whole pizzas are huge! they even come in a gigantic square pizza take out box that anyone standing at a mere 5'2 like myself or smaller probably would not be able to carry without some assistance. i noticed the couple that was seated across from us requested their pizza be individually wrapped by slice so they could take the whole pizza back to their room. this definitely went with their whimsical appeal though."
test_538,Great spot to get a haircut.  All the ladies here are great and cut hair well. This the only chain hair cutting spot I will go to in northwest LV.
test_539,"Pixy Cakes was a preferred vendor for our wedding venue. At first I was going to go with a bakery I love in the Phoenix area, but once I tried Pixy Cakes at an open house I was sold. They have so many flavors and combinations available, all are delicious! Once we picked our flavors it came down to the design. I knew I wanted cupcakes and a single tier for us to cut. Once I explained the colors and vision of the wedding the staff was able to design exactly what I wanted. I am a more simple, classic bride, but they are able to do the most intricate designs you can imagine. Last minute I wanted to add a tier to the cake and they were able to accommodate this with very little notice. Everyone at our wedding raved about the cupcakes. I brought a few leftovers to my work and had several people ask what bakery we used. We saved our top tier for our first wedding anniversary and I can't wait to get another taste!"
test_540,"Super cute soda shop ! 
Inexpensive and absolutely delicious 
I'm not big on soda but this is more then just soda and it's honestly so good. Cute date idea !"
test_541,"If I could give a negative 4 star review, I would. Customer service DOES NOT EXIST, and I'm beginning to think that my car no longer exists either. 

Seriously, haven't seen my car since 12.20.2015. NO CLUE where its at. 

Horrible business. I don't understand how this company is allowed to operate. I am so stressed out and considering filing a claim."
test_542,"This place is my favorite donut place. The donuts alone are enough to get you hooked. The prices are awesome too. The variety is extensive and always impressive.......but best of all is the donut milkshake. Do yourself a favor and get like a dozen different donuts from this place........find your favorite......and then when you go back the next time make your favorite a milkshake. You will not be sorry. Also, you have some of the coolest, and most helpful employees. Oh oh oh and there are always good jams and plenty of seats. Plus if it's far away from you no worries. It's right next to the freeway!"
test_543,The pupusa flavor in this restaurant was okay. I ordered the pl√°tanos maduro with beans and sour cream. The beans were watery which I didn't enjoy. I did get a discount on the pupusas when I ordered a dozen. I did have to ask if they had any deals though.
test_544,"Rick Bayless has nothing to fear from these wannabes.  Sure the ignorant masses will lap up this Disneyland Mexican, but it is badly over-priced and the pop art bunker of a restaurant without a bathroom blows.  The food is good, but I will take a taco truck over this joint any day."
test_545,"Tried this place due to the reviews. However, was is great not really, but it wasn't bad. Yes, it is different and everyone speaks English. Not as thorough as other places, and the massage was not long as others had mentioned. It was dead when I went in. Besides the other woman that was working on my pedicure there was one more just going through the scheduling. She was an average sized Hispanic woman and wasn't friendly, never smiled, nor even made eye contact. Just because I am not someone's client does not mean all around courtesy and friendliness should not exist. My toenails were not cleaned underneath nor filed evenly either. I felt the price and lack of attentiveness did not go hand in hand.
I luckily did not have the unfortunate event of not getting through the phone lines like others mentioned. Lastly, reading some of the responses from the owner Diana with excuses rather than a simple apology or directly messaging non-satisfied customers/potential ones puts me off. 
If you want to try something new than I would recommend it, but no the massages are not long, they don't massage your ankles nor roll them like most places do, they also aren't as attentive nor do proper cuticle, nail cleaning."
test_546,"When I planned out my Toronto trip, I had all my meals scheduled, and this bakery wasn't on the agenda. But because I got distracted while jamming on the ukulele (which is a whole other story), the people who I was supposed to head off to Barque with took off without me. So there I was in Richmond Hill last Friday, not sure what to do about dinner, when someone mentioned that there was a French pastry shop within walking distance that was supposed to be excellent. And after checking out the Yelp reviews, I thought ... Why not?

So a few of us wandered over to Times Square, and instead of BBQ, I had a pastry and three macaroons for dinner. While I enjoyed what was there, I was somewhat surprised by the limited selection. Perhaps it's just that by 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, a bakery is picked clean ... but there weren't so many empty shelves to give the impression that they were once overflowing with a huge array of additional baked goods. 

I was impressed by the huge selection of teas, however. There were at least three dozen quality choices, far more than I usually encounter, so that part of my visit was superior.

I'm rating this a 3-star rather than a 4-star experience entirely due to the limited selection, which I found disappointing. But if you're basically looking for macaroons, and it's not too far out of your way, it's worth a visit."
test_547,"Know before you go.  Luna's is for you if you value the confluence of nutrition,  sensory appeal, and food-safety.  You will not find traditional comfort food here, and don't come with ideas of scoring a bargain.  It is not budget conscious,  but there is definitely value for the money spent.  Think twice...this is a VEGAN establishment. ..... no fish, chicken, pork, or beef.  
I am a frequent habitue at Luna's because there are so few other restaurants that meet my criteria for a meal.  I am not vegan, because I eat fish, but otherwise I am.  I don't want heavily salted food, any  simple carbohydrates/sugars, nor any processed foods.  Luna's dots every i, crosses every t.  I can order anything on the menu without worry.  Exception :  I don't drink adult beverages, and they sell wine and beer.  Have not ever been disappointed with an eat-in or take out meal here.  Frequently I will order a take out meal for dinner when I dine in for lunch.....and I love how I can look forward to dinner with this plan.  I also value the fact that they are environmentally conscious viz. carry-out containers."
test_548,This dive shop is awesome! Helpful and knowledgeable people. They have a great facilities including a pool on site. They helped me figure out my new dive computer free of charge! If you're a diver... ya gotta check this place out!
test_549,"Great pork belly, fantastic miso.  If you like spicy get the Ono sauce.  Japanese-southern fusion, delicious.  Appetizers are fantastic, favorite is the Brussels sprouts."
test_550,"I've historically been a fan of DWR, but after a recent purchase through this location I do not plan to patronize them again. I ordered some items during the Knoll sale, and what began as a pleasant experience turned sour.

Issues pertaining to shipping and communication: the account executive I worked with did not properly update my home address in the system after I had corrected it with her (I had to correct it with freight), I received a heads-up from DWR that white glove shipment would be scheduled AFTER the item already arrived (the freight company called the day before and I was luckily available at home during the delivery window with 24-hour notice), and I never received notice or tracking info of items that came through the mail.

The worst part: I was overcharged over $800, and had to reach out to them about it. The account executive didn't even care to update me on the status of the refund until I reached out to her--again.

I wrote to corporate about the matter two weeks ago, and still no reply. This is a testament to how much they care about their customers.

Remember: the DWR studios are simply showrooms. They do not stock items, and customers still have to go through an ordering process. Knoll, Herman Miller, Vitra, and other fine manufacturers are available through many online retailers like Lumens and Yliving with free shipping, no tax, and world's better customer service. I've had seamless experiences with them, and would recommend going that route over ordering through the DWR studio any day."
test_551,"I was taken here while visiting from Chicago and had one of the best margaritas of my life.  I tried the house (on ice with salt) and it was fantastic, but what I couldn't get enough of was the strawberry-lime one.  I couldn't taste a drop of alcohol...and that's when you know you have a good mixed drink on your hands. I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.  

The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.  Supposedly the tacos are top-notch, I will have to give them a whirl next time I'm in town.  

I highly suggest going here for a happy hour or dinner."
test_552,"After a miserable experience with Yes A.C a  few years ago I was pleasantly surprised by the professional, and rapid service performed by Dr. Cool without any upselling attempts.
Our ac went out and I expected the worse. I filed a claim with AHS and immediately was referred to Dr. Cool. I called and Bruno arrived with 40 minutes. He expertly diagnosed the problem [ a bad condenser fan], replaced it, checked the system and was done in around one hour. 
I will use these guys from now on for all maintenance and service work on our Ac and furnace. I trust these folks and recommend them."
test_553,"Lived here 2 1/2 years. Excellent management along with fast and thorough maintenance made this a super easy place to live. Safe area and gated too. Some stuff is walking distance, and Chandler Fashion Center (restaurants, movies, shops) is a very short drive. Highly recommended and a good value."
test_554,"We got the Healthy Pizza with whole grain crust and the buffalo chicken wings. Everything was delicious!! Great ""healthy"" option for take-out, which we've been looking for for a long time. My only complaint is that we ordered boneless wings but they still sent bone-in, no big deal though."
test_555,This is the closest wine bar to my house (33 miles but worth the drive) and is a great place to have a glass (or bottle) with friends and family. Grab a couch indoors or one of the alcoves on the patio and settle in for some wine and food. The wine list could be expanded to include some local Arizona wines but the list is affordable and a nice selection of wine grapes and styles. The flat breads are a good choice for sharing as is the Greek bruschetta and the meat and cheese board. My go to dinner choice is always the French Dip sandwich.
test_556,"I would give this place 0 stars if possible. The owner, Margarita could not have conducted herself in a worse way. My girlfriend went in to get her hair cut shorter, and Margarita acted like it was the worst thing she has ever had do. 

After it was all said and done, the haircut wasn't right and Margarita didn't even say goodbye. Then when we asked for someone to fix the haircut because it was wrong, Margarita said that my girlfriend isn't welcomed back again. 

PLEASE NEVER GO SUPPORT SOMEONE LIKE THIS!!!"
test_557,"Well, it's more than a month since I had the tiny beet salad at Tarbells.  In addition to posting it on Yelp, I also put a note on the Tarbell site about my experience.  No response at all from them.  I certainly wasn't expecting a free meal, but it would have been nice if they acknowledged my comment.  Won't ever be going there again."
test_558,"So I'm from New Jersey and I've never heard of this place before. My three brothers and I were on a road trip returning from a trip to Cedar Point for my brother's bachelor party. My oldest brother had friends in the area that raved about this place, so he convinced us to go and meet up with his friend for lunch. Boy am I glad he did!

I'm a vegetarian and a road trip with fast food constantly left me with not a lot of options. I am however very happy to say this place offers the largest variety of vegetarian and vegan options available I've seen in a long time. Being a grilled cheese place that may have been a given, but they go out of their way to be accommodating and mention on the menu they'll try their best to make you happy

They have a handy legend on their menu, 'Vegetarian', 'Vegetarian Option Available' and 'Vegan Option Available'. So the majority of their sandwiches and be made specially to order to accommodate your needs.

I ordered the Parma, Italy sandwich with breaded tofu (instead of chicken) and it was... phenomenal! Even I was surprised, the tofu was delicious, the toppings were great, the bread was awesome and the fries and slaw were good! (even though I mostly stuck to the fries). I was so satisfied.

Being a long way from home I knew I wouldn't be able to have something this good for a long time. I took my time and saved half of my sandwich for later. I gave my girlfriend in NJ a call and asked if she wanted anything. She got the vegan version of my sandwich (with vegan cheese). The waitress, who was vegan, noted the tofu may have butter or eggs in the breading (she was unsure) and the bread was not vegan (due to the butter I think). So that's good to note. I'm not sure if they may be able to have non-breaded tofu or even have the bread without the butter, the thought escaped me. I was too busy enjoying my sandwich. But it wouldn't hurt to ask, and I don't see why not.

My three brothers and my brother's friend all enjoyed their meals (with some take-out bags filled with precious leftovers). They also have a fun little gift shop by the register with t-shirts, posters, pins and more.

I wish this place existed closer to me... but maybe it's best it does not (health-wise). However if I am ever in Ohio again, I'll be sure to come back to the Melt.

If you have the chance to give this place a try do your self a favor and DO IT! You'll be very glad you did."
test_559,"Fast service on the night I went, part of 4. horrible food - deep fried calamari was so dipped in so much batter it was rock hard; tom yum soup was way too sweet instead of sour and spice; stir-fry was oily. Save you $ and time, go elsewhere."
test_560,My first time flying with Alaska Air... I was really surprised by the awesome customer service. I have flown with other airlines before and have always waited at least 45 minutes to an hour before being able to speak to a customer service representative. I had to revise my itinerary this past weekend (Seattle to Phoenix) and had to call in 4 times. Not once did I wait more than 2 minutes to speak to a real life representative. The reps were also very polite and funny! Go Alaska Air!
test_561,"I had a small pepperoni pizza. I wasn't feeling the crust at all, it reminded me of store bought pizzas. My pepperoni had curled up into small bowls that were filled with grease;not appetizing. I've had worse pizza but I've definitely had better."
test_562,"Love her, and the staff. Super nice, and very educational. Although I live here in Sedona, I would drive all the way to Tempe to have her fix me :)"
test_563,Excellent beer selection and decent food- definitely worth a try if you enjoy your beers
test_564,"This is my favorite yoga studio in Arizona. 
The principals of Yoga are expressed here. Taught here. 
The heated classes are very consistent and inviting for all levels. 
Great place for beginners to start a practice that will change your life for the better if you give it the time. 
Thank you Biltmore studio for bringing real community Yoga to Scottsdale"
test_565,I've been coming here since Hannah and her husband bought the old salon and just can't go anywhere else. All the technicians do a great job and are very friendly. The salon is always clean and I'm always greeted by name and offered a beverage when I arrive.
test_566,This place has great happy hour specials--the entire menu is half off--on Fridays and Saturdays from 5 pm to 1 am.  The menu is extensive and the food tastes great.  Their desserts are large and inexpensive.  The service is pretty good and relatively fast.  This is pretty much the only place I go for sushi now.
test_567,We tried this restaurant because they have a $26 deal that includes appetizer and entree. We had clam chowder as the appetizer which was creamy and good. Then for the entree we had the garlic chicken. The sauce and veggies they added to it was good but the chicken was overcooked making it dry. The burger we had was big but it was subpar. The ambiance of the place is good and they have TV inside but with the high price but subpar quality of food we got  I don't think we will consider going back.
test_568,"Stopped here for an early dinner.  Service wasn't the best but wasn't the worst either.  It wasn't busy, it was a Monday early evening so no real rush.  We ordered the surf and turf, a cheese burger and their signature shakes.  $16 for this concoction.  Was it worth it?  Not really but what the heck it's a novelty so it's a one time try.  It's odd because as you drink the shake you realize they don't serve it with a spoon or at least we asked for spoons and never got them and the straw is at least an inch short.  So you can't really finish the whole shake without picking up the glass and getting your face into the glass.  Not worth the effort but dang it was $16 half drank shake."
test_569,"I heard they had a great weekend brunch and they do. We couldn't have been happier with the selection, the food, the coffee or the service."
test_570,"This right here is some goooooood tex-mex food. Probably my favorite in Charlotte. Who am I kidding, definitely my favorite in Charlotte. They have a very small outdoor patio (3 or 4 tables). There is literally always a wait here so come early or plan ahead with a reservation. Food has tons of flavor and is prepared perfectly."
test_571,"I was very impressed with Green.  I only came here because the people I worked with on a recent program had ridiculous food restrictions of the vegan variety.  I try to just cover my ears and not listen to them when they talk, because it's like listening to bubble boy.  Have we rebelled against our very nature?

Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The ""mock"" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.  

They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.  

I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.  That's saying a lot.

5 Stars"
test_572,"This was the first buffet I've ever been to (not including cheap places at home like the China Buffet), so I don't have much to compare it to... but WOW. I seriously loved everything on my plate, which included:

--lamb
--lobster ravioli
--california rolls
--mashed potatoes w/ deliciousness in them
--veal
--crab legs
--shrimp

Aaaaand, my mouth just filled with saliva."
test_573,"Always wanted to try this place...now that I have I'm good, no special reason to come back.  I had a Waffel and to be honest it tasted like a pancake.  My wife had a BLT and I guess that was good.  Overall experience doesn't warrant a return visit...sorry black bear."
test_574,I bought some of my wedding stuff here! Really cute shop and the owner is extremely friendly! She tried to give me ideas and was very helpful!
test_575,"we had a craving for pizza And drove to Casanova Brothers from Apache Junction because of the great reviews.  The man behind the counter greeted us immediately and introduced himself as Tony (an owner) and asked our names.  He then asked if we were first time visitors.   Incredibly friendly. 

My wife got the white pizza and I got the meat calzone.  We also ordered garlic knots.   

He brought the pizza and calzone and put it down saying our names as he did. Great memory.  The calzone was huge and it was only the standard size one, not the large.  Its enough for two normal eaters.  Both items were awesome.  the red sauce is great,  the flavor of the meat calzone is super delicious, any one item was worth the trip by itself. 

I wish it weren't such a long drive because this is a definite return.   AWESOME!!"
test_576,"Loved this home owned Italian place. Chef Rudy came out to make sure I was happy with my food! I had caesar salad, seafood pasta & homemade lemoncello gelato.  I loved the ambiance & quality of food!"
test_577,"Went to Border Grill in the Madalay Bay Hotel. We had the lunch salad special-WOW. It was served with chicken, but I asked for Talapia instead and Tom had the chicken. The salad was an amazing blend of hot, sweet, and tart. The salad had slices of nectarines, peaches, grapes and spiced candied walnuts. The service was outstanding and Tom Davis was our waiter. The guacamole is the best and the sparkling peach lemonade was outstanding. We had half a piece of the chocolate pie that had the perfect amount of cinnamon. It would be a place to go again and again. Outstanding."
test_578,Even the simplest arrangements are designed beautifully. Their designs and service are absolutely top-notch!
test_579,"OMG a pizza I looked for all my life...as perfect as you can find.  Chewy thin slightly chard crust that is sturdy enough to hold the toppings, tomato sauce that tasted homemade and delicious, just enough cheese to satisfy ( not a chewy cheese like bubble gum pulling to the ceiling) and finally a pinch or two of fresh cut basil. I added pepperoni to the second Margherita pizza and was in heaven. You gotta go  find this truck.  No kidding..I am HOOKED."
test_580,"I'm going to rate this place like a Hot Dog restaurant.

If I rated it like a real restaurant, it'd get two stars.

But hey.  If you really want a hot dog...."
test_581,"Love, love, love this place. A must visit. Every time I am in Montreal I go there. I always end up buying something. 7 years ago I got a beautiful traveling leather bag that is light and comfortable and still in a perfect shape. Last few visits I bought hamssa pendants and in the most recent one (last week) I just couldn't resist and bought a tea set - beautiful glasses in different colours, a silver coloured tea pot and a tray. Breathtakingly beautiful and practical at the same time. The owner is a lovely young man who is happy to explain about the different quality, origin of and the use of his merchandise. Two months ago they opened Medina Palace, much bigger store a few shops south to the original one (and now they operate both). It doesn't have the same ""sook"" (middle eastern market) feelings but it allows great display of all the beautiful things they sell. Go there, it's a treat for the eyes and the heart."
test_582,"I went to Physicians Physical Therapy (Avondale) for my tennis elbow I have had for months, I also had pain coming from my neck which caused me horrible headaches, most likely from a pinched nerve.  Before I started PT, I couldn't do simple things, like putting something in the microwave, take out the trash, brush my hair or vacuum.  These guys are so wonderful at what they do and really do care, not to mention make you feel like family.  I feel great and am able to resume my normal activities without any issues.  Thank you guys.  Your the best!!!

test_583,"I would love to give this place more stars, but a couple of things prevent me from doing that.  I do love the fact that they give you boiled peanuts.  I haven't had those since ""small keed time"" in Hawaii.  Very nostalgic.  The service is fair, the waiter speaking pidgin.  The food is pretty good. We had the homemade mandoo because we saw the lady making them last time.  The meat jun was on the tough side.  I think the beef needs to be sliced thinner for that.  

My main complaint is with the kim chee.  It was slimy and not very hot or flavorful.  I didn't even touch it after the first bite, and I am usually the one to polish the thing off.  Maybe I just got a bad batch, but in my opinion, having good kim chee is essential for a Korean restaurant.  My second complaint, no restroom!  What restaurant in this day and age does not have a public restroom?  I guess the three star or less kind."
test_584,First time here and the evening service is annoying - slow. I love how this location has a big patio area and the parking is spacious.
test_585,"Normally I enjoy Red Robin...for what it is; a chain burger place that gives you that ""flare"" vibe Office Space so beautifully made apparent. But unfortunately this particular location sooks. Service is sub-par and the food both times we came by was either delivered super late or burnt :/. I don't think we will return since we did give it two shots. I do get that they are the only one nearby but no excuses in my opinion. Not good. Sorry kind staff at RR."
test_586,"Jeff, Vinny and DJ you guys rock! No pressure, fair price, great service and a Beautiful car! What more can I say? I'm definitely a repeat customer!"
test_587,"Pro - The cutest waxing studio in Calgs. They do what they do and they are good at it. Rea is amazing.

Cons - It books up fast so make your appointment early. Last minute appointments are hard to come by. It's pricey but you get what you pay for."
test_588,"The service by store manager was very rude. I wanted to buy something from their store that was on display and wanted to know why we could not buy the item. She was extremely defensive and I wanted to give her feedback that it made no sense not to sell something that was on display. She was very un appreciative she even said that she has so much experience as a store manager that she knew better and client feedback was unimportant.For companies who do not learn and take feedback from clients is a company that will fail. I was very discouraged from the experience.Clients who care enough to tell you are trying to make you improve. There are many stores to shop at and Muji does not have an edge I'll rather spend my money elsewhere. The store manager should have better customer service and a simple "" let me take your number so we can call you when the product is in store"" is simple 101 customer service"
test_589,"THE place to be on Badger game day in Madison!  The campus sports bar has the usual beers and hoardes of drunken fans.  Always a good time....except the time that guy started randomly video-taping me and my girlfriends....yeah, that was weird....but still, a definite staple in any college student's bar scene. 4 stars."
test_590,"Love this place, its one of my fave places to eat at in Vegas! I always get the Ramen bowl; can't go wrong with it. This restaurant is for people with an acquired taste in food, so it's not for everyone - just to give you a heads up; but so far so good in my book. :)"
test_591,"We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.  

All in all, a really nice meal!"
test_592,"In my mission to sample every fast-ish food joint on the whole of College Street we ended up here on a balmy Thursday night in November.

As is usually the case, the first thing that has pulled pork in it I tend to try and here was no exception with the SOUTHERN FANCY 100 per cent beef hot dog featuring BBQ Pulled Pork as well as cabbage slaw.

They give you the option to have the bun either toasted or steamed and when it comes to you is presented in a basket.

The hot dog itself was very good but for the $8 price it simply wasn't large enough, you'd have to buy fries or a poutine and it would end up pushing the price well over $10. (this likely explains why it's usually empty every time I walk past).

Verdict: Tasty but too pricey - go to The Little Dog further down College!"
test_593,"This place should be avoided at all costs.

Luckily, I was not subjected to the food, but I came here for lunch whilst my two co-workers wanted to try a sandwich.

The owner/manager was making sandwiches with one rubber gloved hand and the other hand (not gloved) holding his cell phone while he spoke in Italian for the entire 20 minutes we were waiting. He took orders in between chatting on the phone and never once put it down.

One co-worker was given her sandwich immediately and we waited patiently for the second. Waiting...waiting...more waiting. After 10 minutes we enquired about the second sandwich. Oops. He forgot about it.

To top off the experience, both claim the sandwiches were fairly horrible. Roast beef consisted of: HUGE bun, not enough roast beef and way too much mustard.

Good thing I didn't eat here."
test_594,"How could a resort go so bad so fast. Soiled linen and poor maid service would normally turn me off. However from August 28 to September 3, 2013 the smell of raw sewerage emanating throughout the elevators, lobby and up to our 8th floor was outright disgusting. Throw in my casino host and hotel manager saying they didn't smell it was the last straw. I am out never coming here again :("
test_595,"This is my favorite sandwich place! The food is fresh and super delicious. I usually get a panini and chicken tortilla soup but also have enjoyed their salads.The staff is wonderful, this is a family owned business and they take pride in the services they offer. Give this wonderful place a try- you will love it!"
test_596,"Staff was very friendly. They walked us through the menu and let us sample a few items before ordering. Order came out with Cuban black beans instead of the refried beans we ordered. They were ok but did not like the sweetness of them. Food was ok. Not bad. But not amazing either. The green sauce on the emerald chicken was good on its own but overpowered everything else on the plate. All I could taste and smell was the ginger. And I love ginger. The concept of ordering everything individually for a combo is nice, but once everything is piled on top of itself it is overwhelming. The snickerdoodle at the end was yummy though. It was worth a try but not sure I will be back."
test_597,"Second time I've booked with Jeff.  This time booked for a bachelor party of 19 guys. Booked the ""don't wait in line service"" for Light Nightclub at Mandalay Bay.  A few hours before, decided to book bottle service through him.  After a back and forth we agreed on an additional $1430 for 4 bottles at a small table in an upstairs location.  Club was having a Grey Goose promotion, buy 1 get 1 free.  Great!

Showed up at club, met the guy Jeff sent. He informed us he was having problems with the club. They wouldn't do the Grey Goose promotion and if we bailed on the bottle service the club wouldn't do the ""don't wait in line entrance"" that we originally booked.  Guy who Jeff sent said this has never happened before and that Jeff was pissed.  They came to an agreement on letting us in with $1200 bar tab that we then used to buy 2 bottles.  So we ended up paying $2,570 for 2 bottles.

I understand things can go wrong, but Jeff was a dick about the whole thing and just didn't deliver on anything he booked and anything that was invoiced to me. But he took our money.  He came through on that."
test_598,This dessert is awesome for everyone all ages! It's a cool experience no other dessert can do (that I know of) I thought it was ice cream at first then the nice worker (Rosy) had given me a whole explanation of what it really is and how it all works! Great service and fun experience! Great to have for birthday parties too! I'd buy this again since they have multiple desserts to choose from and flavors.
test_599,Excellent fresh food reasonable prices the best choice in the food court as far as I'm concerned. Whatever you do avoid the Chinese place right next to it.  The Chinese place next to it  sucked a LOT.
test_600,"Oh. My. Yum. 

We stopped in to try this place near my parents new house. Soooo glad we did!

We had a chicken quesadilla which was out of this world!  The fresh flour tortilla was PERFECT - a little crunchy a little chewy!

Plus a carne asada and a fish taco. These were both SOOOO good. Finally also ordered a pork tamale which was our least favorite but was still outstanding. Everything else was just other level yummy!!  We even went back for a dozen fresh tortillas to take home. 

The prices here are reasonable, the serving sizes generous and the food was as mentioned - 
Oh. My. Yum.

As a bonus, the staff was really fast, helpful and friendly."
test_601,"If you are looking for fantastic food, drinks and service then look no further. This place has a wide range of food to suit anyone's needs! Everything's made in house and fresh as can be. Too many good things to say and nothing bad. Just go and see for yourself! Chicken kabobs and hummus are my favorite so far with many things still to try. Quit pondering and just go!!"
test_602,"Noell Tin is a HORRIBLE attorney and is no better than a thief! Noell elected to sacrifice his client and through his own client under the bus to avoid impeaching a Federal Agent who had lied at Trial.

Having been convicted, I appealed my conviction and sentence pro se (advocating on one's own behalf before a court, rather than being represented by a lawyer). I prevailed on Appeal and was scheduled to be resentenced. Before hiring Noell, I explained that I had irrefutable proof that a Federal Agent had perjured himself at my trial and I wanted that agent  cross-examined at my re-sentencing hearing. I had irrefutable proof that this Federal Agent had perjured himself and if we could prove it at re-sentencing, the Judge would have ordered a new trail and/or my immediate release since I had already served more time that I should have based upon my true culpability. 

Noell, agreed to present all of my arguments including calling the agent to the witness stand and attempting to impeach during my resentencing hearing. Based on that promise, I hired Noell to represent me at re-sentencing.

In the beginning, Noell answered my calls but that all changed once I provided him with hundreds of pages of proof of my over sentencing! I even provided Noell with a flow chart and list of questions to ask the agent, that no matter how the agent answered he would ultimately be impeached. 

During one of our calls Noell expressed some concern. After he had read all of the evidence I had provided, including the flow chart of questions to impeach the agent and seeing how iron-clad my evidence was,  Noell was worried about the Agent getting caught for perjury and possibly doing jail time?

After Noell Tin got my money and realized what kind of proof I had against this agent he began refusing to accept most my prepaid phone calls from prison; his secretaries would always put me on hold and come back with a lame excuse that he was not there or was out to lunch. Even more egregious, Noell didn't answer and/or wasn't ""in the office"" for scheduled Attorney-Client calls that had takes weeks to arrange through prison officials.

At my resentencing hearing, prior to the Court coming to order, I reiterated my request that he cross-examine and impeach the agent. Noell Tin utterly refused to call the Agent to testify (who was in the Court room)!!! Yes, re-read that... Noell Tin was more concerned for the well being of the Agent then his own client. 

Had Noell done his job and provided the Judge with the facts, by impeaching the agent, I would have been released from prison immediately! Noell botched my sentencing so bad that instead of being released immediately, I spent another two years in prison trying to undo what he messed up. Hiring Noell Tin cost me 27 extra months of my life in prison!!!!

Do not waste your money hiring Noell Tin. Hiring Noell is like giving your money to an undercover federal agent.... He obviously cares more about protecting the cops that protecting you or your loved ones.

If the readers have any question, please feel free to email me and I can provide you with hundreds of pages of letters and evidence I had sent to Noell prior to resentencing. I will even send you copies of the transcripts where I was forced to stand up and try to defend myself because he was such a bum...

DO NOT HIRE NOELL TIN!!!! You will be throwing your money away!!!"
test_603,Rachelle is so hospitable. I have been in hospitality for over 10 years and she made me feel like I was at home.    What a great location if you're at the local hotels I would recommend coming here
test_604,"First off, I feel like a social pariah for my indifference toward Stone and Vine; my entire family loves it, and yet I cannot seem to warm up to the place. Although the service is consistently adequate (especially when I go there with my dad - he likes to flirt with all the cute waitresses), the food is for the most part unremarkable.

On a lighter note, Stone and Vine is a great addition to the neighborhood. Central Scottsdale is sorely lacking in the wine bar department, so it's nice to see such a place establish itself in the area. The happy hour is pretty great as well - I am a fan of the Margherita pizza (which I believe is $6 between 5 and 7) and the Zuppa de clams. Their wine selection is limited in comparison to other wine bars, but I still have no real complaints here.

I also think it is a tad overpriced for what they serve, but they tend to appear on Groupon quite frequently ($20 for $30 worth of food - or possibly $15 for $30) which makes dining there worthwhile. It is also quite family-friendly, which is perfect for the typical clientele in the area. Overall, I would recommend giving Stone and Vine a try... the restaurant has great energy and the service is good - it also has a very local feel, which is somewhat uncommon in the central-north Scottsdale restaurant scene.

Bon apetit!"
test_605,AMC quit putting their movie times in the paper and its inconvenient to always need to have computer access to see what time a movie starts especially if you are on the go - now I go to Harkins instead.
test_606,I love this place and the workers! We did a free late night chocolate tasting. The female manager knew everything about chocolate and recommended each kind for our needs. We've gone here 2x now and will go again!
test_607,"Unfortunately I loved this place, but they seem to have changed their menu without notification online.  I took my wife there for her bday on a Saturday at 2:30.  We both looked at the menu online and decided they had what we wanted.  When we for there, we were given a totally different menu which had nothing that we had picked.  I'm guessing it was their new lunch menu.  It didn't even include their bruschetta which we love getting every time we go.  We were told we could sit at the bar for over a half an hour for their limited dinner menu to kick in, but that is unacceptable.  We ended up leaving and will probably never return since they did seem to care why we decided to leave.  A company without concern for their patrons is a company that won't get our money.

I hope in the future they decide to go back to a menu that actually has some substance, but I would bet money on them staying the course, even though it has alienated at least us as customers."
test_608,"I was surprised when I arrived at 8:30 not to find a place at the bar. After waiting for about 15 min one opened up and was immediately greeted by two lovely waitstaff. I know what I wanted after reviewing the menu online, ordering steak Christopher and the house salad, I said I would pass on the bread.  I really enjoyed the cabin salad) on of the best) with their house dressing. The steak was juicy and cooked perfectly along with some asparagus and shrimp.  This was by far the best deal on the menu. It was a bit loud but definitely a neat place to go, now one of my Cleveland favorites."
test_609,"I love chipotle and I always will. This chipotle is very subpar however, mainly because of its employees. They are young and evidently all on a different page. 

First, a couple months ago, I wait for 6 minutes while employees talk to an old employee who stopped by and ignore the line. They were paying ZERO attention to the register, while the line grew. One girl even went as far as to tell the very first customer at the register to wait one minute while she finished her conversation... REALLY!? Horrible, on all levels. 

I didn't feel the need to write about this until my incident today. 

I usually come here for lunch two times a week and have always been given my military discount, as an employee asked me the first time I came if I was military. Recently however, after ordering my food and beginning the checkout process, one employee started as usual and then was interrupted by another saying ""only if you are in uniform"". This goes against months of previous behavior, which is pretty pathetic. So I spent my $20 and will not return, not because of the lack of the discount, but the sarcastic and rude response by the interjecting employee. 

My advice? There are plenty of chipotles around, go stop at another one. And to the manager, hire and train your staff better."
test_610,"Love this place! Owner and son running the front end, so friendly, kept thanking patrons for their visit and apologizing for the wait (they were extra busy tonight). They handed out free soda to all those waiting. Give free app to new customers and shake your hand. Great customer service!"
test_611,"So far I've visited Yorkdale's Cheesecake Factory twice and both visits were pretty great. Their selection of specialty dishes and cheesecakes is so large that it is a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing what to eat, especially for someone as indecisive as myself. 

The first time I went, I tried the Chicken Madeira which was recommended by the server and the Tiramisu cheesecake. The Chicken Madeira is supposedly one of the most popular specialty items and it was really good; the chicken was very soft and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. The size of the specialty dishes are very large, however they can be a little pricey (the Chicken Madeira costs $26). Although the portions are large, it may not be quite enough for two people. I shared the Chicken Madeira with a friend, however I think we both have a small appetite and we had plenty of bread with our dish. The Tiramisu cheesecake was very nice and light--would recommend!

What's really great about the Cheesecake Factory is its unlimited bread and butter to keep you busy while you wait for your food to arrive. The servers are also pretty good at checking up on you and making sure that you have enough bread and water at all times. The servers I had during both visits were very friendly and attentive. 

Although the wait can be quite long, I'd much rather wait 1-2 hours to be seated at the Cheesecake Factory than dine at Pickle Barrel."
test_612,"I Love this place so much, I drive an hour to an hour and and a half just to go to my stylist Jessi. I have never had a bad haircut, color (which I never pick a ""normal"" color), style, or overall experience. I love the mini hand massages and facials. It really makes the whole drive worth it. The only issue is I wish I lived closer, I really have to put my whole day aside to make this trip, but it is very much worth it!!!!"
test_613,"The phrase ""Guy ate here"" seems to be popping up quite a bit around the Valley.

On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.

If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.

Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.

Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.

Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.

Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.

Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.

Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away."
test_614,"Saddest bagel toppers ever
1/2 bagel burnt; other 1/2 had completely wilted arugula and green cored tomatoes. Yes, these Bagel Toppers are new items, but quality should never be this poor."
test_615,Your candles are getting CHEAP In quality!  Most of them only burn down half way until the wicks are useless.  I have had to throw away so many that never burned down. The fragrance is also weak .... used to have great quality candles years ago but not anymore.   Glade makes better candles and actually burn completely and have a noticeable fragrance.
test_616,"The best gelato in Toronto! The flavours are always up to date (and season!) anything from pistachio (my personal favourite), tiramisu, dark chocolate, baileys and in the summer, fruity flavours like gluten free lemon. The staff is so sweet and everything is made with love!"
test_617,"YES!!!!!  An affordable venue in Las Vegas.  You seriously can't go wrong with pinball games and they offer a wide variety of classic video games from the 80s.  This isn't your new era kind of killing games, which thank the lawd I can't stand those.  

There is always onsite staff available if your machine gets jammed.  Ample parking on the side.  You are able to get here via bus.  Open long hours.  Functional restroom.  You a fully all set to play away.  Make sure to bring money cash.  Oh and if you're a germaphobe, bring your sanitizer.  

Looking forward to my next Vegas visit.  See you there!"
test_618,"Names have been obscured to preserve anonymity for the gracious as well as the grateful. 

Not only are the options for loaded french fries outstanding, but so are the wings. The ambiance is to be expected for this type of quick serve establishment, but it's just not my type of hangout. 

Service was quick and courteous, and my cousin received a courtesy above and beyond when he left his credit card there."
test_619,"Never heard of Cr√®me Glac√©e Bo-Bec, an ice cream spot, until I read about it on Montreal Eater. I decided to give them a shot on a late Thursday afternoon. 

They have 24 flavours and each flavour side is coded by colour (blue for ice cream, green for sorbet and brown for yogurt). There's also a million specials on the boards such as blizzards, milkshakes, banana splits, soft serve and drinks).

One scoop is $4.25, two scoops is $6.25 (taxes included in the price). I was able to sample two flavours before choosing. Service is a bit brisk. 

- Kulfi ($4.25 single) - never tried this before; it's a mix of Indian spices (ginger, cumin and cardamom) and four types of nuts. You get full pieces of nuts too. I tasted pecan and hazelnut. Creamy, refreshing like a chai (but better). Only unfortunate thing is it melted quickly outside.

Cash only."
test_620,"How hard is it to get orders right? I swear to god, this was my last time being really disappointed by this wendys. 

Nobody's expecting 5 star meals okay, sometimes we crave some good ol wendys. This is the one closest to my house, and the past THREE times I've gotten takeout from here they have messed up my order. I can't eat mayo and order everything without mayo, when I opened my burger what did I see? Mayo. Fries? Cold and mealy as is the new usual. Other locations manage to do a great job, what is it with this location?? I've worked in foodservice enough, I know how it is. But when I went today it wasn't even busy at all whatsoever, none of the times have been when it's busy so whyy does this wendys always mess up orders??

It's so disappointing. Wasted enough money all 3 times for food I couldn't even eat. 3 times in a row, at that. For a broke (and hungry) college student does management even understand how frustrating this is.."
test_621,"Portions will leave you crawling back to mc Donald's and send you to Dairy Queen after.

test_622,"Wow, what a great menu.  This is definitely a place for CARNIVORS!  From the mixed meats and cheeses to the awesome meatloaf.  Don't forget the pretzels and fondue.  This place has a great menu and bar selection.  I loved it.

No for the bad part, a couple in our party of 8 ordered scallops.  Six of our dinners came out in a timely fashion.  We politely waited for the pair of Scallop orders.  Food was getting cold so others started in.  After 15 minutes, we tracked down someone in the open kitchen only to find that they ran out of scallops.  No one bothered to tell my colleagues.  This was rather unacceptable and lead to my less than 5 star rating.  The ultimately ordered salads as an altternate.

It would have been only three stars, but they did ultimately recognize the issue and thee manager was ultimately quite apologetic. Hence the recovery on an additional star.

Would go back for sure."
test_623,"I have been here before and thought it was nice. The dinning room is clean and nicely decorated. The last time I came I think the owner was there.This time the waiter was a guy with a very dry personality, not very pleasant at all.At first I took it personal but I watched him interact with other customers and he was the same with them.He is in the wrong business.

I ordered the chicken padti, basil chicken and a side of egg rolls.I asked how many comes in a order, he said 6 so I said ok but he came back later and said 5.I thought that was a lot per order but when I got them I saw why, they were mini rolls like one bite each.Had I known I would not have ordered them.

He asked how spicy I wanted it.I said a 7, he said they only had 1 thru 4, I said 3. My order was to go.The food was very bland and no spice at all.I was very dissapointed. Later my stomach became upset and I spent my evening on the toilet. I know it was this food as it was the only thing I ate that day.

Very upset and dissapointed. I paid alot for the food as well.They are pretty pricey. Won't go back!!"
test_624,The staff are very friendly.  The food is good.   Nice size portions.   I would come and visit them again.
test_625,This is my go-to place for snacks/dessert/chillage time =). I've been introducing this place to friends and family ever since they opened. Best popcorn chicken hands down. I also love their ginger milk tea and snow ice dessert. Cakes are also pretty good. Would definitely recommend getting there early on Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings as they don't take reservations on weekends.
test_626,Love this place for getting my sushi fix without breaking the bank. Everything is always fresh and they are very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be back!
test_627,"Gooooood food. The staff was awesome. They give you samples of their homemade smoked sausage. When I'm in Phoenix again this place is going to be my ""go to spot""! Food coma is on!"
test_628,"Best place to eat in Vegas the morning after.  Enormous portions (""huge"" doesn't do them justice, they're so big), decent prices and a cool 80s-ish lighting scheme plays up the Vegas experience while hungover.  Fireside lounge is pretty awesome; I'd suggest having a drink or two with a small group around the fire.  The ambiance is amazing.  It's different than what you'll find in the rest of sin city.  Everything from the food to the coffee to the rainbow sugar sprinkles are fantastic.  Check it out before you leave town for home; your friends will be impressed that you know of such a ""local"" spot and you won't be disappointed.  Been coming here for years and plan to continue!  Perfect way to wrap up a weekend in Vegas.  Also, be sure to order breakfast.  Always the best."
test_629,Saddened to hear that this establishment is closed. Does anyone know anywhere else I can get a dish that I used to get here? I believe it was Drunken Noodles with crispy duck. Please let me know. One of my favorites.
test_630,"I generally think buffets are a waste of money. I mean, how many plates of food can one eat? I was with my five other girlfriends after a long night of drinking and gambling. We needed some food.

The food spread is impressive. There is really something for everyone here... breakfast, lunch and dinner foods. I stuck with the eggs benedict, shimp cocktail and some fruit, but between the six of us, we had a good sampling of food. 

The dessert section is out of control. Crembrulee, eclairs, chocolate raspberry ganace cake, profiteroles... they have it all. Next time, I will stick to this section only :)"
test_631,"I have been here over a handful of times now so it's time to review. For me its a nice and convenient place to hit up after work. I have never had a bad experience. I went here a few times during the World Cup to have some food and beers with friends while we watched the game. The outdoor patio in the back in amazing, such a great place to hang out with friends! The food has always impressed me especially the fritters, the tacos, the sweet potato fries, the lobster mac n cheese sliders, and the mussels. I always love their selection of beers. It was great when they had the beer flights special so you can try four different ones. Overall a great atmosphere and a great place to get together with friends and share some food and drinks."
test_632,"The Clothes Mentor store in Strongsville, Ohio is a complete rip off and the owner, Randi Z. is rude and snobbish beyond words!! They offer one third of their selling price. You are better off selling your items online, or better yet, donate to Goodwill."
test_633,Had a nail in my tire and came to Comstock without an appointment. Service was prompt and reasonable. I was really glad they were there when I needed them!
test_634,"I was pretty stoked that a Wahoo's restaurant opened up near me. Some friends really hyped it up. Unfortunately, my order of cajun fish tacos came super late and the fish was very dry and bland. It was not an anomaly because both of my friends' fish dishes were dry as well. Did I expect too much out of this place? Not too excited about coming back and trying their other dishes. I mean, they're called Wahoo's FISH tacos. If they can't do fish right, why bother?

UPDATE: Went back and tried the carne asada beef. It was gray in color and bland. Seriously, not grilled - gray. After the meal, I had a stomach ache. Coincidence? I think not."

test_636,"We went there with my husband for NYE while visiting Phoenix. We knew they had a special 4 course dinner which we made the reservation for but unfortunately our airplane was delayed. We called to see what they can do and even though they said their kitchen was closing very soon they went above and beyond to help us out. We ended up being an hour late so they could not serve all 4 courses,  but Christian (one of the owners) was super helpful, served us more than we expected and gave us special discount. The food was amazing (I got the fillet mignon and my husband the sea bass), the service was excellent, the wine great too, the environment so warm and romantic. I would absolutely recommend it and will certainly be going back. Thank you Christian!"
test_637,"I was introduced to this salon by a co-worker, and decided to check it out as it was conveniently located close to home.

The salon itself was clean and organized, one half being a hair salon and the other half for nails/spa. Made an appointment with Vivian (as recommended) for a shellac manicure and regular pedicure. Although I arrived fairly early prior to the appointment, I was pressured and rushed into choosing my polishes. She stood beside me as I flipped through the swatches which was uncomfortable. Finally settled for OPI's ""Dont Bossa Nova Me Around"" since it was a ""popular colour"" as she suggested. Despite my feeling of being rushed, she was very thorough with her work and was satisfied with her attention to detail. 

Made an appointment four weeks later for the same services. I did not specify anyone in particular for this appointment as I wanted to give an unbiased review. Joyce helped me out the second time around and was very attentive, although her work was not as thorough. I'm usually not finicky with my nails but my thumbnail wasn't as smooth and did not cure properly. 

Overall fairly impressed with the salon. Rated 3 stars because the quality of your nails really depend on the person doing it. I arrived at least 10-15 minutes for both appointments, and was rushed into choosing my polishes both times. Although I can't speak for walk-ins, there were plenty of staff working both Saturday afternoons visited and customers were accommodated right away. Price for shellac manicure and regular pedicure in total was $60 plus tax which was pretty average - but you get what you pay for."
test_638,"Some years ago I lived right down the street from this great place, and unfortunately when I moved, I kinda forgot about it. When I needed fish recently, I got to experience the joy of rediscovering it. Since I was there last, they expanded and now dedicate a whole room to aquaria. They have a marvelous selection, and the gentleman who assisted me was helpful in guiding my selections. They also carry birds, reptiles, and small mammals, all of whom looked very lively. If you only want low prices, go to one of the chains. If you want knowledge and carefully curated pets, come here."
test_639,Cassie our server did a magnificent job she was always ahead of the thing she brought food before we were ready for it she brought drinks before they were empty it was delightful the food was also very good very filling
test_640,"My dad and I went to try Union since it is next to his office and he liked his prior experience. I would give a note of 3.5/5.

Atmosphere : 3.5/5 

Vintage Industrial Decor, exposed light bulbs, woodplanks and metal galore. Are we re-inventing the wheel here? No but it's still a nice disposition. Background music present but you are still able to hold a conversation. Dinning room and restroom are clean. 

Service : 5/5 

Our waitress had a shadow apprentice with her and they were both very pleasant, attentive, they came often to make sure we were happy and most importantly; they graciously laughed at my dad's jokes. 

Food : 3/5

We both ordered the Steak Frites. This plate has potential. On the plus side, the fries and the mayonnaise were very good. I also enjoyed the garlic butter and peppercorns on the steak. The aforementioned steak was cooked as specified and was tender for a sirloin. However, the steak sizes were inconsistent. While my dad had a standard portion, my steak was rather small. There could have been more fries and the presentation slightly more professional. My steak was literally thrown on the fries with a big blank space still on the plate. 

On the recommendation of our waitress,my dad ordered the chef's feature dessert ; the blueberry and basil cr√™me brul√©e. Oh yes please! I went with her other suggestion ; the Mars Bar brownie. 

Alas, my dad's enjoyment of his dessert stopped at the first spoonful. The crust seemed legit, but as soon he broke it, it was more like a soup than a cr√™me brul√©e. Very liquid, not rich or unctuous at all. Thankfully, the waitress arrived just at the right moment and she agreed, the dessert had to be changed. He instead went for the cheesecake and I have to say it was fairly good. 

As for my brownie, I was pleased by it. Generous portion and a good mix of flavor. 

The waitress was gracious enough to comp both the cr√™me/soup and the cheesecake of our tab. 

Union has great potential. They only have to work on food consistency and learn how to make a decent cr√™me brul√©e. Especially since it's the chef's featured dessert."
test_641,"Came here after searching Yelp for nearby restaurants while visiting my boyfriend's family in Chandler.  Little did we/they know that this awesome Chinese restaurant exists just feet from their door.  It was a Sunday night and the restaurant was about 60% full on arrival and to the max when we left (so takeout may be recommended).

We devoured several good dishes shared among the table:
Pork potstickers
Mongolian beef
Sweet and sour pork
House special fried noodles
Eggplant with pork and garlic sauce

The potstickers started us off on the right foot, some of the best I have had and we saw them being made later during the meal in house.  The pork and beef dishes were arguably great standards while the house noodles came with three meats and was huge and delicious and the eggplant was succulent and well flavored.  We surprisingly had no leftovers which is usually a very good sign in a Chinese restaurant.  Walked away with just over a $40 bill which is a remarkably good deal.  Loved dinner here!"
test_642,"My little kids (5 and 2) love teppanyaki but most places roll their eyes when we come in and don't even give us a chance.  Not here.  They were awesome with out kids, asked us to wait so they could seat us with folks that were compatible (which is great, cause I don't want to sit with some couple who is out to dinner to get away from their kids.  So, food good, staff good...all around a great experience.  Our go-to teppanyaki from now on."
test_643,"I finally had the opportunity to visit the famous Peppermill restaurant and I was not disappointed. My first night in Vegas I was hungry after attending a concert so we decided  to eat breakfast here. We were seated on  the diner side, the decor is retro and I loved it. I also returned to the Peppermill my second night because I wanted to visit their fireside lounge for cocktails. I know sometimes restaurants don't live up to the hype, this is one lives up to the hype"
test_644,"After arriving in Vegas and shopping in one of the big name stores and not sure of the price I called The Gun Garage, I asked them if they had what I was looking for and they said they did, they gave me direction to the shop. When we arrived we met the gentleman I spoke to on the phone and he showed me exactly what I was looking for. He took the time and patients to explain all my options for the optics I could purchase and went the extra mile and helped me make the correct choice for my application. Then he took all the correct mounts and the optic and mounted it all for me, he was not pushy and was extremely helpful. The Gun Garage got me set up with all the correct paperwork and made the transaction a pleasure plus saved me a ton of money over what the big name store was going to charge me. I live four hours away from The Gun Garage but will use them for all my future purchases. The Gun Garage is the only place to go they are friendly, helpful and have awesome prices. The next day we went back and the owner set my wife up on the range with a full auto and she had a blast, now she is sold on the Gun Garage as well. Thank you Gun Garage you and your staff is a pleasure to work with, you have earned another satisfied client who will be using you for all our needs.
Thank you
Greg & Mary"
test_645,"Fitting in fitness at home is hard enough (ok that's a lie as I live in gyms and can teach numerous fitness formats) but when traveling for work it's almost impossible.  Small hotel gyms with dated/broken equipment is pretty common.  I was prepping for a pretty dull workout over the next two days.  Instead I found this awesome fitness studio!

Spoke [N] Spin is a hidden gem.  It's tucked inside an Aloft hotel on a not so-pretty-street lined with mid range lodging chains. I'm not certain how its linked to this SPG property (I also don't really care).  You use MindBody to sign up and pay; you don't pay through the hotel.  It's boutique fitness pricing ($20 a class, they do packages).  They offer a few classes a day.  Spinning and TRX!!!  Combined.  Tonight I took a 50 min spin and TRX shoulders and core class.  They also do spin/yoga and spin\trx lower body classes.  This wasn't a fitness-light class for the inexperienced (beginners are welcome and you can take at your own pace).  It was a challenging ride that ended with 15 min of TRX pull ups, pushups, planks and other ab work.  LOVE!  Space has a kick-ass sound system and it set up like the usual spin studio.  The have bikes/straps for twenty.  The only downfall of this place is that there is no ventilation.  The air is stale and thick.  Other than that I wish there was a 6 am class I could take tomorrow morning!"
test_646,"Good service. A bit pricey but still a value. Huge menu available 24 hours. The late night after party crowd is like a complimentary variety show. Gotta go if you haven't. Oh, and love the sugar!"
test_647,"2nd time I've used them. First to check out an RV I was buying and they saved me from being ripped off and now to work on my manifold. Make sure your ok with the service call and paying for the required 1 hr but before you make a decision you need to know these people don't take longer because they are hourly, are HONEST, and great at what they do. Tyler help us this time and John before that. Tyler showed up on time, was easy to deal with and pointed out some other issues for the future that might need repair. They actually repaired what another mechanic said they had repaired and for much less! If you're traveling, like me, they don't take advantage knowing they won't see you again. Thanks again!!"
test_648,"On my latest trip to Las Vegas I stayed in THEhotel and ended up going to Border Grill 3 times.  It is just that good.  If you are staying at Mandalay Bay or THEhotel you HAVE to go to Border Grill.

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.  

The service was also amazing.  We had a group of 10 and it was very fast even with the large group.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  

Overall the food is inventive and delicious.  If you are in Las Vegas you should definitely try Border Grill especially for the brunch.  AMAZING!"
test_649,"After all the hype and raves, I have to say that the Bellagio dinner buffet (our first meal in Vegas), was a big disappointment.  I felt that the food selection was a little weak and the flavors and quality on the low end of the scale.  The only thing that made up for the lack of good hot food was the amazing dessert bar, which featured some insanely good desserts.

Honestly, I can't remember much of what I had, because most of it tended to be over-cooked.  The only thing that was really good was the fresh lamb/beef gyros, which were carved straight off the rotating, vertical spit.  Unfortunately, the meat was ready only every 10-15 minutes (an eternity at a buffet) and there wasn't much of it each time they carved it.  You had to be fast, or the meat would run out.  Extra points for having mini-pitas and a full bar of condiments, such as sliced tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki, and crumbled feta cheese.  I also appreciated their sushi bar, which had tuna poke and tuna sashimi, which was fresh and very good.    

Bellagio's carving station offered a large variety of meats, from the standard prime rib and lamb to more ""exotic"" fare, such as bison and beef wellington, which later turned into chicken wellington.  I tried the prime rib, the bison, and the beef wellington, all of which were lacking in flavor.  The prime rib was a tad overdone, even from the center, and the seasoning, which made for a good tasting crust, didn't penetrate to the center of the meat.  The bison and beef wellington were both tough and over-cooked.  It was my first time trying bison and while I think it had potential, it was just too tough for me to enjoy.  Likewise, the beef wellington, which had a good pastry crust, was too dry.

And now for the desserts, which were all delicious.  The creme brulee, which I had 3 of (yes, I know, I'm a pig), came with a perfectly crisp, carmelized crust, which I delighted in cracking with my spoon.  Delicious.  Next up was a key lime pie - it was deliciously tart and smooth.  Likewise, the lemon meringue pie was amazing, with a nicely browned meringue on top.  There were other desserts as well, all of which were good, presumably because the man behind Jean Philippe Patisserie is overseeing all the desserts at the Bellagio.

All in all, an okay buffet.  The desserts were outstanding, but the other foods were a disappointment.  If you can eat $35+ worth of pastries and perhaps nibbles of sushi, gyro, cocktail shrimp, and pasta, then Bellagio is the place to go.  Otherwise, for a more complete, overall Vegas buffet experience, I would head out to the Wynn, Paris, or Mandalay Bay."
test_650,What a mess. Been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me. Should've stuck with the company I usually use....next counter or two over. Came here based on SW Airlines suggestion and email. Ugh
test_651,"Local, casual, good food. Hubby and I stopped for a bite at the bar and were greeted by the owner. I had the salmon, which frankly is never that amazing when eating out. But I must say this salmon was very good. Cooked just how I asked it to be. I had veggies on the side which were a little too heavy on the garlic but still a nice mix of colors. My hubby had chicken parm and said it was delicious. It certainly looked it. I like the atmosphere and the fact that it's right down the road. Great wine and bar selection as well!"
test_652,"Very professional friendly place. I Recommend everyone! Great artists, my tattoo artist is Steve. If you want a star wars, batman, or comic book related art he is your man!"
test_653,"Not impressed. I went in to have two pairs of pants hemmed. My wife (who DOES know how to sew but is too busy working to sew these for me) pinned the pants at the correct length. The lady at Ale Maria's basically refused to sew them because she didn't want to chance that the hem would be wrong. I agreed that I would even sign a waiver so she could get started, but no.

So, now I have to find another tailor/alteration shop to do my work.

Update:

I took my pants to Kim's Custom Tailor Etc 7023 N Litchfield Rd
Glendale, AZ  85307. My pants were done in two days and they are perfect! Thank you Ale Maria's for turning me down. I found a place closer to my house that does great work!"
test_654,"Perfect service. Always a great place to eat! had Dylan as my server he made us great cocktails, an Acai Shandy and a Prickly Pear Lemonade. The cocktails made our horrible movie at the movie fest a little better. :) We also love Josh Berk he always hooks it up fatty style.. Josh really hooks it up. So does Bill."
test_655,"Keep in mind this is not high end sushi. However, for the price and the style, it is good. It is the conveyor belt style sushi. Grab what you want and pay by the plate. If you want something you don't see, they will make it for you."

test_658,"As a woman with Asian and Mediterranean skin, I have to be extremely cautious with regard to skincare treatments. I can't simply trust anyone who is a self-proclaimed expert in ""ethnic skin.""  Thus, I would always wait until I went back to New York City to see my usual Japanese and Chinese aestheticians, whom I know are capable of working with olive and yellow skin. 

However, since moving to the desert, my skin has spiraled out of control and I was in desperate need of help just before my wedding. I suffer from adult acne (cystic, hormonal, overall awful) and I needed someone to help me turn my skin around before the big day. That's when I found Jennifer, and decided to take a chance. She saw me just twice in the weeks leading to my wedding and was able to get my skin smooth and glowing for the most important day of my life thus far. 

Since the wedding, I have continued to treat with Jennifer and my skin has only gotten better and better. I thought I was going to have to live with my acne for the rest of my life and that it was something that I would have to learn to accept - but not anymore. My self-esteem has improved and I feel that my whole life has changed. If you suffer from acne and have felt completely hopeless, then you know how I used to feel. 

Ladies with acne, olive, or yellow skin - you can trust Jennifer with the utmost confidence for all your skincare needs."
test_659,"This place is about a 10 min walk from the Park Hyatt so we tried it for a Saturday Brunch. The food is pretty average but done well. I had the 2 eggs any style $8.25 and subbed with a side of fruit +$2.25. For $10.50 I got 2 eggs and a small bowl of fruit - kinda pricey and then there was a basket of bread for us to share which was pretty good. The over easy eggs were cooked properly and the fruit was good. My husband enjoyed the omlette but didn't rave about it. Coffee was pretty good and refilled frequently. 

overall experience was good."
test_660,"Nous nous y sommes arr√™t√©s pour le brunch  le we pass√©. Bilan : sans plus.
Les assiettes sont correctes mais la qualit√© laisse √† voir : le jambon brais√© goutait l'eau, la salade n'√©tait pas fraiche, les oeufs poch√©s √©taient franchement pas bons. En revanche les pancakes √©taient bons ainsi que le pain perdu."
test_661,In AZ from Chicago. Ordered the sandwich called Farmhouse something.... and it was delicious. Customer service was friendly!
test_662,"Dr Venter is wonderful and highly knowledgeable. 

 I am extremely disappointed by the professionalism of the front end staff. I called at 3pm on a Friday to see if I could pop in to the clinic instead of going to a walk in. The receptionist said yes as long as I was there by 4pm. I arrived around 3:30 and checked in. Shortly after another patient arrived. I over heard him state that he too had just called and just booked the appointment for a skin irritation. He was taken to the back while I sat and waited my turn. At 3:50 the receptionist called me back to the desk and said that unfortunately Dr Venter wouldn't have time to see me and that I could book an appointment 3 days later. The reason for my visit is I was concerned I had fractured my hand and was simply wanting a referral to get an X-ray. This whole ordeal made me super frustrated in the lack of organization and inconvenience."
test_663,"I have been twice so far and service is friendly and knowledgeable which is refreshing for counter service. Really solid craft beer selection and super cool interior design.

That being said, the burgers were on point as well. So far I had the Tomago burger and went in just yesterday and tried the burger with shitake mushrooms. I added cheese and bacon and it was even better than the Tomago burger. And don't get me started on the jazzy fries. 

I will definitely be back for more. Keep up the great work guys!"
test_664,"Have had two not so great experiences here. The first was with a substitute veterinarian who was more busy selling me unneeded veterinarian services to actually treat my cat. They even did a blood test without my permission and then expected me to pay for it! Now I decided to come back when the cat didn't get better so that they could redeem themselves and the actual vet, didn't seem to want to hear it. They refused to give me a refund on the blood test. Not great business practices and they didn't even seem to care about it!"
test_665,"This is a tiny market but filled with lots of goodies. When you walk in there is a ""coffee shop"" on your right. On your left is a mini French bakery-the main item being macaroons. There is a small cold case that has a nice variety of beer. There is a deli case with prepared foods. Everything looked tasty. There is a small freezer with a few types of icecream. One was a local Pittsburgh ice cream. Way to represent!!  There is a dairy case and then a section where you could grab premade sandwiches and salads.  The prices are a bit high but the quality of their items make it worth it. If I lived downtown this is definitely where I would shop."
test_666,"Amazing food! Great service, friendly staff. Located right behind In n Out and not easily seen. Best Mexican food in Vegas."
test_667,"All experience with National Stone was just awesome!!!! From first moment when I called them to get estimate and last moment when I paid, shake Zane's hand and leaved very happy. Their customer service, care for customer and taste were unbelievable. Jim came to my house at my requested time (at 7am). Theresa, Zane and MO helped me to choose the perfect quartz for my shiny white kitchen from IKEA and save lots of money (what is a big plus:))). My kitchen was done very quick and neat. I definitely will go back to them again and will recommend to all my friend."

test_671,"It was fine.  The salon and atmosphere are a bit ragtag and not comfortable.
Haircut was good.  The presentation is rough though."
test_672,"Highly recommended for the pies...you can buy them by the slice or entire pies.

I had breakfast and there are tons of options on the menu...almost anything you would want.  I especially enjoyed the numerous egg white options.  Its not ultra fancy...standard American breakfast. 

Server was friendly and manager stopped by the table to make sure all was great."
test_673,"This was an awesome gastropub! We went here yesterday for a date night and were not disappointed! There was a little bit of a wait if you wanted an actual table but it wasn't long and it was a Saturday night so what else can you expect. Our waiter was great. He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer. He also let us know about the specials they offer throughout the week. We ordered the kale Caesar salad, bangers and mash, and bison burger. Everything was fantastic! My fianc√© enjoyed his beers as well. The service was also very quick but we didn't feel rushed or anything.    We also loved the atmosphere and the decor. We would definitely come back here. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu."
test_674,"One of the better clubs I've been to!  The people seem nicer and more down to earth.  Good music, good set up, good service, good drinks, same pricing.  It's not as packed as the other clubs, so if you'd like to go to a place where you don't get smooshed between two sweaty people, definitely give this place a try!!!"

Ginger asked me what I wanted, fired up the laptop, and off we went to Pintrest looking for exactly what I wanted! She did a fantastic job, saved me $30 vs Santa Fe, and I laughed the entire time talking to her, the owner, and Michelle. I LOVE this place and would recommend them to anyone and everyone! Please.. if your looking for a fashionable new hair style in a comforting fun atmosphere for a very reasonable price..Flict is the place to go!"
test_676,By far the worst Best Buy in Vegas. Terrible customer service. Went in there twice in a week to buy a camera. No one approached us once- first time in there I had to search for an employee to assist us in buying the camera. Then when we asked about the best camera to use for Vlogging she had no idea what it was. lol Every time I go in there I'm constantly disappointed with the disengaged and bored employees. I will drive an extra 20 minutes just to go to a Best Buy with 10x better customer service.
test_677,I love Q Karaoke so I decided to eat at QBistro for the first time! I loved it. When you walk in they have a really nice seating area with booths and one side with half booths half tables. They have Kpop music videos playing and pretty decor in here. The food on the menu is sooooo good. They have a variety of everything. We ordered the bulgogi pizza an order of baked mussels and mozzarella sticks. The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10! I ordered the frozen strawberry daiquiri with apple reds and my boy ordered the mango with mikes hard lemonade! So good! I will definitely have to come back and try more!
test_678,"I am surprised at some of these reviews as well.

Just returned to the states from my first visit to the lovely city of Toronto, and this was the only brewpub I was able to visit. While I had hoped to visit a more ""beery"" place, I was with my wife and mother-in-law so this place seemed to be a good compromise for the three of us. Visited on a crowded Friday Night.

My wife ordered the Thai salad, my mother in law opted for the chicken and ribs, and I went for the braised pork shank, replete with baked potato and sauerkraut. We all gave the food high marks. Not the best we've ever had, but damn good. Not a complain amongst us. 

My wife and I ordered the beer sampler, and both agreed that all styles were up to snuff. After deciding that I favored the amber, I ordered a full litter mug - which for being in a big city in the heart of downtown was a great deal at $9.50. (or close to it) With a full litter mug of excellent beer and the meal I had to drink it with, I was in heaven. The three of us agreed we had made the right choice, and got a great value for our tourist dollar. I will go back here the next time I'm able to travel to Toronto.

When I think back to my three days in Toronto, that litter mug of Three Brasseurs Amber and the Hockey Hall of Fame are what I'll remember most."
test_679,"waited almost a month for a microwave because the cabinet spacer was unavailable, turns out the reason it was so hard to get is it was the wrong spacer for a different appliance.  Add to it the very unpleasant woman at the register that the sales guy passed us off to.  Add to that they didn't call when they flaked on the first delivery, called 1/2 hour into the window the second delivery to say they are going to flake,  the third time took all morning at my house to find out the unpleasant girl and appliance guy were unable to match the right spacer with the right appliance. 
 
To the manager at best buy,  my time is valuable.  Your inept handling of sales have wasted hours and hours my time, and your staff could really care less.  The only gratification is to know that you lost money on this non-sale and you still have to pay the installer.

I learned a good lesson though, why would customers go to your store when we can buy  online easier and more accurately and skip the ugly attitude from your staff?    If (probably when) your store goes broke and then closes you shouldn't be too surprised."
test_680,This is probably the worst steakhouse. Been twice and had to send back my steak both times. First time ordered Pittsburgh style rare and got a charred steak med. Second time was a NY striploin wrapped in bacon on special and I ordered rare and received med well. Waitress told me to eat the middle. Excuse me but I want to eat the whole steak and enjoy it. Sent it back. Garlic bread is good though. Too bad I sat and watched my dinner date eat while I waited. Killed the mood and was his bday. Will never go back. I'd spend the extra cash and go to any other steakhouse. Always give one chance to  every restaurant. My dinner date ordered the prime rib and was satisfied with med rare cut and a large portion. At least he had a good meal for his bday. Just not happy being told to only eat the center. Not good customer service. That was rude.
test_681,"This place use to be burger and gelato  until recently when it became pkaros after several months of  renovation. 

The interior has an orange and white motif with wood tones that are reminiscent  of the old capitanos. 

There is a gelato bar and a selection of deserts, macaroons, cakes, etc.

The burger was substantial in quantity. The taste was pretty good, for $15 I would expect something top notch."
test_682,"This place used to be 5 stars no question.

Right now, the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of one is because of the great poker room and restaurants they have.  I'm talking about the restaurants Thomas Keller, Emeril Legasse, Wolfgang Puck, and others run.  Not their room service or anything like that.

The rooms are still awesome but the service has become flat out awful.  When I checked in for a littler poker holiday (I live in Las Vegas) my upgraded room (which I'm paying $100/night extra for) didn't have a working minibar or safe in there.  Ok normally no big deal...I call the front desk and ask for someone to come in and fix that.  I come back at 5:30 am from playing poker and nobody had been in the room.

The next day, I again leave my room and ask for housekeeping to come in and clean as well as do the installations.  I come back about 5 hours later and nothing.  What?!?!  Call the front desk and they say they will send a housekeeping supervisor.  Ok great thanks!  10 minutes later she arrives.

I can best describe her reaction to my call as ""meh.""  Listen Yelpers, I am not a complainer about service or whatever.  I don't need much.  But when I heard her excuse that a housekeeper DID TRY to come into my room but her KEY DIDN'T WORK I almost laughed out loud.  Really?  My key works but her master key didn't work?  Then why didn't she get someone else to come and use their key?  Because I specifically asked for housekeeping before I left since I needed to do some work afterwards.  Real reason no housekeeping came?  They just didn't bother.  If they key really wasn't working they would have found a way to remedy that or left a message on my phone for me in the room.  What a joke.

Also, asked the supervisor to look into the missing minibar and safe.  Her reaction.  ""meh""  Actually it was ""oh this is weird.  Sometimes things are in different places with this suite than others""  Ok...so we search the room and don't find anything.  Her reaction?  ""Meh.""  No promise to get them installed correctly.  She just says ""That's strange.""  

""That's strange"" = ""Meh""

My past love of The Venetian?!?!  Meh."

test_684,"i am so angry with this store. we consigned our nordic-track eliptical in may. they sold it for $250, we were supposed to be notified and given $100. we weren't notified that it was sold. infact i almost forgot about it because we moved across the county mid-June. then i remembered sometime late june that we consigned our eliptical. i called them, and they had said yes in fact it did sell. i asked them to mail me the check for $100. they said it wasn't going to  be easy. they didn't have checks, and that the owner would have to write a check. Really? it's bad enough that they didn't call me to let me know my item was sold and to come and get my $$fee. it is almost like they were banking on their customer to forget and move on. then that's $250 in their pocket. right? We'll i've called 3x, spoke with the manager brian. He's promised that the check was going to be in the mail. it's now the end of August, and NOTHING. I am ready to call the BBB. when your business completely relies on the sales from other people, it's not good business to NOT GIVE THEM THEIR MONEY! terrible business model. terrible business practice. If i were buying sports equipment, i'd buy from Craigslist or through one of Madison's resale facebook groups. at least most of the people there are honest."
test_685,"Wanting to get a quick breakfast in our hotel before hitting the pool, my friend and I decided to make our way downstairs to the crepe place. When we arrived, there was a line but not too unbearably long. The line however, took a deceptively long time. Once we finally got our crepes they were pretty good. My friend ordered the bananas foster crepe and I got the tomato and cheese crepe. Both of these crepes were very good."
test_686,"My daughter and I met with Byron, one of the owners, for a consultation about seven weeks before we actually got our tattoos. From the start Byron was helpful with guiding us on our initial designs. The day of he and his staff were courteous with the entire process. Byron and his design input was something that I did not experience in my first two experiences at other shops. He made sure our designs incorporated everything we wanted, but with not being overdone or to convoluted. We were both completely happy with both of our designs and the end product. I will definitely be using Byron and his shop for my next tattoo."

test_690,"Be adventurous and take a break from the usual dimsum options for vegetarian dimsum. Get pro level status and order before 12am to get the S, M, L options at one low price of $2.88!! XL dishes are still $5.60.... but at least you can fill up on the other stuff first. 

Dim sum recommendations would be the Veg. Crispy Rice Roll, Crystal Clear Dumplings and maybe try their version of BBQ Bun to see if you can give up actual BBQ. Desserts are not overly sweet but tends to rely on the natural flavouring for the fruits or the texture of nuts to deliver some delight. Perfect examples would be the Sweeten Pancakes with Walnuts and Cashew or the Mango Mochi. Dishes are on the smaller side but delicately made with attention to presentation and detail."
test_691,"Sit down or on the fly China Tango quickly became my go-to Chinese restaurant in the Green Valley area. 

Absolutely love their chow mein and sweet & sour chicken. Pro tip regarding sweet & sour chicken....most places give you the sauce on the side and refuse to mix it in the wok. I hate that. China Tango is more than happy to mix it in the wok so you're not left dipping when you get home. 

They give you so much food it's ridiculous. A 2 item combo is enough for two people plus left overs. Most Chinese restaurants (other than Panda) have a lunch menu then cut off all the combos for dinner time. Not China Tango. Their meal-deal is available all the time. Entree, side item (fried/white rice or chow mein), cup of soup, egg roll and crab rangoon. 

Another cool thing, when you order to go they give you your food in a box if it's a large order. Keeps it from sloshing all over the place on the drive home and is a really nice touch to keep things steady. Appreciate the extra effort that they give. 

Far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area."
test_692,Roadrunner is great!  They installed some really modern windows in a project I am working on in PV.  They found solutions while the framing for the windows weren't done correctly.  Visit their showroom they have good displays of work they have done.

test_695,"If you enjoy charcoal grilled skewers from Taste of Asia or Night it Up back in the good ol' summer days, this is the place to satisfy your cravings! 

Decided to try here on a Monday night with JW. There were actually still people waiting for table when we left. Imagine the weekends... packed like sardines in a small, stuffy, charcoal filled environment. No, thanks!

Ordered the lamb, beef and garfish to share. They served the skewers on a heated platform over candles... I thought the presentation was pretty neat :) 

The flavour was spot on but it gets a bit boring when all the food had the SAME spice rub taste. I would love more variety... maybe a good dipping sauce to go along? The lamb and beef tasted exactly the same... just that the lamb was more tender. I'd come back just for the lamb skewers. Garfish was crispy, the meat was soft and tender... but I have had better ones at Oriental Gourmet.

We did wait close to an hour from our first lamb skewers to the remaining orders. Now I understand why it is called Chat Bar. JW and I literally chatted for 45 mins to an hour before the food came lol.

We almost refused to pay tips for the minimal service. The waitstaff were courteous and friendly... but we had to fetch our own drinks from the beer/pop fridge in the front counter and open it ourselves. They charge you after you consume. Bottled water is complimentary. It is a nice feature where it makes you feel like home... I might as well just fetch my food too? Our tips should solely be for the hardworking kitchen staff, sniffing charcoal all day IMO.

I would come back for lamb skewers takeout. I know it is overpriced ($5.95/4 pcs) but you gotta do what you gotta do when your craving hits lol.

P.S. Brush up your mandarin before coming here! You'll need it."
test_696,"Amazing, amazing place!  Excellent staff that was able to accommodate my party of 15 after my wife's college graduation the day of. Food was perfect!  I highly recommend eating here."
test_697,"Ok. I've decided next time I enter the Kiehl's area of the cosmetic section to simply take a Sharpee and write SUCKER across my forehead. Those fancy ladies with their fancy smocks, see two gay guys headed their way and I can see the dollar signs replacing their pupils. KA CHING! Really, I just need a face lotion. Hmmm....17 different kinds. All with hard to pronounce extracts and oils. Do I need the Fortifying Baobab skin therapy? Or maybe the Centella Recovery skin salve. Or perhaps the Creamy Avocado Eye treatment? Ok, I could pronounce avocado. And yes, I tasted it. Nothing like guacamole. I get great customer service here. I'm not intimidated like other folks seem to be. Gimme a break. They're retail workers. Nothing wrong with that at all. Then why do I know so many people who won't go there cuz they're ""afraid"" of the employees. Get a spine people. And while you're there, I'm sure you'll find some kind of spine lotion or salve. 
The men's department is fantastic as well. I pretty much only shop there when I see those wonderul CLEARANCE signs calling my name. 
BEST PART OF Needless Mark up is the FREE valet parking. Nothing worse than circling the narrow parking garage across the street. I ALWAYS use the valet service here even when I'm not shopping at Neiman's. Oh, and leave the Visa and MasterCard at home, cuz they don't take them. I know that makes people crazy. But c'mon, it's a Dallas based store....need I say more!"
test_698,"This is my favorite athletics store in Charlotte. The staff are always friendly, well trained, polite and knowledgeable. If you need shoes, this is the place to go! Also, the staff here has low turnover and knows their customers. We did a scavenger hunt for my kids and stopping at omega gave a critical clue. The staff there went above and beyond to make it a special experience (decorated the box w the clue in it). Omega also gives back to the Charlotte community; highly recommend!"
test_699,"I signed up for Yelp just to write this. I often go to NYPD for dinner/lunch. I love their food, its delicious. But today, I had a really good experience. I ordered carryout because my house is not close enough for delivery. I arrived, got my food and left. Well, it was awfully busy and when I got home I noticed they forgot my salad I ordered. I called back, and, they offered to drive out to my house (which is not in their delivery range) and deliver me personally my forgotten salad. Soon enough, a woman was at my door, salad in hand along with a coupon for a free dessert. I honestly cannot express how kind this was. It makes me happy that I can go somewhere with good food AND extreamly good service.

Thank you!"
test_700,"This place was recommended to us by another family at our school and everything they said about it is true. It's very clean, the staff is very friendly, and Dr. Santucci does a great job of explaining their evaluation and results.

test_701,"Be careful here. You don't have any rights due to this being a Indian casino. This place took my mom winning away from her. My mom went to dinner there with a girl friend and after went and played a slot. After about 30 minutes of play a casino employee came over and asked for her ID. Once the employee had her ID he told her that she needed to come with him. After ask him why several times he finally answered. They said some lady had money in the machine my mom was playing. Witch I don't get why if someone had money in a machine why would you walk away from it? My mom put $40 in and after 30 minutes got it up to $200. Once they got into some room they took her to. They gave her two options witch were give the money back, or they would arrest her. My mom has never been in trouble and was very scared. This place must be going broke if they need to scare little old lady's and take them in a mafia style back room and press her to give the money she won far and square. Shame on you. If you want to go to a place that will make u give back the money you won and were you have no rights then go to this casino."
test_702,"Woodlands is my go-to for some soul satisfying South-Indian food! My favorite is the mysore masala dosa (indian style crepes coated with a spicy sauce, filled with potatoes), followed by the south indian thali (which gives you the opportunity to try many different dishes) The dosas are always crispy and delicious (delicious partly because of the high sodium levels - hey, no one said the food was healthy! :) ) and of all the items in the 'thali', I love the rasam - it's equal parts tangy as spicy! the hubs loves the north indian thali; it's a great way to sample some really good north indian food. I'd recommend Woodlands to anyone looking for a wide range of delicious vegetarian food! It's a simple restaurant, service is quick and the food always tastes fresh. They can up the level of spiciness if you request it, and they're not kidding if you ask for your food to be spicy! :)"
test_703,"Fantastic Thai food!

I ate here last weekend and have been thinking about the meal ever since. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is definitely not a place you go for the ambiance - tile floors, few decorations, picnic quality tables. That said, there were 11 of us for dinner and our service, if bare bones, was polite, efficient, and timely. You could do worse.

In future I will get take out and love it. We had a bunch of dishes (noodles, rices, curry, spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken, seafood, veggies) and everything was delicious. Except the pad thai. The pad thai was actually pretty abysmal and I'd skip it if I were you. Get anything else - all of our other dishes were great. There was variety in the flavours of the dishes, just the right level of spice, and plenty of meat/veg in everything.

This place is a total find. My new go-to Thai place."
test_704,"I'm four treatments in and I am getting great results.  I don't know about the other reviewers but this location has gone out of their way to be nice and certainly has not tried to ""over-sell"". They have been on time every time and I'm literally in and out with the next appointment scheduled in less than 15-20 minutes.  I wish it were a bit closer to my home but I would recommend. Also- pricing was very reasonable."

test_707,"Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent, there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state. 

My girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious. 

Entrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion. 

The place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting, wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic."
test_708,"For a super fast pizza it's actually really good.  Great for families who loath typical ""fast food"" and need to grab something quick between activities."
test_709,Food was great! Loved the market and seeing things I love imported from Italy! Employees could learn to smile and be more friendly. Heard from other customers that it is usually like this and to expect it when you go.
test_710,"Did a pick up order on Friday fully expecting the soft open menu, but luckily it was their full menu. 
Rather than go with original orders, just ordered a bunch of items cuz ya gotta give it a try. 
The Pulled Pork was Delicious! I personally liked it better than their competition, the stockyards, but but are good..just preference rather than one being better than the other. 
The ribs were the way i like them, fairly dry with a tiny bit of stick, and very very tasty! Big and meaty. Unfortunately because we were sharing i only got 2 on a 1 lb order. Might have to just get my own order next time. 
While i am not the biggest cornbread fan, jalapenos make anything tasty. So thumbs up on this. 
The Brisket sammy was good, but i would have to say my least favourite of my three sampled items. ( I think the SY's has this one beat - sorry Hardys!). 
One thing that i think may give Hardys an edge over their neighbour is the ability to sit down and eat there. 
My first visit to Hardys (OK not quite a visit - takeout) was a success. I wish them the best of luck and keep up the tasty tasty work. You have a new fan (well i guess a first fan being that you have been open 3 days! - no bandwagon jumping here!).
Next time Ill be sure to eat in - and probably get more ribs. 
Hardys has done a great things to ""some wonderful, magical animal"" (Homer J. Simpson)"
test_711,Best breakfast in Toronto. The food at this place is outstanding. The portions are huge and everything is fresh. I love places like this where you get more than what you pay for.  LOVE THIS PLACE!
test_712,"***** 4.5 stars *****

I miss this place so much! It is the best Italian shop anywhere near Charlotte, and the only reason it's not a 5 is because it's so tiny, and thus gets REALLY busy on the weekends when everyone comes by to pick up their favorite treats. It can also be very pricey for some item, considering they're uncooked, but you definitely get the best quality meats out there.

They sell everything you can think of, from marinated cuts of all kinds of meat, about 20 different types of a la carte vegetable/side dishes, various pastries, and even homemade gelato! There is also a nice large wall section full of only Italian wines and they do weekly specials with in-store free tastings. I got some of the best steaks I've ever grilled here, and by far the best prosciutto I have ever eaten. The canolis here are also made fresh daily, and are absolutely delicious and LOADED with creme.

There's also a cute little patio area if you want to come by and have a fresh made deli sandwich, but just be warned there are only about 2 tables, so you may not get a seat. Also the hours are short most days, so if you're running late you may want to call ahead and be sure they're still open."
test_713,"Fantastic hours to choose from, fast service, friendly and no complaints!  Thank you!"
test_714,"I knew the second we got to our booth, everything was going to go downhill. The booth wasn't even clean. There was spilled water on our table, and the waitress wiped the water off with her hand. That's not sanitary at all -- why didn't they just properly clean our table? Then, she sat down to take our order as if standing to serve us was such a hassle. She started complaining about her knees, as if I cared at all. You work food service, and I know it sucks, but take our order and leave please?
The food came out -- my friend and I were sharing the food -- and she brought out a n extra plate. The first plate, she saw was dirty so she took it back and brought out another. Then she saw that it was also dirty so she took it back. Why are we being given dirty plates at all?!
We thought that if so many plates are dirty, eating the (mediocre-looking) food might be risky, so we didn't eat, got a box and paid -- and then threw it out. No tip because our waitress wasn't attentive in the slightest.
We went to chick fil a down the street. And a woman there shared her experiences with me, about how they'd give her raw bacon and it would take them a long time to get it right.
Don't go here. Really, save your money and take your family somewhere that's cleaner with better service. This place is disgusting."
test_715,"Dragon roll was amazing.  Service was average.  Vegas roll had far too much cream cheese, I felt like it was a fried cream cheese roll ."
test_716,"I just wish they would cut the grass and pick up the leaves. Other than that, it would prove to be a nice round. There should not be three inches of grass right off the green. And where they do cut, they should pick up the clippings. Expect to lose a lot of well hit balls"

If you purchase something and dont like how it tastes they will take it right back! the staff is always greetings me and making sure i find everything i need! the spinich and artichoke dip is so good you have to try it! The best part is the price; i can walk out with 2-3 big bags often costing me less than $30!!
test_718,"Great Oysters, awesome Caesar cocktail, comes with a bug lobster tail, nice environment, modern but cozy and relaxed. Service was ok, and their food is great too. I had the mussels, they were good! Nice place to go to meet new people or hang out with friends."

I think the balcony seating area is nice, it allows for really great people watching and on a nice sunny day, it's just lovely. 

Service was OK. It took us a long time to get our food and the waitress was not particularly friendly or anything, just OK. 

It was nice...but overall just an average eatery. Pricey and the food wasn't particularly amazing or anything. Nice for a lunch on the strip and people watching. 

Their candy store is much nicer than the restaurant."
test_722,"Very dark area at night! Good ice cream here, but expensive. A guy walked in while we were there and asked what the smallest size they had was and the worker said a kids scoop which still costs $3.30. The guy was a little weird too. Also some lady and her daughter tried to do cutzies in line and get in front of us and nobody said anything but we didn't let that happen anyway."
test_723,"I was pretty excited to come to Tenders and try it out!! 
We called and made reservations and we arrived at 5:40 for 5:45 reservations. We had to wait about ten minutes after arriving to a restaurant on a Saturday evening that wasn't hardly busy. The hostesses were very short and rude to us. 

Okay so we sit and are given the menus. 

The steak is outrageously expensive for the poor quality of food.  Nothing was extra ordinarily spectacular.  I was expecting a fantastic flavorful steak for $90. On top of the steak the side are a la carte at $9 for each side. We got fries, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Nothing special about the sides and the asparagus was a little to crunchy for my taste.  

The waiters were very nice, treated us respectfully and was on top of keeping our drinks full!! 
The lady that takes pictures was
Friendly and outgoing but one photo at a dinner table was $65 and she wouldn't take a photo of us with our phones even after we purchased one of her photos. 

We didn't use the bathrooms not sure they even had one or if you have to use the bathrooms in the casino like most restaurants in casinos. 
The facility was actually quite dirty, which again was surprising for the cost of the food. 

If you come here good luck, I'd much rather find a buffet to eat at over Tenders."

According to him he never received any of the voice mails I left and blamed everything on being shortstaffed.  When I called him out on his BS he had no answers and nothing even remotely like an apology was offered.  I mean why should he apologize for making me walk around in pain for weeks and not knowing why.
 BTW the only reason I finally got him on the phone was because I threatened to come down there and not leave unless I got to speak to someone."
test_726,"The bagels are okay, some are actually tasty.

The ""schmear"" (flavored cream cheese) is way too sweat for me.

The coffee is some of the worst I've ever drank.  Extremely watery, even the dark roast, tainted with stale flavors, and too expensive.

Their sandwiches are overpriced; thin toppings and not very satisfying.

And if it looks like you are walking towards UNLV, your car might get towed by the property owners (although I haven't seen this happen lately).

They like to put ""Darn Good"" on everything but I just say ""Darn""."
test_727,"I love ice cream, plain and simple! We came to this particular location because we had a coupon for a buy one get one free blizzard. When we arrived the place was not very busy, we places our order, found a seat and waited for our ice cream yumminess to  arrive. I ordered the banana split Blizzard. Yum! It was already a little melty by the time it got to me, but who cares as I dug right in! 
This location is right off the freeway, next to a hospital, it os clean and bright, and the staff is friendly. We will definitely be back for an ice cream treat, especially now since the weather is warming up!"
test_728,"-5 starts .Bad bad experience !!!! At Lincoln dealership  Ashley ""sells manager "" Terrible !!! They waist your valuable time , she never has nothing right or done , she withdrawals more money then she supposed to out of your account with out your permission,   Very poor customers service , she stuck up and rude with her thinking it's funny waisting ur time bringing you back in forth and have nothing done -.- .

Great deals ,great customer service ,you never walked out disappointed or end up giving ur car back for lack of getting  things done right the 1st time or underestimating you !!!!!!"
test_729,Love love love the cake they made for my daughter. Two tier chocolate with strawberries delicious and beautiful just like every cake I have ever bought from them. Been coming here for over 10 years and I won't be stopping any time soon
test_730,From out of town and was looking for a gym near my hotel. Marriott highly recommend Mountainside Fitness. Great friendly staff. Jarod was extremely welcoming.  really glad we came. Thank you Jarod!!!
test_731,"Garden of Lights event was beautiful in the Chinese Garden but not as exciting in the other gardens especially at night when not much is visible. The indoor exhibits and greenhouse are great though, many many displays of what each plant is and additional information!"
test_732,"If you like Mexican food, this is the place to go when in las vegas. Food and the service was awesome!!!. I ordered nachos off the appetizer menu and it was enough to feed 2 people."
test_733,Lindsey was so sweet and we absolutely loved her. The vibe is fun and the dj on Saturday makes it that much better. Definitely coming just to see her...
test_734,"My review will focus on the Arizona State Fair, as I attended many events at this large fairgrounds: Maricopa County Fair, dog shows/adoptions, concerts @ coliseum, book sale, DeafNation, so forth (all with positive experiences).  I have attended the State Fair over the years with free admission and will be reviewing mainly this year's attendance...

I went to the State Fair last Thursday on the 22nd and took advantage of their free admission between 12-1, which saved me $10 (not counting discounts offered on other days), as well as avoiding weekend crowds.  I walked around and looked at various exhibits, mingled with livestock, purchased a couple fair souvenirs (postcards, pennants, photo taken w/ fair logo over the years), and ate a typical fair snack (funnel cake).  I don't go on rides so I won't be reviewing it.  I love photography so I took quality photos all over the grounds, just a little of most of day, evening, and night ones.  There's lots to see, but I didn't expect much knowing it's Arizona.  Just do a price comparison because it's not your typical fair prices so make sure to watch your spending.  Downstairs inside the coliseum used to have various vendors either to educate or sell something; nowadays, it's just one big themed exhibition that they change annually.  This year featured Vintage Sweets sponsored by Sears, showcasing various famous candies, gums, etc.: Wrigley's, how caramel's made, as well as selling various sweets (Jelly Belly, lollies,...).  Exhibit halls featured displays & the winning ribbons: food, craft, sewing, cake decorating, photography, even collecting rocks/minerals.  Live food shows with free samples given out, as well as various like hypnotist were done periodically throughout the day.  There is one other exhibit I usually avoid: junk selling junk and especially that would be more convenient to purchase elsewhere like a mattress(!)  My favorite being an animal lover is the livestock arena where you pet / walk with zoo (baby) animals, look at small show roosters, goats, as well as sit & watch 4-H live shows.  They even added sinks for you to wash all the germs off ;)  Sheryl Crow was this year's concert lineup for that evening, so I watched her in the evening before heading home.
I appreciate that fair officials have kept in the tradition of keeping the fair going on the same grounds annually since the founding.  The fairgrounds used to be a horse racetrack until they eventually built the Veteran's Coliseum and added the fairs (state & county) and then over time included other non-related events.  That's how the fairgrounds is kept successfully in business.  The rugged southwestern 'charm' is also what keeps the price down a bit and keeps the fair looking like, well a typical fair with the livestock & food scents wafting in the air.  Relocating would kill the vintage-y history and drive prices up even more at a new location.  I never drive & park there and use only the city bus where the stops are right in front of the entrance; parking is a bit expensive and my bus fare is free so I didn't have to deal with the high price and worry about what happened to my car in some sketchy neighborhood.  The fairgrounds and some restrooms were pretty much kept clean and litter-free and when litter/spills did happened, it got cleaned up ASAP.  Remember, the grounds is a large property with so many colorful fairgoers that the hired staff could only keep up with.  I prefer using the coliseum restroom.  The air conditioning inside the coliseum was bit on the chilly side, which is not good for the body when entering from the warm outdoors.  Bringing a light sweater for this could be an inconvenient to carry around, and also an umbrella due to limit shading all over.  I usually hang around inside buildings until the sun finally set for me to mill around outside afterwards.  As for the fairgoers in general, they pretty much keep to themselves so they didn't cost trouble and being that this is typical of Arizona, alot of them looked, umm, alarmingly unkempt.  Casual dressing for fair-walking comfort doesn't mean looking like you just got out of bed under an overpass and zoomed over to the fair without eating something or brushing your hair first.  Sorry, but ick.  I know the fair doesn't have a dress code (sans nudity / barefoot) and that it's not their fault for attracting these type of people.  It's...Arizona.  I didn't choose to move to Arizona (Mom's) so it's obvious.  However, for Sheryl Crow's show, some of the people who showed up at the fair exclusively to see her and not attend the fair did look nice.  Whew, there IS hope!
Despite the fair's positive and negative history over the decades, I still think it's a nice place to attend with the special people in your lives and just GO and have a good time with positive vibes and IGNORE the bad.  There's security patroling all over.  Just have FUN and don't quibble over the little petty eews- just GO and have fun and bring home memories!"

test_736,"Face it, Starbucks is always good! .It was a little chaotic at the drink pick up which was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars."
test_737,"My mom always told me; ""if I have nothing nice to say, I should not say anything at all"". Great advise but forgive me, I don't think I will take her advise on this one.   Such a pathetic and disgusting dealership. Scummy and con-artists come to mind. My recent experiences here at Right Toyota leave a foul taste in my mouth. They will do and say anything to land a deal. Even if caught in a lie. Plus, how demeaning and condescending they will become if the deal is not going their way. We all work hard for our money, my advise would be to shop around before giving your hard earn money to these crooks."
test_738,"We have eaten here several times.  The food is outstanding and the owner is awesome.  He stopped by our table and found out we had never been there before.  We talked dishes and appetizers.  Then, he surprised us with 2 free appetizers.  He said, once you see that all the food is good, I know you'll be back.   How call is that!  Fyi-- food was and is great!"
test_739,"First of all, our waitress was adorable. She was so attentive and sweet and I just really enjoyed our experience, and she was a big part of it. Second of all, the food was great. We ordered the Baba Ganoush and two of the dinner plates along with some baklava for dessert. All the items were made with fresh ingredients and generously portioned. I also LOVED the hot sauce that came alongside the appetizer. We will certainly  be dining here again."
test_740,"Dope spot! Came across by accident but must give credit when it's due. Jae hooked me up with a nice fresh cut. Hands down, my new barber!"
test_741,"The BEST animal clinic in Cleveland! The staff is always super accommodating for last minute appointments. Dr. Matt is super friendly and loving towards my dog. He is also very honest and trustworthy. I never feel like he is ""playing"" me on costs and procedures recommended. I will continue to recommend this place for years to come!"
test_742,"If customer service is important, or if time is of the essence, abandon all hope, he who enters here. 



This place is horrendous. The first time I dealt with this place, I was looking to buy out my lease for my car. I dealt with Blake (I'm about 90% sure this was his name). He reeked of cigarettes and could not stop coughing. Watching this guy hack all over his hands and then reach out to shake my hand at the end was unnerving. He proceeded to tell me how long of a loan term I need ""oh you don't need that long.""  We didn't go with them.

Fast forward 6 months to present day.

We are looking for a loan to pay off my medical bills, redo our flooring, and some other things. We are dealing with Anthony. We were told it was a 2 week process, yesterday was the beginning of week 4. We provided the information we were told we needed, with admittedly one goof on our end (gave one wrong year of a w-2). We emailed him 4 or 5 days after the papers were turned in, and that's when we found out. After finally figuring out what was wrong, we have fixed that issue and are still waiting. We go on our trip (that we were told we would have the money for and wanted to use a little extra for fun instead of nothing but necessities), and we are home today and email him again. He then proceeds to tell us that they need official statements from the credit cards we are trying to pay off, when he assured us that just accounts numbers, amounts, addresses, and names of the companies were sufficient. Pretty sure this isn't the end of this fiasco. 

The communication is non-existent. I work for another financial institution, and know how the sales goal thing works at most banks. I'm just amazed that someone would be this slow to respond when closing a 15 thousand dollar loan. We of coursed opened a checking account 2 days after the start of the process, so they have my money already. We are honestly considering cancelling this process and going elsewhere."
test_743,"They just opened 3 days ago and I can already tell that I'll be here a lot. Authentic hand pulled noodles with thinly slides marinated beef in a savoury broth. The atmosphere is cheery with great service. 

They only have one main dish on the menu but there are a huge variety of noodle shape and sizes to choose from. I picked the medium 3 sized noodle in a large bowl which was suggested to me. 

The noodles are made fresh in front of you. It can be a bit loud so don't sit at the bar if you're concerned. I waited about 8 minutes for my bowl because they don't make the noodles ahead of time. I watched as they go straight from the guy making the noodles into the boiling pot."
test_744,"A Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant with  a great happy hour, some interesting flavour combinations, and a nice uncrowded patio. First off, where else on 17th Ave can you sit on a patio and get a 20oz. pint of beer (rotating, but we've had Wild Rose Velvet Fog and Guinness), or 6oz. pours of good red and white wine for $4?! Real fruit margaritas are $5, all of this from 3-7pm.

This isn't just a watering hole though. The sushi is very carefully prepared and presented, and at a nice price point for the quality. One fusion item we've had is the perogies and karaage chicken, an interesting twist on the ever popular chicken & waffles trend. The chicken bites were was moist, with a crispy exterior. The perogies were clearly house made, with a nice and tender lightly pan-fried dough envelope around the fluffy potato-cheese filling. The drizzled sauces were slightly spicy and sweet, and the crossover green onion accoutrement brought the two cultures together.

The tonkotsu was straight up Japanese, and while the broth was good, it wasn't the best we've had in town. The noodles were good (my wife thought they were slightly overcooked though), but the sliced pork was disappointingly lean and overcooked compared to a lot of great char siu at other ramen shops around town. While the hard cooked smoked egg was interesting to look at, I'd have preferred a soft yolk preparation, or even a jellied onsen egg.

MiraKuru: take advantage of happy hour and the patio, go for the sushi and the fusion, skip the tonkotsu unless you like hard eggs and lean pork."
test_745,"I'm so excited this place has FINALLY opened after what seemed like being forever in renovations.  It's on the same block as my office so it's a great place for a lunch spot for me and Pittsburgh really needs some good authentic ramen places.  As you walk in the ambiance has the feel or a real authentic japanese ramen place with a ramen bar and some tables to sit at.  The menu has a nice variety of different types of Japanese style ramen, as well as some appetizers like takoyaki.  I had the miso ramen which was quite tasty and flavorful and the egg was perfectly soft boiled.  The pork was delicious and tender. Most of the ramen dishes were about $10.  Unfortunately they don't have a tonkotsu ramen which is my favorite, and so far I haven't been able to find it in Pittsburgh.  The server was very attentive--almost TOO attentive as they seemed to be really trying hard to do a good job since they just opened.  I'll definitely make this a regular lunch spot!"
test_746,They came to my neighborhood and started giving away free food and I haven't been happier. I got the Mac melt it's a grilled cheese with Mac and cheese in it with tater tots. It was delicious also the guy taking our order was super rad!
test_747,"Oh wow, I read some reviews and I honestly don't agree with them at all!!
First and foremost it's terribly expensive! Every thing is √Ä la cart. I ordered a New York strip 52.00 and it was like chewing a piece of rubber @ med well and to top that off it was so salty it was at that point i couldn't-even stand to put another SALTY bite into my mouth. I asked them to remove from the table and requested a full refund for that piece rubber!! By far the WORST STEAK I'VE  EVER EXPERIENCED.!
This place was expensive people were literally sitting down and quickly leaving as soon as the sat down! Go to Ruth Chris at Harrahs!!
CV, ATLANTA"
test_748,I love Fuku Burgers! One of the best burgers in town in my opinion. Go inside and experience it I recommend it. Very chill vibe inside with a welcoming atmosphere.
test_749,"A wonderful view during the night time, and it's free!
Walking to this display, you get to experience the boulevard as well - real fun going into other casinos and observing.
The schedule is about 15-20 minutes per display, so be ready for the crowds. The street level is one of the best spots, if you get a spot near the waters. I recommend the Bellagio stairs for the view, bit of a distance on the side but a good view. Love the extra boom from the splash of the waters falling back onto the pond at the end, pretty neat.
This is definitely one of the free attractions to visit in Vegas, real beautiful sight along with the Vegas night lights. Bring a camera for some memories!"
test_750,This pizza will have your stomach full in 5 slices max! It's the best deep dish pizza you'll get outside Chicago.
test_751,"Good for the price and portions you get.  Was the lasagna awesome? No. But it was OK. Was the pizza awesome? No but it was OK. But you get a huge portion. Kinda the story with this place. Half the tables had not been bussed and it just makes the place look messy, which is not a good look for a restaurant."
test_752,"Was very please when I first walked in. Greeted right away, friendly staff. All I wanted was a simply mani nothing crazy. I read the prices and what came with each package, everything looked typical. 

I was/am not happy with how my mani turned out. For one I did not receive my ""hand massage & hot towel"" that came with my package. They seemed to rush me as soon as more people came in. It's 9:45pm right now and 3 nails have already chipped (one completely broken off), and I got my mani this afternoon.

Overall the employees are very friendly when not rushed but I wouldn't come back here. I am disappointed that I paid good money for 3 of my nails to look like this and it hasn't even been a full 24 hours."
test_753,The one thing this place has going for it is location to PNC Park. I think it just sucks in the tourists that have no idea where to get a meal or drink. Food is subpar and generally takes about 3x longer to be made than normal. Bartenders are generally overwhelmed and with that comes bad attitudes and lack of attentiveness. It's truly amazing that this place is still open.  Really nothing going for it unless you are a barely 21 yr old looking to hookup with a drunk girl who couldn't afford a ticket to a Steelers game.
test_754,Best car detail in Vegas by someone who is truly  passionate about what he does.   He detailed my black 2014 Nismo 370z and it looks better than it did when I bought it.
test_755,"We love this store! They do a great job grooming our golden retriever, Ace. They have good quality food and our puppy loves their treats. We just came in for a grooming and they gave him some treats for free which made Ace's day! Thanks for taking care of our boy!"
test_756,"I was pretty excited to fund out the Rio had a hash house a go go. I've been to the one in San Diego was and was blown away by how amazing it was. The portions were huge and the food tasted great. This one however brings shame to the hash house name. 

First off the ambiance of the restaurant is fine. A standard restaurant located in a casino at the Rio. The service here was also decent...no complaints there. The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible. By far the worst corn beef I've ever had. The biscuits looked appetizing. But again....WRONG...DRYEST BUSCUIT EVER and just not enjoyable at all. 

I still love the one in SD. But never coming back to this one. For sure."
test_757,"Every time I go in here I feel like a rock star! The atmosphere has a great vibe and Jim is totally dedicated to each and every customer! Jim and Kenny are exceptionally helpful and can answer any question you have. I personally love all the Dolce and Gabbana and Tom Ford-have purchased Prada there that still haven't seen anywhere else. He has 
an awesome collection!!! Really cool place- would never go anywhere else! Prices range from inexpensive to high end."
test_758,"the validated parking makes this location decent, I wasn't too happy coming to this location. the selection is not great what so ever, the cashiers are super slow, and this place is packed with rude customers. my preference is sobey's would be the one on spadina road instead. what selection they do have is fresh, but I think they can't keep the stock levels up with all of the condos in the area. best to avoid this location, unless you are sure that they have the items on hand. this location has a hot table\deli, and is serviced TTC wise with the 509 habourfront and 510 spadina streetcars."
test_759,"If you want to know the strength of a buffet, go during dinner because that's where they pull all their guns out. We got comped so it was a no-brainer what meal to use it on.

I'll say outside of maybe the prime rib and crab legs, it was a really an average spread. Even the dessert bar wasn't anything to get excited about. They had the usual suspects: pizza, mac n cheese, Chinese food, sushi, etc. but I had a hard time figuring out what to get because I don't like to waste my appetite of fillers like carbs. 

At $30 a pop it isn't outrageous, but it could be better. Our server also was just ok so that's adds to the experience too. Considering the ton of restaurants inside the resort, I kind of expect the buffet to step it up. MGM isn't known for their buffet and now I know why."
test_760,"--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! 

This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. 

Management provided a friendly compensation, but I don't want anyone to get poisoned, sooo yeah, eat at your own risk!!"
test_761,"Good Egg has gone ""corporate "" and they have lost me ...probably permanently.  Whenever the bean counters take over, the customer  (BTW we pay the bills!) loses. 

A less than complete list of disappointments  would include :

1.  hard to read menu
2.  most menu items are overpriced 
3. Have ro ask for ice when ordering water.
4.  butter provided with pancakes very inadequate 
5. high turnover in servers. Their longest time server, left recently.   She was the best and probably tossed her hands in the air after all the ""improvements ""
6. less than friendly environment.
7. to go cups about 50% smaller than they used to be.

Are the bean counters responsible for all this?  This surely would be the case directly  for many of the above; their ""desires "" probably has had an effect on the rest. 

Although the business deserves a 2 in my mind,  there are two mitigating things that got me to a reluctant 3.  They have remodeled the inside so it looks a lot nicer and  more contemporary. 

Saddest thing of all is that this used to be one of my favorite restaurants.   Gave them high marks on Yelp and used to direct and/or take people here.   No mo!

There are many far better places near here.  Check them out."
test_762,"We ate here the other night. There was no wait at 6:30 and we sat right away. Our server was very nice and did a great job, the food just was not very good.

The spinach dip appetizer was not what we expected. The menu said tortilla chips, but the chips were almost like fried pita bread or they use flour instead of corn tortillas. The chips were chewy and greasy. We almost wanted to ask the manager to come out and try some of the dish and see what he would say. 

The fried fish plate was big, but somewhat on the salty side. The breading on the shrimp and oysters overpowered the flavor and texture of the seafood. 

We were disappointed with the food and will not return."
test_763,"My fianc√© and I always sit at the bar, so never had service problems. Delicious pizza and spaghetti and meatballs! Their dessert pizza is delicious too! 

But...the best part is the triple filtered NYC-style water!:) Especially in the desert ;-)"
test_764,"Jeff and personnel have almost always been very thorough and helpful when servicing, inspecting or putting tires on any of my vehicles. They have even matched prices from competitors for me if I was aware of a better deal on tires elsewhere. They also do or suggest you do only the services that you truly need, not the ones that are sometimes insisted upon by other centers that just want to make an extra buck. Also, they can fit you in often times when you REALLY need the work done. Only complaint I have ever had is if they are busy they may not give you suggestions on all the tires that are currently available, but if you do your homework online they can better assist you. Coupons are readily available on the website, helpful and make their prices pretty reasonable too."
test_765,"Over the past 2 years I've been at this restaurant about 5 times and each time I say ""never again.""
Every time we go it's horrible service and lack luster quality of sushi. Tonight I felt like I was at a playground while trying to eat. There was a party of 10 there with 4 kids that literally ran laps around the place the whole hour we were there. I wish I was making this up. How do the parents just turn a blind eye like they own the place? So rude. And nobody said anything to them either. 
Granted, the server did apologize to us about his lack of service while giving us the check.
After tonight's debacle, I wont be spending anymore money there."
test_766,"The only reason I'm giving this location three stars instead of the usual 5 is because the outside table area was coated in dried ice cream from what it appeared to be quite awhile. 

The two employees handled the crowd in the store very well and my ice cream tasted as delicious as I'd expect from Coldstone. I'll more than likely return, but will more than likely deter any suggestions to eat outside."
test_767,"Went to eat before a concert today. The food was good but the worst service I have had for a while. The waitress took extended periods of time to come to us and forgot many things we asked for (like a lemon or refill of a pop). They tried to double charge us for a drink. My food came out 15 minutes later than my friends. No apologies or anything said about the long waits or poor service. The restaurant did not seem overly busy. It took over 30 minutes to get a box and pay our bill. Just disappointed with the service today will not be back here to eat again.

Update: attempted to private message with no response"
test_768,"Went here for a pre-valentine's day dinner on Friday the 13th. 4-course menu for $85 per person. 

The restaurant crammed as many 2-tops as possible very close to one another violating any possible privacy. 

Service was nothing but transactional, think diner style. We felt rushed towards the end. With two dinners, a few glasses of wine, and a 20% tip the bill was north of $270 for a couple, and based on the quality of food (not bad, but nothing to write home about), mediocre service, I don't think this place is worth ever going back to."
test_769,"This is a fantastic experience with a variety of options incase you have a variety of picky eaters in the group.

Wonderful selection of super fun and different twists on traditional cuisine. We went for brunch and I had the cornbread pancake with spicy fried chicken and it was fantastic. The kids had traditional buttermilk pancakes and they all seemed pleased.  My best friend had the adobo nachos and was over impressed.

A solid decision for reasonable prices"
test_770,"Pretty decent and fast. The chow mein is unique, but a must-try at least once. Live a little!"
test_771,"There isn't much that I can said that hasn't been said already, but here it goes, anyway.
Years ago, when I was first being introduced to Cleveland, it was Happy Dog that made me fall in love with the city. Well, Happy Dog and West Side Market, but for similar reasons. It doesn't matter who you are, what you look like, how much money you make, or where you're from - Happy Dog is the place to be. Sure, it's ""hipstery,"" but not in an exclusive sort of way. On any given day, you'll see the stereotypical ""hipster,"" but you'll also see a couple people in suits, some people who looks like your grandparents, a lot of normcore people, and the occasional rough & tumbley group. Everyone loves a wiener, and Happy Dog loves everyone.
Just...just go. Don't wait. Go now. Happy Dog is love. Happy Dog is life."
test_772,Best Indian food in the valley. The food quality is just awesome and at the same time equally good service.
test_773,"As a first time costumer, I was very impressed with the service, quality and turnaround time for the shirts.  They have different quality shirt types for all budgets.  I would also add they are affordable for one or more shirts."
test_774,"Alaskan king crab. AMAZING. also their mediteranian/mid east food was quite good.

The wait to get in was a bit long, but manageable."
test_775,"Get the kimchi pork belly fried rice and tempura chicken with deviled eggs!!! I'm not big on deviled eggs but I could've eaten a dozen of these. Easily. They had a nice, surprising crunch and great flavor. The chicken and rice were also super flavorful and the portions were enough for two people to share. 

They lose a star for the too-loud music (hate when I have to scream during my meal) and the unfriendly bartender that rudely seated us from the bar. It would've been nice to have someone welcome us at the door and personally seat us. Not the bartender mumble under her breath from the other end of the bar...even a smile or walking over to where we stood would've been enough. Anyway, our server made up for this sour first impression and was warm."
test_776,"Terrible service and an overpriced menu.  You have 15 people behind the counter, no one in front of me, but 20 minutes for my order.  Terribly run place."
test_777,"I was able to book an appointment for an updo for my wedding at Mandalay Bay fairly easily a few days before. I was a guest at Mandalay Bay, so this salon was a super convenient option. I arrived first thing on a Saturday, and I believe my stylist was named Anya. She chastised me over and over for washing my hair that morning since I have very soft hair which made the updo difficult to stick. 

Overall, the price was reasonable ($125) for the style I received. I was satisfied with how it looked and felt. The 3/5 rating is for the snide comments that the stylist made, and the comfort of the salon: the robes were too small for me, and I was too tall for the chair, so I had to position myself uncomfortably."
test_778,"Went to the Depeche Mode concert here on Saturday and besides the great concert we came away impressed with the facility.
The T-Mobile arena is a huge facility, seating 20000+ but like many modern stadiums and arenas the seating is terraced in such a way that even the upper seats have a relatively good view.

The personnel here were very friendly and helpful. We were fortunate to have a VIP box and suite and the seats, amenities and views were fantastic. As we walked around before the concert we also saw that other seats throughout the venue also had good views.
The sound was loud and clear and the lighting was also super.

Security entering and exiting the arena was excellent. As others have mentioned Uber is a good option here as there are more people than taxis.
Our first concert here but would certainly return again"
test_779,"Burrito Boyz is a city staple! Local or Tourist, these guys were one of first to bring the burrito style meals to Toronto in a real meaningful way. The experience of dining at a BB is the same as it has always been. Loud, a bit confusing, and always delicious. Portions are a good size and quality is top notch. Personally the Halibut is still my favourite, but everything is pretty much awesome.

My fav. locations are Adelaide or College st, but they're pretty all the same. They recently added a counter only location on Dundas East right near the Eatons Centre. On a warm day I order there and eat over at the Ryerson Fountain area... great for people watching.

All in... the food is good, the price is right, and it's a damn tasty burrito."
test_780,I've been to this location several times is always give me quick friendly service. Thank you post net
test_781,"I love this place, it's a great place if you're hungry, want to stuff yourself, and love seafood. It's great value if you take advantage of the AYCE aspect.

It's a buffet at the Rio so it's not the same quality as fine dining but the mini lobster tails are easy to get out of the spines and plentiful. There are crab legs, prime rib, and other buffet type items that can be found at the main buffet which is also phenomenal."
test_782,"Myself and my boyfriend have been coming to this location for 4 years. In some cases 3 times a day. Now we love to cook for ourselves. And we enjoy our home very much. We come here for the food, and the service. 

Its a funny thing, service. In order to recieve good or great service all you need, is to be friendly and positive and not a snobby asshole. Neat concept, right?

The staff here knows us pretty well by now, especially management, and we have our favorite waitresses, Karin, Crystola that always treat us like family and enjoy a conversation with us. 

We've ventured into here at all times of the day and night. I think the only time I had a bit of a complaint was when my iced coffee was more like coffee water. But no big deal. They remade it and apologized.

Whenever we're in the mood for a light hearted environment and a well cooked casual meal, we venture to this Dennys. And trust me, Ive had some really bad experiences at other locations. 

If you do come here, Id say you need to ask for Crystola or Karin. Karin if youre looking for a chuckle or two, she'll tell you some stories that will make you laugh, and her old world accent just adds to the charm. 

Crystola doesnt beat around the bush and will get you what you want and need when you ask for it. Shes not much of a talker but thats because shes working. :)

For as long as we will be in Arizona, this will always be our go to spot for coffee and a warm meal. 

We have had their hot/cold coffee. Just about everything on the breakfast menu and lunch menu, but we havent really tried anything on the dinner side. Their burgers are always cooked perfectly, and their breakfast reminds me of my childhood on Saturday mornings."
test_783,"I have been wanting to get to the aquarium since it opened, so today being my twin grandchildren's first birthday, was the perfect excuse.  I went with an open mind.  Because we went on a weekday morning, we had the place to ourselves.  Of course the one year olds weren't as interested as the adults in the party, but still, was nice to let them get out of their strollers and get up close and personal with the exhibits.

I love the building and the way they kept the integrity of the brickwork and architecture so think the flow is creative and unique, going from exhibit to exhibit.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  It was so nice that there was someone in every room to answer our questions and educate us on the exhibits.  This is a major plus.  

I would definitely return and there was some construction going on so looks to be more exhibits coming.  It is small, but well done.  I think small children would love seeing the jellyfish above them and walking through the shark tube."
test_784,Excellent brunch with always new things on the menu.  Fried chicken is one of Toronto's best for dinner.
test_785,I recently ordered a plant for Mother's Day through this florist.  My mom absolutely loved it.  She texted a picture of it to me and it was beautiful.  I had originally ordered a different plant online but received a phone call from the florist to let me know they were out of that particular plant but she gave me options to choose as a replacement.  She was very helpful and friendly.  I am very happy with my purchase and am happy to recommend them to others.
test_786,Got sat immediately for Sunday lunch. Service was good. Buffet has lots of options. Dumplings and Lo mein was good. Good seemed fresh.
test_787,"On m'avait parl√© du caf√©-coop√©rative de solidarit√©-ami des artistes, et il fallait que j'aille y faire un tour, question de prospecter les possibilit√©s d'y accrocher. Le premier d√©tour fut int√©ressant. Le Caf√© l'Art√®re est situ√© sur une fronti√®re, qui passe notamment entre le crade et le branch√©, entre le Mile-End (ou m√™me le Mile-Ex pour les connaisseurs) et Parc-Ex, et entre le caf√© √©tudiant et l'√©norme espace d'accrochage-spectacle d'une salle-gallerie de quartier d√©saffect√© ou en d√©veloppement.

Il est situ√© √† l'int√©rieur de l'une des tours √† bureau bordant l'avenue du Parc jouxtant la rue Jean-Talon, un environnement industriel vaguement hostile o√π l'on ne se retrouve pas par hasard. Quoiqu'il en soit, le caf√© vaut le d√©tour, pas loin du m√©tro Parc, les petites rues autour regorgeant d'espaces de stationnement; il n'y a pas d'excuse pour ne pas s'y rendre. 

La raison principale devrait √™tre de profiter de l'espace tr√®s grand, dans une ambiance d√©contracte qui rappelle le caf√© D√©panneur du quartier Mile-End, ou l'Escalier du quartier Ville-Marie. Sauf qu'ici, la formule est l√©g√®rement diff√©rente. Aussi ancr√©e dans la communaut√© mais davantage orient√© vers la communaut√© artistique, l'√©quipe de d√©vou√©s tirant les leviers le fait en mode coop√©ratif ""¬†auto-gestion¬†"", formule qui fait penser √† la coop√©rative Touski du quartier Centre-Sud. S'y d√©roulent des 5 √† 7, des conf√©rences et des spectacles, sans compter des ateliers et vernissages. L'Art√®re est l'ami d'un peu tout le monde, si bien qu'on se demande s'il a vraiment une direction pr√©cise ou un esprit de communaut√©; les f√©ministes, les anarchistes, les √©cologistes, les LGBT, les v√©g√©tariens et v√©g√©taliens, et bien-entendu, les artistes au sens large.

Parlant des adeptes du v√©g√©tarisme, le caf√© sert de la nourriture. J'ai bien lu quelque part le ""¬†Caf√©-restaurant v√©g√©tarien et v√©g√©talien l'Art√®re¬†"", mais lors de ma visite, le menu affichait √©galement des plats comprenant de la viande. On y sert des bi√®res locales et de micro-brasserie, accessibles si on consomme de la nourriture. 

Au sortir de mon exp√©rience, je me sens toutefois un peu critique. Mon cappuccino au go√ªt impec √©tait cependant √©trangement petit, si petit que je croyait boire un espresso (la vache a manqu√© de lait?), tant en est-il que mon t√©l√©phone portable ne contient pas assez de pixels pour vous le pr√©senter. Le service √©tait un peu lent, un seul serveur √† l'attention du grand local au trois-quart plein. Il y avait enfin une connexion Internet ""¬†√éle-sans-fils¬†"" performante, mais pas suffisamment de prises de courant pour brancher mon ordinateur portable. Moins d'√©toiles, donc, mais je suis tent√© d'y revenir assister √† l'une des activit√©s et √©ventuellement r√©viser cette √©valuation. 

Car il ne s'agit pas d'un caf√© comme les autres, avec sa formule coop√©rative qui sort de l'ordinaire. Il faut donner l'opportunit√© √† cette ""auto-gestion"" encore jeune d'apprendre et de faire la preuve que cette formule fonctionne. Pour l'instant, l'ensemble du service et de l'endroit m√©riterait √† mon avis un peu plus de clart√©. Et surtout la mission communautaire, elle, le m√©rite d'autant plus. √Ä noter que l'espace dispose, tel un caf√© √©tudiant, d'un vieux piano, d'un espace de livres √† bouquiner et de quelques jeux. Un plus!

Point boni¬†: le caf√© est situ√© √† m√™me le local d'une petite boutique √©cologiste faisant office d'√©co-quartier. La boutique est un beau capharna√ºm d'articles tous aussi int√©ressants les uns que les autres sur le th√®me de la d√©fense de l'environnement, et inclut une s√©lection de livres des √âditions √âcosoci√©t√©."
test_788,"Easy place to find, we had a Living Social deal and went to use it last night.  Clean inside, don't let the depressing-looking strip mall setting deter you, because the food is GREAT.  We ordered the sub sandwiches to go, a Turkey and a BLT and they were delicious and worth the drive. We'll be back again.  Well-lit, clean inside, service was prompt and the food was amazing."
test_789,"By far the worst manicure pedicure I have ever received. They rough, rude and provide low grade services. I actually need to file my nails to be even and my gel manicure was globbed on. Better luck doing your own nails."
test_790,"Food is great but no sauce for the meat, I don't know what's the right way to eat it but every time I order uber eats for this type of food I expected the sauce to come with it. It's OK if it's extra charge but plz put into the sides option with all the combo. When I see the menu I thought that's like extra sauce so I didn't buy it."
test_791,Amazing service & skills based on years of reliable service. My job was done without any difficulties. Great price! Make sure your garage door repairs are done by a licensed technician who stands behind his work... This service is the ONE... In a field dominated by fly by night artists Upright foes it right!
test_792,"I've heard the sound system is supposed to be great here but It sounds really bad. Here to see Justin Timberlake April 15 2018 sitting in sec 224 and there are no highs, just muffled mids and base. Can also hear the speakers popping regularly. What gives, did JT blow out the system last night?  So that was the warm up dj and band. Once JT came out and the system was cranked to 11 it just became an unintelligible mess. What a disappointment."
test_793,"Been here several times, no purchases. They have a small collection to browse, I get the feeling mostly catalog order."
test_794,"Very mixed experience with the service at this store. I originally purchased my phone at this store about a year ago and recently had it damaged beyond repair in an accident. I was at the store today to set up the new phone. The intake person greeted me and was fine. I was the only person there waiting for assistance. But the technician  behind the desk refused to acknowledge me. When another customer behind me walked in, she walked past me to have a prolonged conversation with that person while ignoring me. It was a very odd experience because she seemed to want me to know she was ignoring me.The intake person was nowhere to be found. After a long wait, I was about to walk out when the other technician became available to help. She was very helpful, professional and pleasant to work with. But I would be hesitant to buy another phone from here given the overall experience."
test_795,"There was an extensive variety of baked goods wrapped in plastic wrap sitting on tables, but there was not way to tell how fresh they were.  We opted for sharing a flan from the dessert case.  It was neither light nor tasty."
test_796,"Came here for lunch, when we first arrived it was somewhat busy but quickly emptied out. The waitress was good at first but once we ordered, never saw her again. It took an hour to get sliders (?!) unacceptable service. The only good thing is sitting outside and people watching. After we got our food, we had to track down our waitress for a refill on our drinks."
test_797,"If you want a great, gourmet cupcake go to the Cake Artists Studio on Bloomington Road. They are cheaper and she's an accomplished pastry chef. The cupcakes at Cakes are overpriced and not special at all."
test_798,"Cool atmosphere, the place is huge, they have a mechanical bull. The complimentary bread is delicious. I decided to try the French Dip sandwich (never have, ever) not a fan. (Horseradish is gross) I think you need to go with a burger or big plate to be satisfied with ur meal. Ok service, anytime I go to a restaurant I hate hunting waiter down for refills. I didn't want to rate based on my bad choice of meal, bcuz everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal."
test_799,"The food was Terrible, everything seemed frozen and reheated in a microwave. I went for brunch so I tasted their breakfast it was disgusting and their lunch was the same. Not too much to choose from and what they have is not worth it not even the desserts were good. Don't waste your money here go to the one in Cesar palace is more expensive but it's so worth it you won't be sorry. This ones just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth"
test_800,"We were at the Meatball Joint and then the rooftop bar. It is a great place with good food, drinks and atmosphere. The only reason we couldn't give it 5 stars is for the service at the Meatball Joint. It was some of the worst service I've had. First, the hostess barely acknowledged us when we walked in (she was busy looking at her phone or something) and after about a full minute or so, she looked up and said ""yes?"" We asked for a table for 5 and she checked the table set up (there were plenty of open seats) and then had a small conversation with a waitress about the table set up. She picked up some menus and walked over to a table already set for 5. Once she put the menus down, she turned to us and impatiently said ""you can sit here."" All through the night you could see her acting bored, ignoring customers, etc. Our waitress was no better. Very inattentive, and when we first sat down, gave us no time to order drinks and was impatient while we tried to determine. As she filled up our water glasses, she asked if it was our first time there. When we said ""yes"", her response was ""oh"" and then walked away. I think we saw her about 4 times over the course of our meal. We also asked her to change one the TVs to ABC and it was never changed and she appeared confused when we told her the channel with the specific game on it. The final thing was when we asked for the checks and told her specifically how to separate them, she came back with them messed up. So if you're okay with terrible service but great food - stop on in. I think we'll be back even with the horrible service."
test_801,"Ok, so there is another teharu in Scottsdale and it is AMAZING. Literally one of my favorite places to get cheap sushi that's still delicious. So when I heard they were opening one closer to my house I was like ""score! This is gonna be great"" but, sadly, it was not. I've gone here three times at three different times of day and each time the sushi was lukewarm and the wait staff was rude. I get that you take your chances with conveyer belt sushi and sometimes a roll just isn't gonna be great because they're not busy and it's been sitting out for a while. It's a risk I'm willing to take, but at the other teharu if you ask them to make you a fresh roll they happily oblige whereas at the one at superstition springs, if you ask them for a fresh order of anything (or even for a refill!) they act like its the biggest inconvenience in the world. 

On top of that, the people who work there are just straight up rude. They usually take a while to pick up the check, which is annoying but not a huge problem, except for last night when I was there with my sister and brother who has special needs. My brother got sick halfway through our meal so my sister took him out to the car and gave me her card to pay for her food. So I'm sitting there, waiving at the waitress constantly and she ignores me for about five minutes before coming over and simply responding with ""what?"" I ask her for the checks and she goes to get them. When she comes back with the checks, she hands them to me and asks ""so are they coming back or what?"" And I told her ""no, my brother just got sick so they're waiting for me in the car. I have the debit cards right here though."" Then I go to hand her the checks back and she walks away! I watch her go up to the front and pull out her phone so I go up there and I was like ""my brother is really not feeling well so can I get these checks taken care of?"" To which she responded ""I just gave them to you. Why are you being so impatient??"" That's when I just about lost it on her :) 

So...safe to say I will not be going back. I'll stick to ahi in Gilbert or make the drive to teharu Scottsdale. It's worth it."
test_802,We love this place!! You have to try their bacon fried rice! It's one of a kind! We have ordered several entrees and all have been delicious! We especially love the Pad Thai. The place is clean and the staff is always friendly. A hidden gem in Ahwatukee for sure.
test_803,"Fabulous service and awesome food.

We had the Italian wedding soup, the fried sampler plate, and the carbonera."
test_804,"AMAZING!

I didn't realize I was doing waxing all wrong until I went here. I used to get so worked up before waxing because I knew how painful it was going to be. But I was pleasantly surprised when I went to The Ten Spot and realized the pain was almost nonexistent. Raquel and I chatted about the different types of waxes and why some waxes are better for this and that. I wish I learned all this years ago! 

Extra bonuses include: cleanliness seems extremely important to all employees, staff is friendly, you get to watch That 70s Show during your wax!"
test_805,"So... arrived at ~5:30 and sat outside... ordered by 5:35... then we waited... and waited... and waited. No one checked on us (2 people) until 6:15. At that point, we asked for our food to go. Got that and the checks at 6:20. Finally able to pay and leave by 6:30.
Probably some of  the worst service I have received. At least if you are running behind or food is taking awhile, you come back and explain and/or apologize. Instead, we were left wondering and waiting for our food. Obviously that never came until we said we were going to leave and take it with us. You would think at that point they would have apologized or taken something off the check, but no, nothing.
Chances are, I won't be back. That is unfortunate, as we spend a lot of time in the area and this would have been a great outdoor spot!
To top it off, when I got home and opened the soggy boxes, I was very disappointed at what I paid $11 for."
test_806,"This is a review of Pet Shop's policy, not of anything else. I buy rats to feed my snakes but I am a regular customer of Predators in mesa. Predators will accept a return on rats that are not eaten but the Pet Shop won't. I will return to Predators for all of my future business bc sometimes ball pythons don't eat and the rats need to be returned.

Five stars bc they rock at everything else."
test_807,"Way over priced for what the quality they offer. Whole Foods is so much better for so many reasons. To make it worse, with the exception of the cashiers, the employees are not friendly. Dismal customer service. The store was pretty empty during the middle of the day on a Saturday. It is easy to see why"
test_808,"This has been my go-to barbershop for a year now. I used to go to Crow's Nest but got fed up with having to book a haircut a month in advance. Friendly staff, great tunes, reasonable price and wait time, and good hair cuts."
test_809,"I really miss this place. I had hoped that reading reviews of it on Yelp would allow me to experience again, if only in my mind, how delicious this (bad for you) food is. It's worth the hype. Haven't found anything like it anywhere since."
test_810,"I came here because my friend recommended this place. I ordered the mango boba slushee, and definitely no complaints there. I can see them really trying hard and going the extra mile to make their boba stand out from all the neighboring boba stores. I guess I can't give it 5 stars even though I really wanted to because they have a lot of logistical issues. They gave my first drink order to someone else, not a big issue because they remade it very quickly, but this issue could definitely have been avoided. It's a bit on the pricier side of things, especially for boba, but at the same time, you do get a little bit more extra stuff."
test_811,Finally found a place to actually be able to shape my nail nicely and they last until my next visit.
test_812,"I made a reservation and took my Mom here for her birthday. The host called me the day of to confirm my reservation and asked for the name of the person celebrating their birthday. 

Exceptional Items:
-When we arrived they sat us and gave us menus with my Mom's name, and ""Happy Birthday"", along with the date. It was a simple but very nice touch that she loved and made her feel special.
-They took our picture, printed it, and put it in a birthday card they made card for her to take
-I ordered the Cajun Steak; it was one of the best steaks I've had at a steak house! Perfectly seasoned and at the perfect temperature. My mom had the porterhouse steak and loved her steak as well. 
- Very extensive wine list! 
-The service we received from our server was great. She was very nice and knowledge of the menu

Average Items:
-The brussel sprouts were ok, nothing special
-The lobster mac was ok, the lobster was chewy
Creme Brulee for dessert was good, but it's hard to make creme brulee anything more than what it is.
-Crab cakes ok, served with a sauce that tasted like flavored mayo
-Lobster bisque, ok

I would definitely recommend eating here and will be back."
test_813,"I am giving Peppermint Cafe 5 stars because it has been a very pleasant experience every time I have been there.  THe quality of the food is great, very fresh, but most importantly the service is and always has been professional and pleasant.

This restaurant knows that a properly trained serving staff can make or break a restaurant...add that to the quality of the food, and that equals success!  No matter how crowded they are, we can get in and out in 30 to 40 minutes.

The location is in Pepper Pike, in the Landerwood Plaza (near Heinens), tucked next to a hardware store.  The owners have done a very nice job with the interior, for me it is a calming decor."
test_814,"This is still the only place I take my dog. My boyfriend took notice how much I rave about them that we took his dog to get his nails trimmed. It was his first time and we were all nervous. But once again, Mike and the staff took such great care and kept his dog calm. 
I haven't taken my dog to any other place but here since my friend recommended it."
test_815,"This is my go to restaurant. The staff here is really nice and every time I have a special request with my order they are always willing to comply. Not one negative thing to say about this place. Great customer service, great food, and an all around great atmosphere."
test_816,"I had a car stereo installed about four months ago, and I couldn't be happier with the job they did.  The price is very reasonable; it actually was less than they initially quoted me because they ended up not needing one of the parts.  I know next to nothing about car stereos and I wouldn't have known the difference, but they were honest and took the part off my bill.  The staff are great people and they were very understanding when my schedule changed that day and messed up my pick-up and drop-off times.  The service was professional and fast, and I've been very pleased with the job they did.  Highly recommended!"
test_817,"Soooooo...as I've mentioned in previous reviews, I love Mexican food. I had been talking about this place for over a month and my boyfriend surprised me by bringing me here on a date. We both left agreeing that we will never come back again. 

We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly. She brought chips and salsa and our waters. When it came time to order, I was disappointed that there was no a la carte options. None of the dinner combinations had what I wanted but I was told that I could not add a single empanda, even for a cost. I was disappointed but willing to keep an open mind. 

We ordered mimosas and I would tell you about them, but they never came. The manager and waitress apologized several times. We said it was cool as long as we weren't charged for them.

Now to the food. The chips and salsa were actually really good. Our meals arrived and I had ordered the #12- half quesadilla, enchilada and taco. My boyfriend had the #11- two empanadas, two stuffed jalape√±os, and two tacos. We both were not impressed. The beef on my taco was room temperature. The enchilada had been laid on top of the beans so it was soggy. The quesadilla was something I could easily make at home. My boyfriend liked the stuffed jalape√±os. He said his tacos were just okay and the dough of the empanada was not good. It tasted kinda like a funnel cake and was very greasy. Also, he ordered a pork taco and there were huge chunks of fat. In fact, we thought maybe it was a piece of shrimp but no - pure fat. I also thought the rice and beans were bland and left 95% of them on the plate. 

I wanted to love this place. The location is great (although parking can be rough) and I had high hopes. But it was terrible. In fact, I would be surprised if this place stays in business. I don't mean that to be hateful but it is my honest opinion. Based on my experience and the other reviews, this place seems to be consistently bad. 

If you are reading this and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go to Maverick Rock Taco or Three Amigos instead (see my other reviews). 

Bottom line: underwhelmed in every way."
test_818,This was my first time here. I had a career asada burrito and a small diet drink. It was good and fresh and tasty. Good choice of salsa and sauces. Worth coming back again soon!
test_819,"7 of us had a business lunch at the Mixx on 12/14/17. There was almost nobody there when we walked in. We ordered appetizers. I reached for my plate and noticed it was dirty - it had melted cheese on top of it. I gave it back to the server and while she was standing right next to me, I reached for another plate. This one had chewing gum stuck to it. I was pretty much done - are you kidding me??
We ordered fish and chips but there was only enough fish for 2 people. Then they ran out of fish. I ordered mushroom risotto but was told that they were out of it. It was 12:30pm! Who stocks your kitchen? Two of my co-workers ordered the same pasta meal. One meal had mushrooms in it, the other one did not. No consistency. Needless to say, we will NOT be back."
test_820,"These guys are my heroes!  They literary saved the paint on my car.  The car was covered with salt, sand, and road grime from a cross country transport trip. Plus my car is black on black and extremely prone to scratches. The detailers were extremely professional and quick, and I was in love with the final product.  I will be a regular customer and recommend them to all of my friends."
test_821,"Horrible. Avoid at all cost. Cold cheese on a Philly cheese steak!?!?They did not allow the cheese to melt all the way through. 

The bacon cheese fries were cold to the touch. 

The fried pickles tasted like old oil."
test_822,Excellent experience.  Totally would recommend this place.  It was a first for us and I would do it again.
test_823,good spot in city north which is a dead zone for businesses. They do a good happy hour with food and drink specials. Has a decent beer selection and a fun outgoing crowd. Lots of nice looking ladies. Keep up the good work Julian.
test_824,"A great Phoenician restaurant. Pretty simple: fried fare and alcohol. If you want quinoa, a spritzer, or some light fare at ridiculous prices while hanging with your Club of Dandies- this ain't for you."
test_825,"Lack of staff made the line so long that I decided to set my items down and leave- not before I mentioned to the cashier to tell the manager why their loosing customers.  
In addition, every item I wanted I can find cheaper at other stores.
Glad I didn't waste my money or time standing in line. 
Two stars only because they do have a large selection of items in each department, however it's all overpriced. Also because it's in a good area with lots of parking. 
I won't return."
test_826,"Simple yet effective formula. Take quality sea food. Boil it and put it in a bag with tasty sauce. Serve.  In the bag still.

I admit I was skeptical at first. But I managed to get through a lunch of cajun mussels without splashing sauce on my suit. 

The flavours were explosive and delightful. Great esthetic and service. Will come again."
test_827,"I guess my new Droid X can't do everything; I was trying to find the location of the Koi Restaurant and spoke the words Koi Sushi and it started giving me Coy places. If it were an interactive device, I would've told it to not be coy with me.

In addition to the smart phone debate, the place doesn't have a website, in which I wish it did. I was trying to get my Sushi-Loving-But-Worried friend to warm up to a new place she hadn't been to before. So, without the site and not necessarily relying on other reviewer's opinions, I stopped by there just to get brochures, pamphlets, menus and health inspection notifications. Luckily, the latter had all fifteen of them marked: Now Meets Substandard Quality.

Okay, that last part was a joke, but I did get the very colorful menu and convinced her to broaden her palate. We did go, in fact, and it was DELICIOUS! I do love Sushi, but unfortunately, I don't get to go to the high end places, so mine's limited to good-to-buffet style. I write that so you know where my experience comes from. (I also liked Todai, but I don't believe it's here in AZ anymore.)

We both got the all-you-can-eat, which is, in fact, limited to what you can eat. Any leftovers and they're supposed to charge you. My father always told me my eyes got bigger than my stomach, and they did here. I thought we ordered 6 items altogether, and each items include what, 6-8 pieces each?

Turns out we only ordered 4, and half way through we told our excellent waitress that if we had ordered any more: CANCEL! She confirmed this was all we asked for. Between me and my friend, we couldn't even finish all four. I wish I remembered what ""states"" (meaning types of Sushi) we ordered, but I do remember the last: The Rhode Island. That was HOT, but enormously delicious. Too bad I could only eat two pieces before I was spent.

Here's great customer service: It was our first time there, and I knew we ordered more than we could eat, so I was prepared to pay the piper. Our waitress left us and came back after speaking with someone else and told us that we didn't have to pay full price because overall we didn't order much. Thank goodness! With tip and all, it came to roughly $80 - out of my own pocket. And we didn't even get the Sake Bombers I so wanted.

Advice: Unless you're a heavy eater, which I am not, order just individual items. It could save you a bunch from the All-You-Can-Put-Away prices.

Overall, the place is clean, quaint, really beautiful inside - small enough for intimacy and a great and helpful staff. Honestly, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the place and would recommend to all.  I would say they need to learn about an up'n'coming new international media device most people have on their laptops, but other than that, enjoy!"
test_828,"The first time we came here service was OK and all the meals arrived at the same time, however since then service has gone downhill. The last time we were there it was the last straw, 5 of us sat down for breakfast. I asked for a glass of water and am still waiting for it. All the meals arrived except mine, and when it finally arrived The eggs Benny was stone cold so I sent it back. 

If you all get bacon and eggs all is fine but try ordering a crepe, eggs Benny, an omelet and a smoothie and everything seems to fall apart.

After 3 consecutive bad service experiences we have taken our breakfast business elsewhere"
test_829,"Let me start by saying that I grew up going to another Red Devil location in Phoenix, so I am a little bias. I love the food here, although I think I've only gotten the pizza, salad and wings my entire life! There's a lovely Russian waitress there who is a real sweetheart and who makes the whole dining experience so much better. My one qualm is that not much effort is taken to spruce up the place - it looks like it came from a time capsule buried in 1990. 

$3 Long Island Iced Teas, and a $20.99 special on a large cheese pizza with 20 wings....awesome. Throw in some antipasto, and you have yourselves a party!"
test_830,"quinn is back and he is the man! he provides the best customer service and will go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. they have the best selection and prices in the valley!  all there fish are excellent and coral are very nice. i will never go to another salt water fish store again
this place is the best and they dont try and get over on you. they make sure when you leave you are leaving happy!"
test_831,Such a disappointment! No soap or shampoo and asking for an extra pillow is a hassle. The pet fee is 50$ which is a joke. No cable no pool and if you want clean sheets you have to bring your dirty ones to the desk. I will never stay here again. Don't waste your time.
test_832,"I love this coffee shop! They have excellent service and they have delicious coffee! They also have a fantastic almond latte! I have tried any of their baked goods but they look delish! This coffee shop is also environmentally friendly! Their coffee lids are made from cornstarch and plastic ware is made from potato starch, they dissolve in compost in so many days...So this coffee shop is a must stop for the neighborhood!"
test_833,"I have been a member for close to two years. I first joined it was clean and motivating For the past month there has been no towels to use 80 % of the time. I am lucky if the dispenser with wet wipes are full. I would say it's full 50 % of the time that is the best of my awful review. Almost every bench and a good portion of the machines have cracks in the leather and I mean huge long cracks, full of bacteria. I inquired about this 2 weeks ago, it is obvious that they refuse to fix them. It is definitely  a health hazard. They have not had free WiFi for at least a month which cost me money!!! The place is downright filthy!!!! The turnover in staff is constant and I have noticed there are 10 guys working out and one female which has to tell you something. The ratio of men and woman are terrible. A year ago they had double the staff at all times working the floor, very friendly, there were 5 people getting trained by pro trainers at any given time, now maybe 1 while I am there. This place needs to figure this thing out. I am looking for a new gym and at this point I will probably go back to snap due to convenience. I will pay more money with old equitment and one standing tanning bed to get out of this place before I get really sick. I am giving it 2 more weeks if some changes are not made I will leave. I have a ton of insight in this business. I will say so does the owner because it was a great place to go for a long time there are some very quick and easy and inexpensive tweaks that would get your memberships back to where they were. I hope somebody takes some action so we can enjoy this neighborhood gym once again! BTW I do not complain, but I spend a lot of time there much more before undergoing open heart surgery 5 months ago. Take care and let me know if there is anything  I can do!! Thanks for listening!!
 Best regards"
test_834,"Had a great brunch here!!! The blah blah blah breakfast is fantastic. It comes with eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast. Strongly recommend this."
test_835,I ordered a cake batter shake here because it was recommend by a friend. It took them 10 minutes to tell me they were out of cake batter. I asked them for a Carmel frappe instead. It took them several attempts to make and about 30 minutes of my time. They finally just gave up and made a vanilla shake and added a lot of Carmel. Horrible customer service and the biggest waste of time just for ice cream. Very dissatisfied.
test_836,"These guys are awesome!  We were traveling through Champaign in our rv and a warning light came on in our tow car that we couldn't fix. The Honda dealer wanted to charge us an arm and a leg JUST to diagnose the problem. Who knows what they would have charged us to actually work on it. After seeing the great reviews for Anderson Auto we thought we had nothing to lose by giving them a try. They diagnosed the problem right away and it turned out to be nothing.  They did find a problem with our battery, put in a new one, and we were on our way at a very reasonable cost. It's hard to find places like this any more with honest, hard working people, who don't try to take advantage of you, knowing they will never see you again. They have renewed my faith in the human spirit. THANK YOU!!

Honesty and integrity are two rare qualities  alive and well at this location."
test_837,"I really hate being negative. However I would suggest skipping out on the brunch. Unless you love pastrys.the coffee is horrible. I am pretty sure that it is instance, ie just add watter and stir. And the rest well let's just say Karl Strauss Brewing Company can do brunch better and they make beer."
test_838,"Wife bought this for my Birthday. Exactly as I expected to be . One big promotion for the company and we are just along for the ride . 5 hours of my life gone . Landing was the best part . Biggest waste of time . The ride is 20 min . Setting up balloon 1 hour , putting away the balloon 1 hour . Champagne picture to promote there company another hour . No way for √ºber to pick you up . Land in the middle of nowhere. Thanks wife ."
test_839,"This place puts the A in Awesome! Full of fun items, from vintage everything to artisan jewelry items. Old cds, quality vtg clothes, books, home d√©cor. You name it. The element of surprise is on an all time high here.
 If you prefer the unique and unusual check this place out."
test_840,"I'll be the first male to write a review of this place. And yes they do alterations for male suits as well. At first, I saw the previous reviews and thought maybe this place only fixed up wedding gowns. So not true. Anyways, I do agree with the previous reviews saying that this place is legit. 

The two ladies who work there are very friendly and helped me get fitted into my new suit for an interview. The turn around time was a week and the price was moderate-to high (around $70) I had to alter my jacket, waist on the pants and the pants length. But the work they did was great. I have no complaints and the suit looks great and I feel great in it. Maybe you could find a cheaper place for alterations, but I'd rather go with a sure bet if you want it done right.

I think they only take cash or check  if I am not mistaken. No credit cards"
test_841,"Big, clean Food 4 Less - doesn't have the musty warehouse feel that some of the ones I've visited back home have had. This place is excellent for fresh produce, affordable cuts of meat, pantry staples, and cheap alcohol - I was even able to find a couple bottles of pretty decent wine for around $5. 

Even if you're just visiting, I recommend picking up a couple bottles of your alcohol of choice to have in your hotel room - we've saved a bundle doing this, and the stores in LV carry all the cool flavors of alcohol you're not going to find at home. We even go so far as buying mint and berries at Food 4 Less and muddling our own cocktails. I know, we are so FANSAY!

Already planning my next trip out and F4L, I'm lookin' at you."
test_842,I came here in November for my bachelorette weekend and it is a seasonal place. But I have loved coming here in the summer. Fresh food. And amazing atmosphere
test_843,"I had already had 2 cats (10yr old male and female I'd had since kittens when I lived in NYC), so I was a little hesitant on adding a new addition. J had been asking if we could get a new baby kitty for a few months, when I finally broke down and said yes. So, off we went to MCACC! 

The conditions of the kennels - Poor. 
I wanted to take every dog and cat home. If/when we win the lottery, I want to build a domestic animal sanctuary. :( When we got Linus home, we scheduled him for his free RAC visit and the vet stated that he had feline herpes. BS! He just had caught a bad cold due to his little immune system being compromised after his ""boys"" were chopped. Most cats come home with some form of kennel cough/cold. Just a shower steam every night and humidifier in his room for a week, and he was a good as new. 

The staff and volunteers - Excellent. 
Friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. 

The cost - Reasonable. 
We got Linus (aka Dooder) for $10 ($35 after FeLV/FIV testing.  Getting him fixed was included in the $10 fee.) He had been at the shelter for 2 months and was set to be destroyed, so he was the ""Cat of the Week"". The volunteer stated that most people are hesitant to adopt a black cat and that's why he was still at the shelter. I immediately fell in love with the little fuzzball when he snuggled up and started purring when I picked him up. 

All in all, I think the shelter is a wonderful place to adopt a new best friend and would wish for everyone to search out this option than going to a pet store. That and I wish there were more responsible pet owners and took Bob Barker's advice...

test_844,Had a destination wedding in Vegas and hired Omni Limo to take care of my guests transportation.  The shuttle bus was clean and new.  The driver was awesome.  Great prices and awesome service!
test_845,"The Chicken Mozzarella sandwich is really good particularly if you add the house made pesto sauce which was suggested by the bartender, Sebastian (sp?), whom by the way is a great bartender.  $5 half pitchers until 5 every day is a bargain as well as glasses of wine.  Good beer selection with a rotating local tap as well.  Not somewhere you'd catch the game (no tvs), but definitely a great lunch spot on the weekend.  Location is everything as well."
test_846,"My first trip the Caledonian was a bit of a mixed bag, and if Yelp had a 3.5 star rating, I'd be inclined to lean towards it.  However, I'm going to have to settle on a 3 star. 

Ok on to the details.....

Our group showed up at the Caledonian later in the evening for a night-cap and was told that on Thursday's the bar has last call at 1am. With a statutory holiday looming on the next day, a few fellow Yelpers piped up to say, ""Even on Holy Thursday!?' 

Yes...apparently even on Holy Thursday. 

Considering the bar was fairly full with patrons looking to unwind (get drunk) without the worry of an early morning the next day it certainly came as a bit of a surprise, and I'm sure the Caledonian missed out on a boatload of extra revenue. On the bright side, the waitress was more then understanding and let us nurse our beers until 2 am. (Disclaimer: After writing that last sentence, I adjusted the Yelp rating to a 4. Must give credit, where credit is due.)

The atmosphere and feel of the Caledonian is great and while I can't speak for the food they offer, they've got a great patio out back that smells like rich, new MDF board (Disclaimer 2: I once worked at a woodworking factory. When you head out back, look up under the awning. That my friend is MDF board...and yes it was brand spanking new on my visit). 

If the weather had of been a few degrees warmer I'm sure our group would have enjoyed our beers a little more. I can easily see this patio being a big hit come summer time and hopefully the scent of new MDF has subsided.

I'm looking forward to my next trek to the Caledonian this summer to enjoy a nice cold beer on the patio......I just hope that last call on the weekends is 2am!"
test_847,"Wow! What an amazing experience. Abdul, the owner and chef, welcomed us with a smile - - and the best humus I've ever had! The meal only improved from there. Excellent, friendly service; delicious food; and an adventurous atmosphere. 

Be aware that this is not Applebee's - - if you've never had Moroccan before, then be ready for a new experience. But regardless, give this place a try!!"
test_848,"One of the gauges of a good Chinese restaurant is the number of Chinese people who patronize the place. Emerald Chinese Restaurant has a lot of patrons.

My wife and I mainly come for the dim sum  brunch (9:00 AM ~ 11:00 AM) on weekends. The food is great, the place is clean, and there is ample parking around the restaurant. From within the restaurant, you can easily see outside as three of the four walls are made of glass. This gives the place a sense of airiness that some places we go to do not.

*The ideal time to come on weekends is between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. Come before 10 AM and not all the food is available yet. Come after 11 AM, expect to fall in line. 

The staff is efficient, but do not expect a lengthy conversation. For a place like this, this is not a put down. It's what I expect.

The quality of the dim sum is comparable to what you'd get in a good Hong Kong dim sum restaurant. The hot food is mostly brought out in steamer carts which means that it reaches your table hot and fresh. Fried foods and dessert items do not come in the steamer carts. The turnaround is pretty quick (a food cart seems to be depleted every two rounds of the tables) so very seldom is the food going around for too long. My personal favorites are the sweet pork - served either in a steamed bun or in flaky pastry, chicken feet, shrimp - served in a dumpling or the white rice wrap, pork and century egg congee, and the douhua (silken tofu) with syrup. My wife loves the giant oyster served on its shell with garlic and glass noodles.

There may be a few fancier places out there but if fancy is not that important to you, then this place is difficult to beat."
test_849,"We asked one of our Uber drivers for good hole in the wall type of place to eat I think you misunderstood and directed us to the hole in the wall.
He gave me some background story that the place used to be run and operated by the mafia and that the food was actually really good. My wife and I decided to go here for dinner and meet some of her friends that lived in the area they had never heard of the place once we got there we are very happy with the ambience and Amazed by the decoration and how every square inch of the place was covered with authentic stuff not manufactured or store-bought when we ordered the meals or very simple and the menu very clean and concise I decided to try the manicotti and my wife went with the muscles we are happily impressed that each meal came with a soup or salad you had two large bottles of both red and white wine your main course which had very large and feeling portions and a cappuccino to end the meal.
I I went with the mix salad because I'm not a huge fan of minestrone soup. For a salad being a salad it was kind of boring however the manicotti was absolutely amazing. THE Filling was very flavorful and the sauce on top was simple yet went well with the entire meal.
I sampled my wife's mussels and linguine and it also was very well seasoned and the flavor was amazing (sorry ma).
If you're in town and with a party of two or more I highly recommend this if you like Italian food probably one of the top places I've ever eaten for Italian."
test_850,"Bought a chocolate creme, banana creme and a key lime for a Friday night treat with the family.  Banana cream custard not cooked properly... Was completely running into the tin when cut into and flavor just was not there.  Chocolate creme was set properly.  Wasn't the best or the worst I've ever had.  The KEY LIME however, was fantastic!  Graham cracker crust was perfect thickness and delicious.  The key lime filling was great balance of tart and sweet.  Would stop by for another key lime but probably won't bother trying any onther flavors.  Only two stars because one out of three isn't very good..."
test_851,"Amazing gelato and awesome gelato!!!!! Best in las vegas!!! Really nice interior, super clean"
test_852,Beast burgers in Pittsburgh. Made from top quality cuts of beef cooked to order. And don't forget to order the zucchini!
test_853,"Went here Friday evening after work for happy hour around 630-7ish.  We ended up liking the atmosphere and posted up until like 11PM!  The music they played was actually pretty good, not ALL country music.  The crowd was interesting, 25-30 somethings with a few 50's sprinkled in the mix.  There was the normal Scottsdale crowd...you know, bedazzled jeans/belt buckles, shmedium sized shirts.  Then there were your random camo wearing cowboy hats.  And just your average people.  So it was a nice mix and definitely some great people watching.  

We had the Chips and Dip for $7.  It was.....bleh.  The chips were soggy and lip so in order to get the dip onto the chip you had to use a fork and fold it over. Eh.....

On a good note our bar tender was awesome !  She was super attentive (even once it got packed) and funny!  She made killer drinks and chatted it up with us ladies, and if you're a lady...you know that can be quite rare.  

Another interesting thing is their band is above the bar.  So, if you're sitting at the bar you just see flailing arms, the end of a guitar and the occasional hair flip.  The band on Friday was not too great so we preferred the DJ over the live brand which is surprising.  The later it got into the evening the longer the line got leading up to the door.  When I go back again I will be doing it the same way I did (happy hour into the night), I don't foresee myself waiting in line to get in. 

I am looking forward to going back and sitting at a booth with a little mini tap and ordering some beer and kicking back.  Maybe having food with a little more substance in hopes that it's yummier than the Chips and Dip.  I will definitely be back to this bar!"
test_854,"This place reminds me of a cheaper version of Melt Bar & Grill, but it is just as tasty!  This location is a small hole in the wall, literally, but they are friendly and fairly quick.  Their fries are very different from what I'm used too, but good.  I ordered the Wayne Dawson, it was wonderful in flavor, but messy, like a sloppy joe.  I can't give them 5 stars because I wish they would have had better napkins than those dinky things that come from the holder and I would have liked a utensil of some sort.  A fork or spoon would have been nice as my sandwich kept falling apart."
test_855,"This place is awesome. Not just because of the cartoon ice cream drawings on the wall or because of the plushie Pusheen holding a little ice cream cone behind the counter but because of its amazing assortment of unique flavors. 

We got there late at night and all crowded around the display of ice cream options available. The staff there was super nice about all our questions and generous with samples. I think we all tried about 3 or 4 flavors each before deciding on what to get. We decided to go for three scoops in a cup: hojicha (roasted green tea), earl grey and black sesame, which was then topped with a piece of a waffle cone on top so it looks like an upside down ice cream cone. 

The black sesame almost tasted like peanut butter, very rich compared to the earl grey and hojicha which were a lot lighter. The flavors worked really well together and it was a nice late night treat. 

They also have vegan options as well. If I'm ever in the area again I'm definitely going to stop by for another scoop...maybe the raspberry."
test_856,"Worked with Jim who made my first shopping experience in charlotte absolutely amazing. After being misled at a previous furniture store, Jim saved the day! Great customer service and overall experience, would highly recommend for anyone looking for anything related to mattresses and bedding!"
test_857,"Meh, prime location so I expected better. Typical late night bar food being served in a restaurant. I would had to have been drunk to enjoy the food. Don't waste your time or $"
test_858,"This place is a good bet for decent happy hour food and drinks at good prices.  I came a little after 9:30 on a week night and it was not busy, but there were a few tables in the bar area. The server was attentive, polite and food came out hot and quick. Can't say it's the most authentic Mexican food, nor the very best, but it certainly has a place in the world and I will be back. The patio is nice too."
test_859,Worst customer service and horrible quality I've never had my nails look so bad and that's besides the fact that he nipped my skin about 6 times hurt so badly and would just keep going NEVER WILL I RETURN
test_860,"Love love this place, food is great, it's kind of a tapas place , they do catered for a younger crowd, sit and mingle kind if this. It's is also kind of a tapas place very small plate, but very tasty. I love the fried pickle, my favorite. Price is very reasonable 3 of us and we order a few plates and my husband had 1 glass of wine and our bill was like $45.00. I  just wish the had parking, cause I was pregnant and the walking distant was not that close from where we park."
test_861,I was recently given a snake from my friend and thought about coming here for frozen mice. I called first and was told two frozen mice were four bucks. The place isn't too far away from me so I made the trek but when I got there I was NOT greeted by the kid behind the counter (red flag). He was busy with another customer so I waited.... and waited... and waited still not having been greeted. I had to wait for two more employees before one asked me what I needed. When I told him he told me mice where 30 dollars! The girl I had talked to on the phone was standing right there and said nothing so I left. I had to call and come back again to straighten it out but I definitely will be driving a lot farther to feed my snake than coming here...
test_862,"Pretty decent grocery store. Good sales and selection. Lines are always long, usually because of dim lit people unsure how to work the debit pad or taking their sweet time. Really wish they had a hot food and a deli counter, cashiers are great but I wish they would just bag your groceries for you."
test_863,Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.
test_864,"There have been only a few times that my co-workers and I have gone somewhere and ordered three different dishes, and everyone of them was delicious.  This was one of those times.   They do everything right here.   The fish is delicious, but that's not to say that their menu won't delight a non-seafood eating person as well.  They really have all the bases covered.  It will definitely be added to my standard rotation of restaurants."
test_865,"Been there many times, though not a regular, but after being served by Eve I think I'll make it a regular stop. The drinks are great, the music stellar and while other bartenders are great Eve secured my regular attendance!"
test_866,"Staff is super helpful when my party couldn't decide what we wanted.  Service was fast and packaged quite well (take out).  

Barbecue pork shoulder was good, ribs were great, buns were good.  Something wasn't quite right with the sides though, we had coleslaw, potato salad, fries and beans (though I didn't try the beans) and while they were good, they were underseasoned and just missing something.  

Overall a very satisfying experience and I would definitely go back!"
test_867,"The food is good, not great! Priced decently and busy but that's where the issue comes in! First the positive... the waitress did a great job, food came out sorta promptly. We had a large party 11 folks, the reservations were attempted on line, but because the group was over 6 people we were required to call the location directly. We were told ""the entire party had to be there before being seated"" ... we initially had planned for 5pm but told 6 - 6:15 was best they could offer to seat the entire party together. Everybody was there by 5:45 and the reception area was n9tified we were all ready... we were still on track for 6pm as a large party had just been given the check... so it wouldn't be long. Surprisingly another large party of 13 were told that the table was being held and would be given to the next in line if they were not ready. Not everybody had yet arrived, and the restaurant seated 5 of the 13 and the rest wandered in later. (Contrary to the ""all must be present before party seated"" rule..... special circumstances or they were buddy buddy with someone)  when one of the managers was questioned about lighting a fire under the party ""that had been given their check (now 6:05).. the manager said ""We figure an hour to an hour fifteen"" so they would ask the folks relaxing after another 20 minutes, and we'd all be seated at that time."" 
  When we did get seated (for a birthday dinner) instead of being seated together, the party was split between 2 tables across the busy aisle exiting the kitchen.....Los much for being seated together!  One would expect if they couldn't seat the entire party together in the first place they would not have taken a large reservation in the first place! 
 My serious recommendation if your party is under 4 people, make reservations by phone and still anticipate 20-30 minute wait. If your party is 6 or more, consider another restaurant such as longhorn, or outback first! At least you won't be appreciated as a patron. The initial service received by the 2 managers and reception staff along with seating arrangement spoiled the evening and dining experience! 
 In the future, I may try a different location, but like others in our party will neither recommend or go to this location ever again!"
test_868,"Service was friendly and prompt. Location is great and the decor is fun.

Unfortunately the food was sub-par and oversalted.  I had the carnitas and had to send them back to the kitchen exchange for chicken fajitas because they were so salty I couldn't stomach choking down a whole plate. The chicken fajitas were ok but rather dry. I had a strawberry frozen magarita that tasted soley like cheap tequila.

I've been previously and the food was solid. So maybe the kitchen was having a bad noght."
test_869,"Overall: Asian fusion buns with a unique flavor profile twist that includes earl grey, matcha, Hong Kong style, Japanese,  Tawainese and French.

Sample: there are  bread samples for you to taste before you buy

Cleaniness: unlike other Chinese bakeries that reuse the trays and tongs, they do clean it before reusing

Cost: range from about $ 2.90-5$ for buns- I didn't check the pastries

Taste:  bought the Earl grey twist, matcha red bean bun and it tasted great.

Value and would I come back:  probably not - the price seems a bit inflated.  For a one time experience for breakfast or snack, it's not a bad idea."
test_870,"I went here for brunch today and it was a neat little place but the food was just a little above average.

First they give you a small bowl of granola, which tasted salty to me but it tasted better on top of my crepe.

I ordered a vanilla bean crepe which is a large crepe, chopped up strawberries, candied pistachios, vanilla bean cream on the side and a big dot of caramel. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. 

I came in around 10am and it looked like every table was taken but luckily I found 1 table inside that was available. 

The setup is you order and pay first then you go pick your seat and the person looks for your number to deliver your food."
test_871,"Good place to pop in for a quick high-end snack, but the price tag adds up really quickly if you're having a meal for two. We had the oxtail soup (excellent) spicy lettuce duck wraps (not bad) and the dim sum, which was kind of dry. I'd come back for oxtail soup to go."
test_872,"stars with my experienced for the following reason

1. Customer service experienced - awesome, he explained everything and how it works
2. Frosted sugar pink cookie - delish ( not too sweet for my taste)
3. Rebel drink- kinda weird taste for me, but love the after taste and since has monster drink, love it.. keep me awake to study.
4. Popcorn - just one word FRESH
5. Location - very accessible and lots of parking


Locals and non locals, need to try this place.. IT IS SIMPLE and UNIQUE"
test_873,Very good burgers and fries.  The bun was just okay.  Atmosphere also ok.  Very loud.  The burgers with fries are $11.  But the burger was worth it.
test_874,this place is absolutely amazing. (good) italian vegan food is hard to find and this is the place to go. i had the veggie balls and the vegan baked ziti and added mushrooms. every bite was amazing. good for sharing bc the portions are HUGE. I've never been able to finish anything from here in one sitting.
test_875,"Food is decent. But the hostess is simply awful. She is rude and mean and surprisingly makes the whole experience negative. 

We will not be returning because of her."
test_876,Delicious food!  Huge portions (next time I'll get the small bowl)!  AMAZING white chocolate cheesecake
test_877,"This place is a hidden gem. Definitely the kind of family-owned restaurant that makes you want to root for their success. 

I had the Bubba Grubba breakfast which included a half order of biscuits and gravy, two eggs over medium, homemade sausage and a delicious slice of thick cut bacon. I also opted for a side of fruit - it was perfectly ripe and delicious. The drip coffee was pretty standard but no complaints! 

Their menu contains a nice selection to choose from but not too big. I had a hard time deciding what to get because several options caught my
Eye. I'll definitely be back. 

What do I think makes this place extra special though? The staff. They clearly know each other really well - in a good way - and communicate like a family. That connection and their love translates into their service. I got the sense that I was at my grandma or aunties house for Sunday breakfast and that's a rare vibe to catch these days. 

Every neighborhood needs a great diner with great comfort food. And this place fits the bill. Do yourself a favor and give 'em a go."
test_878,Great massage place very affordable! I've been here for 2 hours wow only $22 for an hour massage ? Can't beat that
test_879,Great little place with so many unusual finds. Loe to stop in and see what is new. I have found a few nice gifts here and my daughter bought a dress.
test_880,"I recently visited Star Nursery to research and find plants and containers to accomplish an opportunity to begin a business endeavor I have dreamed I would succeed.
I was overwhelmed by the interest the employees I met and assisted me with this endeavor.  I returned several days in a row to order product, select additional plants as my project grew with success!
I would not have been able to satisfy my client and receive their honor without the these employees who made it possible.
The Manager, Marco, who helped me be within my project budget with genuine care; Erica with her knowledge of their plant inventory - came to my aid when alternate choices were required; Richard helped with ordering containers - calling me with notice when they arrived; Brandon & Alfredo who worked their delivery schedules to assist my time of need; the girls at the checkout register - Courtney and Ivonne - showed a sincere interest and eagerness to help with care - requesting the results of my 'First Account' in my Dream adventure!
I do not want to forget Wesley, the delivery person who called when he was leaving the nursery with each delivery of three days.  Called when he delivered to my project site- verify each item!
This experience exceeded my expectations of Customer Service!  I am from an era where Customers were expected to be treated with Special Care!  I thought this attitude was from a forgotten Time!
""Thank You Star Nursery employees who truly made my Dream take a real step forward!""
Forgive me if I missed someone special!
I look forward working with you on future endeavors!

test_883,Wife and I went for breakfast. Got there before the rush so we had no wait.  Ample servings.  Food was good. Service was fair.
test_884,new thai resto moved into the neighbourhood so def wanted to check it out. I have been so busy with business and family that i still didn't have the opportunity to go. My husband went for lunch today and brought me a tom yum soup.... and damn was it good. perfect amount of everything..... cant wait to actually go have dinner here  as the menu looks unique to what i am used to with thai.
test_885,"For the price this is the best restaurant in the MGM and surrounding hotels. The fish and chips is ousts ding, and the service is spot on! Everyone is extremely friendly!!! I would highly recommend this place"
test_886,"We ate at Bahia Centroamerica for the first time last night and were pleasantly surprised.  The decor inside is pretty cute and we were immediately transported back to Central America.  My son lived in Nicaragua for 2 years, so he was excited to try some of the dishes on the menu from there.  Unfortunately, they were out of quite a few things he wanted, but we enjoyed the dishes we did get.  Service was slow with only one waitress caring for everyone by herself, but she was very sweet.  The 2 TV's played a soccer game and a classic soap opera, which made everything feel more authentic.  We arrived at 7:30 PM, so next time we'll go early and, hopefully, they won't be out of some of the food we wanted.  We'll go back."
test_887,"Great mom and pop bakery with an excellence quality ingredients and unique design. I ordered the green tea tiramisu and it was delightful. Not your typical tiramisu, they did not use ladyfingers but light sponge cake instead. I liked the light taste of its creme, it was not too sweet and I could still taste the green tea. I wish they can make it bigger since this particular cake only comes in 8 or 10 inches. Decently priced cake. Advance notice is recommended for special cake. Must try!"
test_888,"Very large menu selection, and very reasonable prices, and the outside patio is nice.  I'm very picky about wanting my eggs well done, and bacon soft and greasy - and I don't always get it this way, but today the waitress was a champ!  And it was nice to be able to get fries rather than their fried potato chunks.

I only wish the food stayed warmer longer while out on the patio."
test_889,"Jade red chicken, jerk chicken quesdilla, black beans, jerk fried rice. Don't question me. JUST. DO. IT. I crave this daily."
test_890,"Was gonna try this place but then I saw from another reviewer that THE VEGETARIAN OPTIONS LISTED ON THEIR MENU CONTAIN MEAT. I also saw Davlen's (who I'm assuming is the owner) snotty response to a reviewer who reasonably expected that a dish that is listed as vegetarian not contain any meat products in it. Here's a tip, Davlen, if your dish contains meat products then don't list it as vegetarian!"
test_891,"This place is a hidden treasure.  3 different restaurants on the same grounds, all hidden away from the rest of South Phoenix.    Good food, good service, outdoor seating, beautiful grounds to stroll around on, plenty of parking, a cute little vegetable garden, a country store and much more."
test_892,"This location is very nice. Parking looks like it's at a premium, but I've never had a problem finding a spot. The employees are nice and helpful, and the store is always clean and well organized. It is a little tight in there, but it's worth it for the huge selection. I hadn't been to a Pier 1 in years before coming in here two weeks ago, and I've already been back once after that initial visit."
test_893,Kobe Sushi never disappoints! I literally inhale all that I order here. I will keep coming back!
test_894,"Terrible experience here. The service was terrible (not the intentionally terrible kind that is to be expected of these franchises) and the food was way overpriced. Everyone in my group was dissatisfied with their experience as well. I would never return to this place, even for a free meal."
test_895,"First time here, never been or heard of this little spot before. Talk about pricey...$10 for a smoothie or juice...get outta here. I dont care how ""healthy"" it is. Funny thing is, all the people in front of me in line, were so unahppy with the way their drinks tasted they would try and return their drinks or ask to have something added. Thought that was interesting. Anyways, im not sure i would go back, but defintely glad i tried it. Oh and by the way i had the Spicy Watermelon Cooler/Splash...it was alright, didnt taste so healthy though as advertised :/"
test_896,I love everyone there. The staff and dentist are very helpful and attentive to my needs. They left me smiling and I look forward to my next cleaning.
test_897,"I haven't been here in a long time and I've been taking about it to my wife for a while and we decided to go when we were in the area. Not only did I grow up in Charlotte, but I grew up in New Orleans too. So, I would call myself a Cajun food expert. 

There aren't that many places in or around Charlotte that have Louisiana/New Orleans level Cajun food and I always considered CYD to be one of them. However, on this trip, I just wasn't impressed. Years ago, I would swear this was the best place in town, but not so much now. Not to mention the prices are a little on the high side. With the food competition cranking up, you have to have really great food to charge high prices. 

It's always sad to see a restaurant you use to call the best not live up to its expectations, but it wasn't terrible either. The service was great, the atmosphere was great, it's just the food was decent and the prices were too high. 

I'll save my next Cajun food craving for when I'm in New Orleans."
test_898,A bank for those of us who work banker's hours. Got a cheque languishing in our wallet for months? Take it over to TD to open a new account. Never a line on Saturday morning where the folks here are more than happy to take care of all your banking needs. Not pushy about what to do with your money. Open later in the evening and early part of Saturday. The folks here know what to do to get your money where you want it.
test_899,Annie did an amazing job on lengthening the shelves on my sons suit jacket! She completed on time as promise.
test_900,"I'll start by saying the one and only thing I didn't like about The Chelsea: the fact that seating for Adele's concert was behind the general admission, which was standing. 
C'mon; I wanna be as close as possible to the stage as can be!

Then again, once the thousands of people began filling up the front, I was thankful to have a seat and my own personal space. 
It was paaaaacked down there and I would've been super irritated if I was getting pushed and shoved...AND I'm tiny...could u imagine?

Once the Adele show started, everything was right in the world again.
I'm just thankful that Cosmo was able to get her to Vegas considering we weren't included in her original tour dates."
test_901,"Average place. Not much else around so the locals flock to this place and make them rich. Menu is pricey and quantity not that great or at least mine was not, nothing like the pictures below. I didn't feel like this place is ""much"" better than other places who cater to the same type of crowd. Not a place I would go out of my to go to. I didn't have a bad experience but the fanfare this place gets and from the posts below might be misleading to someone looking into going here."
test_902,Authentic delicious food. Yolanda was our server and was super. Definitely worth the trip! Will come back.
test_903,"This review is for just the gym facilities as I've never tried the tanning or purchased any products. There's a solid array of cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights (including an Olympic lifting platform/power cage combo with bumper plates, another power cage, and a Smith machine). 

The pros: 
24 hours access with your keycard
no-contract membership options
lockers (bring your own lock)
sweat towels provided
friendly employees 

The cons: 
no showers
inconsistent membership rates (my friends got quoted several different rates than what I pay) 
Small space can get packed
Some of the equipment is showing signs of wear (ripped pads on weight machines and cracks in the weight benches pads and the numbers have rubbed off on some of the dumbbells, so you can't tell what the weight is. I wouldn't think it would be that hard to slap some stickers on there but it's been that way for months. 
often dirty - especially the mirrors in front of the power cages which ALWAYS have peoples' spit sprayed all over them. I have personally wiped weird black/brown splotches off the Olympic lifting platform (are people shitting themselves during squats??) and it's always built up again the next time I go.

Overall it's a decent gym that gets the job done if you live in the area."
test_904,"The food was great, but right when we walked in it smelled like sewage. Hopefully they'll get that fixed ASAP!"
test_905,"If your looking for a retail shop that sells high end knives at a normal price(comparable to the internet and not MSRP) then this is your KNIFE GUY. He is friendly and seemed knowledgeable about his merchandise. There is no other place that I know of in town that is comparable. He however, does not carry many cheap knives if you go see him be prepared to spend at least $100 for a pretty nice knife."
test_906,"Location is great... but as far as the hotel room goes... I will never ever stay again! Here's why: DILDO FOUND ON BATHROOM FLOOR UNDER SINK! (No joke!) Makes you want to question how clean your room really is if that was missed right? I was given Room #666... Spoke with the manager, Eloy (not sure if I spelled his name correctly) stated that he can not move me to another room because no rooms were available... and could not comp my room because I booked through a third party. So instead, gave me a $20 credit to go towards drinks at their bar downstairs and late check out. Really? That's the best you could do! Like I really want to stay longer then I need to after seeing that nastiness left in my room. Also, there was a bloody boogar found at the top of the headboard. Cleaning lady cleaned it but before she did she says, ""oh like you never do that in your car and fling it"". Omg really? Look lady, i would prefer not to see other peoples boogars in a hotel room that I paid to stay at... and if you would've done your job, there wouldn't have been a bloody boogar or a damn dildo left in the room! DISGUSTING!!!"
test_907,"tends to covered in goose shit most of the year.  not the best around, but very cheap."
test_908,Walked in and the clerk was on the phone reporting that the staff had just found a gun in one of the rooms.  Went to get my luggage and the stairs were blocked by some girl and a guy having an argument.  No elevator so i went all the way around to the other stairs and passed a druggie type with stains all over his clothes coming from by the pool and zipping up his pants.  Room was supposed to be non-smoking but their attempt to disguise the smoke smell with too much industrial detergent made me sneeze all night.  Toilet had left-over urine in it because it didn't flush right.  Didn't sleep a wink because of traffic noises and safety concerns.  Checked out the next morning instead of stayIng for the full 2 nights I booked.  WORST PLACE EVER!!!  Called corporate to complain and all they offered was a gift certificate to stay at another Motel 6.  REALLY???
test_909,Hands down this bakery makes THE BEST cannolis and I've tried many. The shell is the best - fresh & crispy! The come in small & large and if they're sold out they will make you fresh ones. I would recommend this bakery to anyone!
test_910,"Holy amazing service. I came in to get a few recalls fixed and yes they slightly tried to up sell but respectfully backed off when I said I wasn't interested. However, hands down the best service I've ever had from a dealership. Polite. And they even provided a free shuttle to my office even though I was only there to get recalls fixed and didn't end up spending a dime with them."
test_911,"Fresh and quality sashimi and great lunch time prices.  I tried it for lunch once and I am a fan, there are few quality Japanese restaurants in the city but this is amazing (even though it's Korean owned) and great value for the money.  Great decor and swift service."
test_912,Amazing place food is tasty. Portions are huge got number 23 beef and tikka man good stuff. Great friendly staff and fast service. Food is made fresh on grill. Rice and salad come with your plate.
test_913,"Today I was at the Carnegie Library for the annual seed swap. What a fun party. The library was a great place to learn about all of the things that you can plant, how to plant them, and where to plant them. And even though they had teachers they're the best part of it being a library you could always just go and find books on the topic.

The library was a great venue because it was large enough to accommodate the many things that the seed swap was doing as well as not disrupt the loyal patrons just looking to get books out. I love the library and I really love this event.

The staff here always really helpful and will always point you in the right direction. So if you have any questions make sure that you reach out to them because they will help you in any way that they can.

There's also a Crazy Mocha inside of the library so if you need us something to snack on or drink while perusing the shelves it's there. I personally like an iced tea while I'm reading but you get whatever you want.

Well this is not my local neighborhood Library I still love coming here. It always has fun events and great service. Check it out if you're in Oakland it's a beautiful building and will be awesome to get some books out from here. Tell me what you think!!!"
test_914,"This was a surprise find. My sister and I had been planning to eat somewhere else for dinner but when we got there the place was closed for the holidays. She found Tumi Fine nearby and we were on our way.
Neither of us had ever tried Peruvian food and I think Tumi Fine was an excellent place to start. Seemed like a hole-in-the-wall place with soccer (futbol) playing on the tv's and plastic chairs, but once we were served our meal it seemed just right. Popped corn kernels as appetizers, fried yucca, warm starchy potatoes and saucy meat filled us up in no time."
test_915,"I've never been to New York, but I really want to go if the pizza here is an accurate representation.  The place looks like a nice pizzeria/diner in the big city with pictures of New York on the walls, and they serve up great  food from their mother land.  
 
I had a really good experience here.  The service was friendly and fast, and the food was out of this world.  I took advantage of their pizza by the slice offer, and wow.  Like I said I've never been to the big apple, but I'm guessing this would give guys up there a run for their money."
test_916,"This store is clean, staff is friendly and parking lot is easy to navigate. I like the six inch veggie delight in wheat. Bread is fresh, veggies are never old. Sandwiches made with love at this location!"
test_917,"Big fan of their gnocchi. Always pleasant service and food comes out relatively quickly. They have a small restaurant, tables are pretty close together but it gives that small Italian cafe feel. Love that they have a covered patio with heaters so you can enjoy sitting outside rain or shine."
test_918,Sweet and savory! We ordered Nutella crepe and tomato with cheese. It was really good i just wish they diced the tomatoes rather than being big chunks .
test_919,"I don't know what the issue is, but they obviously have one at this location.  Food backed up at the window,  or not done properly.  We come here all the time but not anymore.  Too many screw ups and lousy service.  They used to be good but their standards have slipped big time"
test_920,"I've been going the Glenway Premium. Pub for years! I have nothing but good things to say about it. I have enjoy may meal and fun time at the Glenway. The food and drinks are moderately priced. Although the staff has changed from time to time the service and commitment to consistent quality food and customer service has not changed. The food is prepared daily, served fresh, very tasty and served within a reasonable wait time. Although it can become very pack at time and the waiting time for can lager, the serving crew do there best to meet the customer expectations of a quality served meal. The menu consists of southern and Americana appetizer, the chicken wings are the best with many types to choose from, the burgers are made with the highest quality of beef, the salad are the freshest and tasty as can be. They offer daily special on drinks, beer and food items. The beer bar none is the best in town and elsewhere. The craft beers and premium bourbons selection is top notch. Offering a variety of North Carolina, South Carolina and other eastern regional craft beers and at time when available other highly sought after limited edition craft brews throughout America. The bourbon selection is a fine quality selection of some the finest mid to high end brands available to stimulate any bourbon drinker palet. The waitresses are polite, accommodating, very friendly and above all attentive to the patrons needs. Parking is ample and plenty across the street from the Glenway Premium Pub. All in all the Glenway Premium Pub is a hidden jewel in a laid back charming community of Belmont, NC and well worth a visit for our family, friends and party get to gathers. Give them a try I'm sure you will enjoy it!"
test_921,I've been in lots of so call pizzeria but this one is my favorite. The dough is do crunchie and very good.
test_922,"Has all the right qualities to develop young minds and bodies. My kids are not just learning karate, but they are learning about how to deal with life and it's challenges"
test_923,"So, I was hungry and I decided to eat at Subway which is next door, I noticed there was this barber shop so I thought to myself that I needed a haircut. There was 2 barbers working that day, they were both busy with customers plus 1 more customer waiting. I walked in, they acknowledged me and I asked if they accepted credit cards, they replied Yes! I sat down waiting patiently for my turn for about 20 mins. One of the barbers was done with his customer, he took the next customer... He was done with that customer and it was my turn, BUT NO IT WASN'T!!! Someone else walked in and they started cutting his hair. I felt discriminated against because they knew I was there, if that customer had already made an appointment for that time or if he was waiting outside, I don't know that! The barber should have at least said they had already been waiting their turn or had an appointment. I got no explanation of why they ignored me! One thing I'm sure, there are most of them good reviews but left a bad taste in my mouth so they will not get my business in the future."
test_924,"Best sushi ever.  The most fresh and clean tasting sushi around. I find myself daydreaming of this place at least once or twice a week. The drinks are phenomenal, I recommend the pink flamingo martini.  Not particularly impressed with the hibachi but it's just not the style I prefer to eat by. We've been trying to take everyone we know there!"
test_925,"The sauce is way too sweet. I know some of their customers like it that way, but it'd be great if there were an alternative sauce on the menu for customers who want a more authentic Italy or New York experience. I live right around the corner from this place and never ever go, not even when they have a super cheap carryout special. It's not awful, just not the type of pizza or pasta I like to eat."
test_926,"Great food, clean and delicious, great service. Wide menu to choose from; did not try the pizza."
test_927,"Buritto Boyz beats any local fast-food Mexican spot in Toronto.  Expect to wait in a long line come 2-3am on a Friday or Saturday night after the club/bar, but the food is well-worth the wait.  I've ordered both the chicken and sweet potato burritos.  Both are tasty and seasoned well without too much salt.  

What I truly like about this place is that there are a variety of options, even gluten-free tortillas!  The price is always right; you can order a large chicken or sweet potato burrito with a combo (salsa and chips, a drink) for about $10.  To be honest, I would probably opt-out of the combo next time, as I felt the chips were a bit on the greasy side.

Great spot, great food, well worth the wait!"
test_928,"As someone who grew up on New York Pizza, Im kinda hard to please. This place is probably the best in the neighborhood. Also shout out to the dude who just took my order over the phone for being concise, quick, and repeating everything back."
test_929,"Fresh, hand-made pepperoni rolls..... oh yeah. Their cheesy focattia  (did I spell that right?) is amazing. Take it home, throw it in the oven, drizzle a little EVOO on top and you're golden. Friendly people there. Parking sucks, but I'm not taking off a point for that! 



p.s. Their marinara is dee-lish"
test_930,"This nail spa barely deserves a one star rating.  I gave it more than 20 chances.  When I first discovered the place, it advertised $35 for mani/pedi. The price was impressive and so was the service.  
Unfortunately, the price kept climbing, despite the $35 falsely advertised deal, boldly appearing in the window.  Also, the service has gone downhill.  For example, the instrument used for my bio gel became hot and burned me.  I tried to pull away, but was told its fine.  Also, the shellac did not stay on for even a week.  They recommended I go for bio gel, which i did.  At nearly $65, I have now gone back twice within the first 2 days of having it done.  I was met with eye rolling and certainly did not feel welcome.  It's peeling off now, what a waste of $65!!!
This time I've learned my lesson and will not be going back."
test_931,"First time here with my friend. They sat us at a huge booth which was awesome because there was only 2 of us. Our waiter was super friendly and awesome. We both got burgers which were so good and the fries were awesome too. Excellent service, I would go back just to get that server again! haha."
test_932,The house wine was terrible. The garlic bread felt like it was dusty. The chicken Parmigiana was somewhere under the sauce.
test_933,"Went here last year with our neighbor friend so when we got to the house from OC, we decided to go here so friends could try it.
For drinks we ordered chandelier, margarita and some drink I forgot the name lol.  Everything was excellent.
For appetizers, the portobello mushrooms (good but a little salty) and calamari (very bland).  
For entr√©es sausage pesto linguine, clam pasta, steak Diane and lasagna.  Tasted all the dishes and everything was very good.
This restaurant is very close to the house, I'm sure we will be back here."
test_934,"I have to concur with a lot of the past reviews.  This place is a tourist trap, but unlike most people I find that to be what made this place unique in Pittsburgh.  Every city has one, so why should Pittsburgh be any different?

You can surely spend a day or more down here if you were to do everything there is to offer.  Every possible way of touring the city is available here, from the Just Ducky tour to Segway.  It's a good place to come and just pass the day, you can sit in the common area and watch the city across the river go about its business for the day.

There are downsides to this place and the one obvious thing here is the parking.  No matter what, if you drive here, you will have to pay to park.  Unless you depend on public transportation, there is no way around that.  Once you get the parking situation out of the way you can go about your business.

Restaurants are diversified down here, a majority of cuisines are covered.  Dine where you please and take your time eating your meal.  There is a ""mall"" here, but it's nothing more than remnants of once was.  That part of the complex is called The Freight Shops.  There are a few shops here that are basically mom and pop spots with a business school mixed in.  What should be noted is that once where the nightclub complex was is no longer.  That building no longer stands as the rumors say that they are putting up a residential complex.  Also gone is the amphitheater, now there is a soccer stadium that houses the Pittsburgh Riverhounds.

As I said before, this place is a great way to waste a day here.  It's not meant to be a place to go every single day, it is meant to be a place to gather with people.  Whether that be for a night out or if you have a visitor coming in from out of town."
test_935,Perfect place to do your nails and eye brow waxing. There services were exceptional. They used very good products and the place was so clean!
test_936,"Came in last night for my gfs 21st birthday. We had dinner at yard house and the plan was to have drinks and dessert here after.... We should have just stayed at YH. 

My Gf had a reservation all set up, they even called to confirm with her a few days ago. When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server ""they didn't even have a reservation"" it's not like we needed one, there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied, and for good reason...

I've dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location. The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card. Our table was being completely ignored. I've been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for. I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there's but nothing. It never happened. It really put a damper on the night. 
There are so many places in Vegas especially to celebrate your 21st and we chose here... But we will never make that mistake again. I would be much happier paying full price for the other location or somewhere else entirely."
test_937,"My cousin was involved in an accident in Vegas and his car was destroyed. While he was in the hospital he was issued a ticket for going through a red light.  We were referred to Wooldridge Law by a firm in Salem, Oregon and we are extremely happy that we used Wooldridge Law.  The entire staff were awesome and worked very hard on our behalf to resolve this matter. We cannot say enough good things about how hard they worked for us. If you ever need or have a problem please call Wooldridge Law Ltd. They are the best!!!!"
test_938,After 3 emails and 1 phone call-----still unable to setup a appointment  for a free estimate. Amy is not good for your business.
test_939,"Food was delicious but this has been the worst service I've experienced in a while. There were only two waitresses on a Friday night - both EXTREMELY inattentive. We had to wave them down multiple times when we wanted to order, get some water, get water refills, and get take out boxes. I also saw one of the waitresses drop some napkins onto the floor, pick them up and put them back on a dining table."
test_940,"I drove my friends mom to this pharmacy on 6/22/16 to pick up her medication. When she got there the pharmacy was extremely busy. Something happened with her personal insurance being switched to Medicare which caused her old insurance to cancel making her prescriptions prices hundreds of dollars. She was in shock because the price was so high and she couldn't afford it. A pharmacy technician named Antonio who was extremely busy with a long line of people waiting for their medicine, went out of his way to help my friends mom get her insurance back to her original insurance coverage. He is a very educated pharmacy technician and I hope he becomes a Pharmacist because he would be a great one. Antonio walked us through the process while he was super busy to get the situation figured out. I'm in sales and take pride in excellent customer service because that's what it's all about. Antonio went above and beyond for us and helped us for two hours as my friends mom was on the phone trying to figure everything out. He guided my friends mom and helped get her insurance problem fixed. I just want to say thank you to Antonio in the pharmacy and give that man a raise. He impressed me with his calmness and his patience for people who are clueless on how their insurance actually works. Antonio may you be successful in all your endeavors and thank you for excellent customer care. Cheers my friend!!!"
test_941,The ambience here is super cool and the menu was great with lots of items. They even serve beee too! Good place to stop-by if you are a vegetarian!
test_942,"I was really craving a chocolate babka so I drove here to get one. The lady said they only do them by special order so I just got a box of pastries instead. I got a few cookies, a mini cheesecake, and some delicious pecan bars. I can't remember the name but they were shortbread with nuts and caramel and then dipped in chocolate. They were delicious. When she rang me up, she gave me a free loaf of Italian bread because they were closing. The bread was pretty good. I didn't really like the sesame seeds on top but it tasted fresh! I am happy to have a mom and pop bakery on this side of town! I will be back!"
test_943,"Why yes.... I love ridiculously Americanized cream cheese and avocado-stuffed deep-fried makizushi (if you can even still call it that). And I make no apologies! Purists be damned. That being said, Sakana's rainbow roll, philly roll, and crunchy eel rolls were totally melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Crunchy eel had to be my favorite. Flaming phoenix was pretty good, too. 

I have to back up a bit.... I started with the ahi tataki salad. It's way bigger in person than it looked in the photo, and sooooo good (note: I normally HATE salads, just ordered it for the seared tuna and ended up eating a good amount of the salad itself). I also tried the spicy tuna roll and it was a big disappointment... BARELY any spice and the tuna tasted a little fishy, definitely not as scrumptious as the tuna in the salad. But I had so many other yummy things to nosh on, I didn't mind abandoning the spicy tuna. 

I'm not sure if it's a regular thing, but they had 50c appetizers if you order a Kirin. The prices on all the dishes were totally reasonable. They DON'T have a full bar, I'm not sure why there are 3 votes for that."
test_944,"I ordered a chicken main with sweet potatoes and noodles. I liked the potatoes/noodles, but didn't find the chicken to be too good. The pumpkin smoothie was very good. It's a trendy, healthy restaurant, but I wouldn't rush back. Nothing stood out here for me."
test_945,"I am a simple woman, with simple needs...like, I expect sushi at SUSHI D. 

Let me preface this by saying this is not my first time here. My friends and I went to UofT and have been on many occasions for some moderately-priced AYCE sushi. It's supposed to be reliable in quality. 

I'll start from the very beginning. We should've clued in that shit was not going well when we first sat down and the waitress told us there were not enough glasses for us to have water. She accommodated by giving us water bottles. Cool! Great service! Oh how wrong we were. 

We start to order various rolls, apps, sushi and sashimi. We were 6 people, but it wasn't too much food as we planned on ordering more afterwards. After ordering, we wait about 15 mins and get some rock shrimp. While eating this plate of rock shrimp, the waitress comes to us and says ""We do not have sushi, is that okay?"" Confused, we asked her to repeat herself several times. She seemed frustrated as we asked repeatedly...but can you fucking blame us for being confused when they tell us they don't have SUSHI AT A SUSHI RESTAURANT??? We clarified with her that they have rolls and sashimi. But just not sushi. Uh, okay. I guess we were okay with it. Huge mistake. 

For some weird reason, the only thing they would serve us in a timely manner is spider rolls and salmon sashimi. We ordered like 3-4 other rolls but they didn't come for an hour so we ordered it again. Did not come. At one point, I had to ask the waitress out of curiosity if spider rolls were the only thing they had. She said yes, as a joke, but I did not know she was joking due to everything that had happened. They then brought a dragon roll which had a shit ton of cucumber and almost no unagi even though the waitress claimed cooking the unagi was what was taking 1.5 fucking hours. 

I suspect Sushi D is a farm-to-table establishment. In that, they must raise the eels and tuna in the back and slaughter them to order. I don't have any other ideas as to why it'd take so long to get an unagi roll that actually had 90% cucumber only anyway. 

After 2.5 hours, 6 spider rolls and about 80 pieces of anorexic salmon sashimi, we gave up. We didn't get 50% of the things we ordered. We suspect the sushi chefs did not know how to make the rolls. And we just wanted to call it a night. 

The guys in our group left hungry and we vow to never return until maybe they have sushi...and food other than spider rolls."
test_946,"Stopped by while in town visiting family.  Welcoming vibe and a top notch instructor.  Highly recommend for anyone looking to get in some rolls while in Charlotte, regardless of skill level."
test_947,"I wanted to start off my review by saying ""A hole in the wall - what a great find!"", but every restaurant in Boulder City seems like a hole in the wall... And not all of them are great finds... 

Le Bistro Cafe, which the sign actually says ""The Bistro Cafe"", is indeed a great find. It is so quaint and homey inside with an open kitchen. Once you are inside, you feel like you're at your favorite Italian Auntie's home. You just know you will have great food in your tummy tonight!

The server brought us our bread and drinks right away. The bread was nice and hot. It was baked with Italian seasoning and cheese on top. Yummy. We had a bottle of table wine - it was a blend of everything - recommended by the server. It was a good wine that everyone can enjoy with our food. 

We started off with the clams appetizer. It was broiled in a tomatoes red sauce. The clams were so big and fat - they were delicious! Must try it if you like seafood. 

I had the shrimps pomodoro. The shrimps were tiger shrimps - they were huge! And fresh!! The sauce was very light and was made with fresh tomatoes. It was all you can ask for in a shrimps pomodoro. There weren't really anything that I can complain about with my dish. 

One of my dining companion had the shrimps and scallops penne. I tried the scallops, and it was delicious!!! I love scallops, and I have eaten my share of scallops, but one thing I find is that most restaurants either overcook the scallops or undercook the scallops. Either way is a waste of a fresh scallop. Not at Le Bistro! The scallops were cooked just right, and the seasoning was perfect. Not too strong or too light - it complemented the penne and shrimps perfectly!

The boyfriend had the chicken parmesan. He liked it enough, but I thought it was delicious - yet again!!! The sauce was different from the typical parmesan. This sauce was light, which I prefer. The chicken was not too tough, and you can still taste the breading. Awesome dish, I thought. 

This has became one of my favorite restaurants. I really want to try everything on the menu now. My drive to this restaurant is about 30 minutes, and it is definitely worth the drive. 

Buon Appetito!"
test_948,"Well here goes another *1* star review!  How do I get into these places?  I LOVE Orange Julius and have been going to them since a very long long time ago.  If I am in a mall and see one, I always need to buy one and drink it while shopping...YUM!  Here in the food court at Aliante Station I found the Orange Julius stand mixed-in with Dairy Queen.  There were about 4 people in front of me and we were all just standing there when I spotted the sign on the counter which read ""back in 5 minutes"".  OK, everyone deserves a potty break.  But, this 5 minutes turned into 10, then 15, and I was dang hungry for their hot dog and orange drink.  Finally I gave-up and went down the row of fast foods available.  No, didn't want a taco, or Chinese food, or another hamburger, or pizza - dang, I just want that hot dog and drink!  I went back to OJ and stood for another few minutes when finally the ""crew"" came laughing back in.  Who knows where they had been.  Oh, boy, I'm close to getting my hot dog and drink!  The people in front of me ordered and finally it was my turn!  I looked at the girl taking the orders and said, ""I would like a hot dog, w/mustard and relish, and a medium Orange Julius.""  ""We are out of hot dogs."" was the reply.  You have got to be kidding!  But she was going to make my Orange Julius, and one for my husband.  I couldn't wait until she handed it to me and said, ""That will be $10.36.""  $10.36!  Are you kidding me.  With a very straight face she just said, ""No.""  $10.36 for 2 medium Orange Julius'!  So pick me up off the ground!!  Will I go back?  Are you kidding?  I went to Johnny Rockets and got myself a very good hot dog, and savored every sip of the most expensive Orange Julius I have ever had.....Actually it really wasn't that good........."
test_949,"Service is eh, but their Nutella ice cream sandwich is exceptional! Would go back just for that!"
test_950,"Im a Packers fan. This is a Seahawks bar. But it's just so awesome. Big E and Rich are the best. I was sad to see Chris leave but family first. The new girl Gretchen is great and so is Eric. Always a good time at Scooters. Darts, pool, shuffle board and arcade games. AND if you didn't know the food is great. The Cook Nacho is like a 5 star Chef out of Beverly hills. I love the apps and especially the Cajun Penne Pasta. Fat shrimp and Anduie sausage. They even have touch tunes for you to play your own music. For someone that's in the service industry this is my bar. Nothing but a good time after work."
test_951,"My experience was similar to Christi's below. We popped over to Free Range Brewing to try Joe's Doughs and Hiya was out front. I ordered the Bulgogi bowl. I was picturing rice topped with slices of thin beef in a sweet sauce. Crisp and savory meat with a sweet sauce to mop up with rice. I was thinking way ahead of myself. Instead I got clumpy, over cooked rice with chopped meat topped with lettuce drizzled with spicy mayo and a couple pieces of fluorescent pickled something. There were also cellophane rice noodles on one side...? Not at all what I expected. $9 - price isn't bad but the execution wasn't there."
test_952,"This place gets a 4 automatically from just walking in! I love the atmosphere and the art decor. It reminds me of my university cafe. The food was simple and delicious. I recommend this place for sure! I got the pancakes, a bagel with an egg, and bacon. The bagels are really soft which I love!!! I will definitely be back"
test_953,"I didn't think another club could come around that could compete with XS, but Surrender is amazing.  The main room is small, but it's nice, and the outside pool area is ridiculous!  A round of Red Bull and vodka is going to set you back $40- but who give's a F@#!- it's Vegas!  PS-  Surrender probably has the best Go-Go dancers I've seen at any of the clubs."
test_954,"The location is the only thing that's great about it. They have rude and poor customer service. It's also pricey. The ""fresh"" produce which is often old and moldy. And the hand selected stuff you get from the ""back"" be careful for that too! You must spend $10 to use your card too. I try to avoid going here."
test_955,"I'm no alcohol snob- but I know a good cocktail when I've had one. This place boasts a classy upscale vibe, but you really can't judge a book by its cover. My fianc√© and I stopped in here just to see what the fuss was about during a recent trip to Vegas. The place is clearly relatively new and shows no signs of wear thus far. There is plenty of seating including table areas, couches, and chairs. The seating is well-spaced which allows patrons to keep conversations to themselves. But the evening we arrived the music was so loud that it caused all of the customers to yell over one another- and it just made the entire atmosphere really ... uncomfortable. We ended up only staying for one drink largely due to the fact that it was ridiculously loud and impossible to just sit and enjoy one another's company. 

We found a menu on the table in front of us and drifted through drink options. It was a busy night that night, but I also think this place was understaffed. The waiter working diligently around us was the only waiter we could find- and we patiently waited for her to approach us. It took about 15 minutes from the moment we sat down for us to even be greeted. When we were greeted the waiter simply offered a quick hello and ran away with our drink order. She arrived back about 10 minutes later with our cocktails (a Grasshopper for me and a Manhattan for my fianc√©). 

I guess, for Vegas- in the Venetian- in a 'new and cool bar' we went in with too high of hopes for our cocktails. They were just... ordinary. Nothing unique, nothing special, and nothing particularly good. They were strong; yes, so I suppose if your intent is to feel the alcohol you're sipping- you'll do that here. But if you want to experience a unique and different flavor, this place isn't offering it. It's very traditional and the recipes they stick to seem to be the oldies but goodies. With that being said, that's not what we want to pay such a hefty price tag for. I can spend half of the cost of a 'normal' cocktail elsewhere. I wanted something different- something I'd remember.

Quite honestly, there was nothing about this place worth remembering. I was drifting through the places I'd ""checked in"" at, on Yelp, throughout my time in Vegas and when I saw The Dorsey I couldn't even remember where it was. I had to find which hotel it was located in, and look at pictures, before it jogged my memory. That's how bland and forgettable this place was. It wasn't worth the price and I really feel I could have gotten the same experience at the hotel bar in some of the smaller Vegas resorts. 

Sure, if you're in the Venetian and want a drink that you know will be served in a traditional manner- The Dorsey would make a great option. But if you want to spend a high dollar price on a unique cocktail, skip this place. They could also make the atmosphere much more intimate if they'd turn the music down. A few extra staff members serving customers would up their rating a bit as well. As for now, a very mediocre 3 stars is what they've earned from me."
test_956,I'm so grateful for the great care my dog Roxy received at Palm Valley Animal Clinic. She became ill on a Saturday morning and I could not get her in to her usual vet as they didn't have any openings. Palm Valley (although they usually cannot accommodate new patients on Saturdays) was willing to make an exception. I cannot express how thankful I was as Roxy was in quite a bit of pain. Dr. Hatch was caring and thorough. Roxy received the meds she needed and I even got a follow up call a few hours later by Dr. Hatch to see how she was doing (after the clinic was closed!). Thank you for the great care. I plan to use Palm Valley from now on for both of my pups' veterinary needs.
test_957,"Casey and Raul came out to clean the air ducts in my mother's townhouse. We connected with them via ""Thumbtack"". Casey was very exact with his bid and was first to respond on the Thumbtack site. When they got to the house, we discovered that the air coil was also very dirty as were the air registers. We switched to a different package which caused Casey and Raul to spend most of the day on the job. They were very thorough and we are super glad they called the air coil issue to our attention as it will increase the efficiency and life of the unit. I highly recommend Wise-ventz and this will be the company I use for any of this kind of work in the future."
test_958,"This is the first place I went to for my first tattoo and I here now with my husband getting his first tattoo and my fourth. 
The people here are super friendly, will give a reasonable price, and the artist do a damn good job! I will always come back here to get my tattoos. I get my tattoos done by Daniel. You can also get piercings that is done by a professional piercer. They give you water as well to stay hydrated. 
Come get your tattoos done by Brother's Keepers!"
test_959,"Maybe I'm spoiled, but my stay at the Venetian is somewhat disappointing. I booked the Bella suite for my husband's belated father's day gift and while the room was beautiful, upon close inspection the room is not as clean as I would hope especially with the amount of money I paid plus resort fees. My kiddos found potato chips crumbs, and I wanted to let it slide thinking it could be one off thing. The tub has some glitters and I found blonde hair in the shower. 

But guess what the next day after all day activities, my room was made up but the crumbs still there, seriously??! So they decided to skip vacuuming-how gross can it be. How long have they been doing that you wonder. And what else that they don't clean. 

To be fair, I'm pretty picky. Even $700 a night Bellagio was disappointing to me. For as long as I paid premium for any service I expect it to be somewhat impeccable. The 2 elevators access and long walk didn't even bother me but giving me half a$& service while charging exorbitant amount bothers me big time.

I'm sure this doesn't apply to all rooms, but whoever did my floor (level 12) the housekeeper(s) are sucks!"
test_960,"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. 
The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.
Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after."
test_961,"You've really got be a fan, an enthusiastic and tolerant fan of loud 89s style rock music to enjoy this show. Many in the audience were, just not me. 
Go to Absinthe. Or go anywhere else."
test_962,"Whenever  I visit Las vegas, this is the place I must stop by. 

I like their breakfast and dinner both. Service is great and foods are always very delicious. Never disappointed."
test_963,"Had a Pizza yesterday,not the same quality and delivery service extremely rude.Will do my business with Dominoes or a frozen pizza from supermarket and avoid this place forever."
test_964,"Average food.

Had the Pastrami with extra meat... had me wondering what exactly was the ""regular"" portion after I got it as it was hardly ""extra"". The ""melted"" cheese was just a hard slice of what seemed like Swiss... or American... couldn't really tell.

I then made the mistake of adding some Cholula hot sauce sitting on the table but the sauce was stale.. ruined what was already an average sandwich.

Props for using Boars head meats but probably won't be back."
test_965,"Our new go-to pizza place! Tasty, great service, unpretentious, amazing value. The wings are perfect - just what you'd want. Pizza is incredible - thin crust, good sauce, wide topping selection. But the best part? The freaking ranch. Honestly, one of the best ranch dressings I've ever had. If you're a fellow ranch head, you know he importance and plight of finding the right one. 

11/10 will be back again."
test_966,"This is my new spot! Followed Alyssa from another place because she's amazing at what she does. I'm not disappointed at all! The Black Comb is comfortable, local and perfectly priced. I don't get my nails done so I cannot offer any reviews on that. Give this place a try.....you may never go anywhere else."
test_967,The sign says best cheese steak in the world. Probably pretty close but definitely best in the valley. The service is great every time. Food is fast and fresh and delicious every time. I've been passing this places information around daily since I found it!
test_968,"Really pretty lame. 

Their food has no flavor. Their salsa has no flavor or spice at all. 

Super disappointing."
test_969,"My husband & I tried this place for the first time today and we were both highly impressed and loved absolutely everything we had!  My husband raved about the bold coffee and flipped for his eggs Benedict (which is is all-time favorite breakfast).  My eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon crisp, wonderful sourdough toast & the seasoning on the potatoes was just so yummy.  We will definitely be going back to try other things.  Great little place in Rock Hill & definitely worth the try!"
test_970,Absolutely amazing! From the moment I walked into the door for my consultation to my post op appointments they have been awesome! My mommy makeover results are fabulous and I'm only a few weeks post op. I am constantly getting compliments on how good I look already and Minot even close to being completely healed yet! highly recommend them to everyone!
test_971,"Checked into Rumor after a long day of traveling and all I wanted was to enjoy the comfort of a nice, clean bed. I pulled back the sheets and noticed they weren't clean. OK, no biggie I'll call to have it changed and go out for dinner in the meantime. We come back full and even more exhausted to have the same sheets on the bed and all that was done was another pair of sheets left on the coffee table.. Great. I made my own bed. The decor was modern but basic, and the little details like the wall hooks in the bathroom, one still there, one ripped out with only holes in the wall remaining. The entry gate we were shown on the map let us straight to our hotel, yet it was broken so we had to carry our luggage down another route. I'm simple, and could over look the wall hooks and the broken entry door, but the sheets..."
test_972,Decent pizza. The crust was kind of bland but the cheese and sauce are great. The large is actually more of a medium.
test_973,Way too expensive!  We just ordered Papaya salad and 2 orders or sticky rice with mango and it came to $33.00?????!!!!!
test_974,Probably one of the best massages I've ever had. Everyone was very professional. The facility is very clean and the atmosphere is relaxing. I asked Tricia to work my lover back since I'm training for a marathon and she did a superb job! I cannot wait to book our my next appointment.
test_975,Amazing sushi and great prices. The waitresses on the other hand could use some work. For instance stand around talking to each other when you have asked for water twice. Had to track one down to get my check. I think she was expecting a tip Cuz I had to actually ask for my change. Ha!
test_976,Matt is detailed and knowledgeable and provides a great service. We've put him on our calendar to do our annual vent cleaning.
test_977,I've been here multiple times. The food is amazing. I get the grilled veggie wrap and a soup. Every soup I've had is delicious.    I've never been disappointed.  The service is great.  They are quick and friendly.  And it's a good deal too. Less than $20 to fill your belly and maybe even take some home for later.  I give 5 out of 5.
test_978,"First the good news, there were plenty of newspapers to read.

Now that I got that out of the way, let's have a look at why I gave it one star; it would have been zero, if that had been an option.

My wife and I ordered the exact same thing, the Tom & Jerry breakfast (2 eggs, 4 strips of bacon, 4 sausages, and choice of toast). I'll chalk the one star up to the eggs having been cooked correctly (mine over-easy, my wife scrambled). However, it was clear that the time between us placing our order and how long it took for the plates to be placed in front of us that the bacon and sausage had either been cooked hours earlier and were reheated or were microwaved in the time it took for the eggs to cook.

The bacon and the sausages were so oily and were clearly just sitting in their own oils while waiting to be ordered. They were lukewarm at best. I don't mind if my bacon is not crispy, but there was nothing crispy about this bacon. The ""cooked"" sausage looked exactly like it had come out of the wrapper and was barely warm, but  for what its worth, it was cooked. The toast must have had half a pound of butter on it. The butter was literally oozing out of the bread, that I was worried if I ate it, my arteries would clog up within seconds.

I understand that the ""chef""  may want to get ahead of any potential rush, but come on, cooking eggs, bacon, and sausages does not take that long. On top of that there were only two other tables being used (Wednesday morning at 8:30am).  When I went up to pay, I looked over at the grill and sure enough, the bacon and sausages were lined up side by side, sitting in their grease, and ready to be re-heated.

I have been to other breakfast places and even a Tutti Fruitti in Chateauguay and this place was by far the worst breakfast place I have ever been to. Not only would I recommend not going to this restaurant, I would recommend skipping a meal before I would even think of going in here."
test_979,"Extended family and I have been using David's services for over 15 years and he's always reliable, prompt, and provides great service."
test_980,"Really good food, shrimp fajitas and Carne as ada were delicious! Service was great. Only complaint is its super smokey inside and the smell stays in/on your clothes and hair, they need better ventilation."
test_981,"I haven't been to The Flats in thirty-five years. Thirsty Dog brought us back. 

We traveled from Toledo to meet the in-laws for lunch. We don't get a lot of Thirsty Dog in Toledo, but they have a great reputation. 

Their beer is great. The restaurant had maybe 30 to choose from. Especially like the stouts and porters. Food was also very good. I had the kielbasa and pierogis. My wife had the meatloaf. We had pretzels as an appetizer. Which is a must. Apple fritter for dessert. Which was decent."
test_982,"Signed up during the first week of the rewards program and that was close to my birthday. My birthday credit was never loaded into my account/no email either... so I had a manager, Kristin/Kristen help me. She saw that my movie was about to start so asked me to come to guest services after the movie was over and look for her. I really appreciated that and more so, for her looking into my account for me. It wasn't a quick fix so thank you, Kristin for your help! On top of their excellent customer service, the cine capri was awesome, comfy and clean! It's been awhile since I've been to this location but I will certainly consider going back after that great experience. Thanks!"
test_983,"It was my first time at Frilly Lilly and my first time at a salon in Calgary. I came from Ottawa where I had one esthetician of choice so I was nervous for something new. But the girls there made it a wonderful experience,

Felicia was who I had my appointment with and she was just wonderful. She made me feel welcome and relaxed and she is very skilled at what she does. I got the Brazilian wax, which is never pleasant, but I can say for sure she made the experience the best one that I've had. I recommend her to anyone.

Thank you Frilly Lilly for making a normally unpleasant experience very enjoyable!"
test_984,"Great deal great meal! Had Groupon and was pleasantly surprised. Wie had a half Mama Leone and only ate 3/4 LOVED IT I had corned beef on rye and it was EXCELLENT LOTS OF MEAT
 Pickle spears very good. Not fancy but very good. Owner was there and tends to business.  I RECOMMEND"
test_985,"This place was great, then it sucked. Now it's great again. For low price food of better than low price quality I figure they're breaking even at best. They need the local trade to support the neighborhood market so after years of trade they found the sweet spot. It's five stars are not meant to imply an equivalence with the best restaurants but in comparison with its peers like Arizona Charles, Suncoast, the Palms and the Cannery. The food is really good enough to eat and you can still get the iconic buffet dessert-lemon meringue pie. It always takes some discipline not to over eat and be gluttonous only with thine eyes. There is enough fresh food and non- fried entries to be good on the salad and meal so you can be a little bad on the sweets."
test_986,"I took my wife and two kids here on a Friday night a few weeks ago for the first time.  A friend of mine recommended it to me.  I must say that guy gave some great advice.  We were planning on just ordering everyone a cone with a scoop or two but then we saw these awesome sundaes.  We ordered the Oreo Boat Sundae for the 4 of us to share.  To be fair the four us included a seven year old boy, my wife, my one and half year old daughter and me but the Oreo boat was more than enough to feed all of us.  So, big bang for your buck.  The ice cream was smooth and creamy and the toppings really hit the spot.  This a great little spot that has very friendly staff.  Has a great outside seating area with a playground that my kids really enjoyed.  We will be making frequent stops to the Carolina Cone.  Great place to take the family for a frozen treat."
test_987,"OK.... not worth a second trip. Fries are not crispy, very greasy. Burger has no taste and it is pretty small. Service is okay, nothing stellar. The bacon bites are good but unfortunately that's the only thing we liked it. The onion rings were not crispy, were more like raw onions with just a few breaded crust around it. It was completely uneatable. The crafty beer we ordered was also on the bad side. It was a waste of money to be quite frank... for what we spent here we would have got a MUCH better burger somewhere else. It was $40+ for a family of 4 (2 kids meals). The server asked me my opinion as I walked out and I told him I wasn't happy and he was like -- oh come'on ! -- Well, while I do understand his disappointment, perhaps it was better to listen to my comments..."
test_988,Need a hockey fix and Boston Pizza took care of it.  Each Friday a few of us link up and enjoy dinner at Boston Pizza.  The food is exceptional and the past two weeks our server Kim was awesome.  She kept the drinks flowing and food coming.  Boston Pizza truly understand customer service and what is takes to keep a customer happy and coming back for more.
test_989,"I want to start off by saying I had purchased my car from this dealership. They had the best price to offer out of the entire valley. 
I purchased my car from here in 2015 and been coming back to this dealership whether it's for an oil change or maintenance. This dealership is far for me. It's a 30 mile drive but I refuse to go to the Honda dealership in Scottsdale which is what is closer to me. I was treated poorly twice and this is when I had made a commitment to driving all the way to this dealership. 
Today, Kevin took care of me and let me start by how genuine and patient he was. He checked back with me consistently and explained what was going on with my car. My battery turned out to be dead and he replaced it for me. He worked it out to the same deal my dad had gotten from Honda. I am extremely satisfied with the service provided from this dealer and continue to do my business here. I want to say getting my car done today as any other day when I come here was fast and efficient. Thank you Arrowhead Honda for your beautiful service."
test_990,"Super cute macarons!! Loved the black sesame flavour and milk tea flavoured one best. Can't remember if it was the Roasted one or the HK style one I liked. It's because of its cuteness it got 4 stars... there's definitely the perfect crunch to chewy texture that I feel is missing here, but overall, can't resist the adorableness. A box of 9 makes for a wonderful gift for that special someone... or for yourself!!!"
test_991,Stopped by the Palms Hotel and to my surprise they have a movie theater inside. Looked very nice so we decided to watch a movie. They accept the MoviePass by the way for those that have it. Tickets were $6. All the seats are recliners. If your in town and looking to see a movie check this place out.
test_992,"A former colleague from New York was in town for one day with a group of Rotary exchange students and we planned to meet for lunch or dinner.  As it turned out, dinner was the better option so I started checking on Yelp for places in Henderson where the group was spending the night.  Il Chianti jumped out for its good reviews and I bookmarked the restaurant and I'm so glad I did.

I met my friend where the group was staying on Boulder Highway and Il Chianti was a mere mile and a half away.  Il Chianti is in a non-descript small strip mall that I've driven by many times on the freeway but never on the Horizon Ridge side.  We arrived close to eight and were seated promptly.  While looking at the menu, the chef/owner came by to welcome us to this small restaurant that was dimly lit.  

We were told two specials and then we both ordered the lobster ravioli with blackened shrimp, asparagus, in a tomato vodka sauce.  The shrimp were very good.  Some of the lobster flavor was overwhelmed by the sauce but the ravioli were good.  My friend isn't a fan of asparagus and there was no problem substituting a different vegetable for her.

For dessert, we shared an order of cannoli.  I asked our server if they were pre-filled or filled to order and she said they were filled to order.  They were very good.

Service was very good, the staff was very nice, and it turned out to be a good choice for dinner.  Yelp comes through yet again."
test_993,"Cousins took me to this all you can eat sushi buffet. It was remarkable! Everything was delicious, you can even get miso soup, they had spring rolls, along with making yourself a ginger salad to go with your meal. The variety of susgi they had was amazing, and their service was excellent! Would 100% go back. Plus the price was very reasonable!"
test_994,"I do not get what everyone is talking about; I am guessing all of these reviews are from young hipsters or pretentious middle age drones looking for some cool in their life. Let me start by saying that I enjoy what I call ""casual elegance."" I like good upscale food, in a modern, casual atmosphere, with a laid back nice, but down to earth vibe. Somewhere like SIX PENN Kitchen or something. I decided to come here after reading many great reviews on Yelp. This place is comical, trys wayy to hard!

It is very small, tables very close. Low ceiling/dark paint so it feels very claustrophobic. It does describe itself as a lounge so I will give them that; if you like swanky lounge vibe this place is actually pretty nice. Too dark and small for my liking. The waiter, dressed in his skinny jeans and pompadour brought over a bottle of tap water to pour. We politely decline b/c I didn't want water so why waste it..ya know. He seemed offended that I didn't want water, he offered us wine, and we declined, I just wanted a diet coke because I was on call for work and could not drink. He became aloof, almost took it as a personal assault that we didn't want wine!

I ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, ""Oh you want to share the appetizer"" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn't specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information. 

So we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had ""seared"" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I'd give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better. 

I think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance. 

Pass. There are plenty of good places in the Burgh that have excellent food, but are comfortable and laid back, but still elegant."
test_995,"Food was great large portions, just wish the menu had a little more variety of Mexican dishes. It was my first time there though so yeah. Staff was awesome professional & courteous. Definitely a family style restaurant with large amounts of seating available."
test_996,"I was excited to try Guy's spot when I was in Vegas, only to be very disappointed. I had a pulled pork sandwich and there was just nothing special about it. The fries were even mediocre. I was with 3 friends and they felt the same about their meals. For the price, I was thinking to myself, I'd rather be eating at a dive from his show. I think you can do much better in Vegas so save yourself the disappointment...."
test_997,"Okay, okay... It's not Gallo anymore.. I was heartbroken, too. 

I had my reservations about going here, due to the spotty reviews and everyone saying it just wasn't the same... 

It isn't the same.. However, it wasn't awful. The main thing I miss about Gallo was the shrimp and grits, and the fried cheese thing, but hey, I can burn cheese in a pan at home. So out with the old, and in with the new. 

Downside: The bar area with the black walls, DEPRESSING. Put some artwork up, it's a bar, not a funeral. Also, the bar tender could try to smile once in a while, if your job is that awful man, don't do it. 

Upside: The fish torta, my new favorite, and I really love the El Jefe, so grumpy pants bartending gets a few extra points because that drink is outstanding... 

So give Tranquilo a whirl!"
test_998,"Wow. This mall has REALLY gone downhill in a hurry.  First walking into the food court I noticed that out of 11 places that could hold dining options, only 5 places were there. Sarku Japan, Stir Fry 88, Steak Escape, Taco Bell and Kato's Cajun. My wife and I were planning on getting Steak Escape, however when I went to order I was told I could only use cash because their card reader was broken. So we opted to eat somewhere else outside of the mall. 

Walking around the mall I just got an uncomfortable vibe. I don't know how to explain it, but as a cop my ""spidy senses"" were going off.  There were a lot of 16-20 year old kids roaming around hanging out and shouting back and forth in the food court.

The main reason we came to the mall was to get my 5 year old daughter's ears pierced at the Piercing Pagoda. We got there and had to wait a little bit to be helped, no big deal. The ear piercing went fine, but I can tell you we will not be back to this mall until things change.

On the way out of the mall we basically got followed halfway down the mall buy some guy selling Sprint wireless. He started his sales pitch by saying ""I know you don't want to switch carriers...but"".... it only took me telling him three times that I didn't want what he was selling. We were literally 100 feet from his booth before he got the hint. I didn't come here to get pushed around by a salesman, if I wanted that I would go hang out at a used car sales lot."
test_999,"I've parked here a couple of times and both times were good.  The lot is secure, shuttles clean (although would have liked a little more frequent, but nothing bad) and service is good.  

My only (minor) complaint was during T-day weekend.  Pulled into the lot and they said they only had parallel parking available.  Other words, you double park and leave the keys in the car!  Had to do what needed to be done.  My car had been moved into a space nearby when I returned, but all was safe.  They said that if I had a reservation, I would have had a traditional space."
test_1000,"My girlfriend and I went to Sushisamba for a late lunch the other day.  I ordered the rio grande churrasco plate and a mojito from the bar.

The churrasco was very tasty and its a good portion.  It comes with 3 different types of meat, rice and beans with some greens and three variations of chimichuri.  

I would Definatly recommend eating at Sushisamba!"
test_1001,"The scene: An intimate 8 course chef's tasting menu at Heritage Food & Drink.  A long table full of my Yelp friends. Sparkling glasses of water, craft beer and wine on a crisp white table cloth. The interior of the restaurant is warm, understated and cozy.

The courses: Deviled Egg with Pimento Cheese, Tempura Whole Baby Turnips with Sweet Chili Sauce, Beet Tartar with Beet Sponge Cake, Florida Shrimp with Black Rice, Baby Bok Choy, and Shitake Mushrooms, Gulf Oyster with Black Eyed Peas, Ham and Hot Sauce, Duck Breast with Sunchoke Puree, Brussel Sprouts and Fig Glaze. 

Dessert courses: Chocolate Mousse Hybrid with powdered Peanut Butter, Chocolate Explosion Truffle layered with Powdered Cocoas.

 Every course was delicious, well thought out and executed. The plating was the really exciting part. Each dish was like a beautiful painting. The Tempura, Seafood and Dessert courses especially stood out for me.

Our servers: Incredible.  Genuine. Knowledgeable. Highly attentive. Friendly. The sheer number of plates and silverware they turned over was impressive.

The ingredients: Locally sourced. Seasonal. Utilized in both a functional, ""dish constructing"" way while simultaneously highlighting each ingredient's flavor. The results are complex synergistic dishes.

The Chef: Chef Paul is just plain great! He is passionate about his ingredients and transforming them in distinct ways. A real artist with some amazing molecular gastronomy techniques.

The finale: Smiles all around. Warm hugs, handshakes and goodbyes.

The summary:  Worth the trip to Waxhaw. The real deal. Five star food and service. Experience it for yourself!"
test_1002,"Excellent tacos, try the braised pineapple pork. Jessica is great! She's been our waitress twice now and we can't wait to come back."
test_1003,"Alex and his team painted two of my neighbor's houses across the street. He also approached me with a quote and explained the steps he would go through painting house exterior. I asked Alex to wait for a week and requested my landscaper trimmed plants back around the house. Alex and team did an amazing fast and detailed preparation and painting job. At final work-through, I liked the result and could only find 2 minor details that can be better. Alex said he would stop by later to fix them and he did  follow up within the same week. I would recommend working with Alex and company for a quality exterior paint job."
test_1004,This place is the most outstanding restaurant in surprise! The owner Dennis has done it right on so many levels! The food is so delicious and it never ever disappoints! Bring your whole family here!! You have to ask for Kathy or Steven to be your order! They're the OG's and know how to give you a great dining experience.
test_1005,"Thai Shan Inn is a great place to go.. my family has been going since I was young. The original owners are back and the owner, Louisa, is such a sweet woman. She gave us spring rolls on the house and she is so kind and thankful. The food is great, I recommend the Pad Thai. Definitely check this place out!"
test_1006,"Enjoy the ambiance and sharing plates, but be prepared to order a lot of plates!

Two menus are available: a tapas menu for the tapas/bar area, and an additional menu for the main dining area.  The dining area menu actually has a lot of small items as well.  Overall, the paella is the only self-contained entree , as you would definitely want to order additional plates even if you had one of the heartier choices. 


Grilled octopus was our favorite item; simply prepared, as it was grilled with a slice of lemon, but it was nicely tender.  Lamb sausage was also notable for white beans that were at the correct doneness.  Among the tapas we ordered, it was pleasant to order two dishes for which you could order more than one bite.

I do recommend asking the server exactly what each item entails prior to ordering. The charred beets was a crostini topped with cheese, beets, and a lemony pine nut paste.  From the menu, there is no indication that this is a crostini, so I expected a small plate of roasted beets. Asking the server is also important due to serving size--I understand that tapas are for sharing, but when I asked about the size of green beans (and other types of beans) w/ cream fraiche, the server indicated that it entailed of about 5-7 beans. Ouch.

Albondigas (a type of meatball), ambivalent, same with the croqueta de jam√≥n.  Padr√≥n peppers, a mildly spicy fresh pepper, stuffed with cheese and wrapped with ham--enjoyable, but not mindblowing.

To me, the patatas bravas tasted good, but not what I would expect.  Patatas bravas are typically chunks of potatoes but these were in an American thick french fry shape. To me it was essentially french fries with hot sauce and some aioli and parsley.

Raspberry ginger sangria was refreshing but I would have a tough time differentiating it from other sangrias.  A more knowledgeable person than I would be able to comment about the wine selection, although I did notice a lot of specific Spanish varietals, such as txakoli. The dining area does harken to a Spanish hacienda a little, considering the metalwork on the windows and you can see the jam√≥n ib√©rico and the plated tapas items ready to go behind glass.  The service and ambiance is gracious, but not fussy. You're on your own for parking, although the Ovation building sometimes has public parking for a fee.

Next time I go, I'll bring a group of friends and order the paella and a variety of dishes so we can have both the heartier paella and the small plates."
test_1007,"Not bad for American style sushi in the South Hills.  Beautiful presentation, took it home to enjoy. The restaurant was empty at 2 o'clock on a weekday Stopped in for some sushi. Told the owner to surprise me with three specialty rolls of his choice and also ordered a vegetable sushi roll. He ended up making me a Alaskan salmon and tuna with jalape√±o, An all cooked fried shrimp and crispy onion roll as well as a smoked salmon and shrimp roll.  The owner was very nice, and him but next time I think I will try to Korean food since he is Korean."
test_1008,Horrible service! Purchased on Groupon. The menu extremely over priced! Food was beyond mediocre! Lunch special has no specific days on menu! But don't allow it during the weekend even before 1pm. Nothing we order was good accept the spring rolls... & they were just ok... So lunch at 11:30am on a Saturday was 57$! Neverrrr again!
test_1009,"Love this shop! I hadn't been riding my bike in a while because it needed a serious tuneup, but the guys at Spin did a better job than I could have dreamed. They even adjusted the handlebars to make it easier to ride with my one bad elbow. Now I'm commuting to work at least half of each week and loving it. Thank you, Spin, for bringing my bike back to life!"
test_1010,"Los Dos Molinos has been a fiery oasis to me and my sister for nearly 20 years.  A trip to visit our parents in Mesa doesn't feel complete without eating there.  Dad always gripes that we could go to the one in Mesa, but this location is the only option for me.  It is one of the few places that I can get food that is satisfyingly spicy hot.  I love the funky atmosphere, and the margaritas are HUGE.  The carne adovada chimichanga with green chile is my current favorite.  I am headed to AZ tomorrow and am taking a shuttle directly to Los Dos Molinos from the airport.  I love it.  If the other reviews about the clientele are scaring you off, go there for lunch.  And get someone else to drive."
test_1011,"There are many places to get a burger in this city. This place ranks amongst the best of them. The decor is industrial chic with wood, metal, and glass everywhere. Really cool vibe to the place. The food compliments it perfectly. If you are a fan of red meat, you've found your Huckleberry. They also have a huge selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles, many from local breweries. I've been here more times than I've checked in and have never been disappointed. The fries are the tiny straw variety like you get at Steak-n-shake which is my only gripe. You have to grab a handful of them at once to really enjoy them. If they went to a beer-battered or steak variety, it would be a home run."
test_1012,"We've been here a few times with our kids (almost 8 year old and an 5 year old). Both truly enjoy this. Our oldest has autism, and the NASA, robot, and train exhibits really kept his attention. 

I recommend going during the weekdays, you are less likely to find this packed. There is quite a few camp trips to here going on it seems, but it is summertime as well.  

Do check out sport works while you are here! It's a ton of fun. My youngest loved the bungee trampoline, and since its included in the admission price, you won't have to spend $10+ at the mall to do this. They have a big operation game, a suspended bike you can ride, a hockey game, a pitching speed calculator, ect. It gets kids moving and having fun!

The food is reasonably priced, and quite delicious. We were expecting to fork out a lot for a meal, and were pleasantly surprised!  Even my picky son loved the food. You can eat indoors, or on the patio area, there's tables with umbrellas.

The gift shop has a lot of cool gadgets. The prices are not terrible. My youngest wished for more bug stuff, but there was a ton of different things in there. 

Parking is free if you are a member, if you arnt, its $5.

PA access card holders can get into the science center for $2 a person. The other museums in Pittsburgh are a $1 per person if you have the card."
test_1013,I've seen plenty of shows and concerts and this one was hands down THE best! J. Lo lives up to her show's name because she gave all she has!
test_1014,I love this place. I go in every two weeks or so. I've never been disappointed. He does a great job on my neck and shoulders.
test_1015,"If I could give them 12 stars, I would. This was the single most fantastic experience of my life. I was very apprehensive initially, because I couldn't tell if it was a gimmick or not, but as soon as we met our server, Anthony I knew it'd be a good time.

First and foremost, I think it's awesome that our server could tell we were nervous, and therefor tried to break the tension with comedy. He was actually one of my favorite parts of the night. I appreciate that they inquire about allergies, and went ahead and verified why derivations of my allergies were okay, if any. 

Walking in was terrifying, because you go from the light to nothingness. They cushion it with another room that's partially lit, but the absoluteness of darkness was jarring. 

Feeling around to try and discover what foods are what was so fun. Our server wouldn't tell us if we were right or not about what we were eating (except for once on accident) but that made it all the more fun when we got out to see what the menu is (sorry guys, no spoilers from me). They also change their menu every three months, so even though the website says they have sweet, savory, and spicy options, there's a new menu that is actually different now that's one menu for everyone (unless your allergens prevent it). 

I love that Anthony noticed when I didn't finish something because I didn't like it. And he was actually very worried that I wasn't going to get enough food and offered me more because I skipped a portion (it tasted fine, but I've some texture aversion issues and I couldn't get over the mouthfeel coupled with the fact that I had no clue what I was eating). 

You think the courses are too much, they're not. They're perfect! And a pallet cleanser comes in at the perfect time to change the pace. They did a really good job with this. You could sense the chemistry between the employees inside which was also enjoyable to listen to. PLUS, we got a special gift at the end! (I'm not sure if it always happens, or if it's because it's a holiday weekend)I will probably come here every time I visit Vegas just to see the new menu and have the experience again! 

Thanks so much guys!!!"
test_1016,"Don't let my tanned skin fool you, I am as Russian as they come. I have been eating authentic Russian cuisine for 29 years so I can speak with great confidence when I say that Yummy Russia will not disappoint. Yes the prices are a bit high, but in my opinion, how can one put a price on such a great taste of the mighty Russian Federation? One can not. So, that being said, I highly recommend this place to all, Russians and not. I personally really enjoyed the beef and pork meat perogies (or as we say Pelmeni), as well as the Olivie salad (which i could live off), the herring salad (aka Shuba), the red caviar, and their Napoleon cake was truly phenomenal. Some may say I am biased, but they don't know how picky I am with food, especially Russian food!"
test_1017,My fianc√® and I visited Elements for the first time today for  a couples massage and we had a wonderful experience. From making the appointment to our therapists (Julian and Naomi) we are 100% satisfied and will go back soon! Everyone is very friendly and professional and focus on keeping you relaxed from beginning to end. We highly recommend our local Elements massage!
test_1018,"I have been to two French Groceries since I moved to AZ.  This one and La Grande Orange.  Neither of them actually sell groceries!  I know for a FACT that grocery stores in Paris carry everything that we have in OUR grocery stores and more.  Oh well.  Just don't show up with your reusable bags expecting to do your weekly shopping.

I have only had desserts here but they were good and I very much want to try the dinner as well.  Their selection of wines is not as good as one would hope from a ""French Grocery.""  Prices are reasonable.  I would definitely go back!"
test_1019,"Going here again today to watch the football games. Hoping for a good experience like the first time we went. Giving 4 stars just because the mixed specialty drinks seem a little steeply prices, but comparable to places like culinary dropout."
test_1020,"This was the nicest, cleanest group of bikers that I have ever met.
The cars and bikes are amazing."
test_1021,"Love this place! As a cleaner, they have treated my sweaters, comforters, sleeping bags, shirts, jackets very nicely.

But many cleaners can do this. What makes this cleaner stand out is their great customer service. I only go there once a month at most, but the owners got to know me and they even remembered my travel plans we small talked. Amazing!

When you hand over the clothes, they don't just tell you when you can get them back. They ask you when you need them. I've never been in an urgent situation, but by asking this they showed that they care about their customers!"
test_1022,I HATE HATE this place with a passion. Their stupid rule about the rooftop is the most frustrating thing I've ever experienced. Oh and the food sucks!!!!!
test_1023,Belch. Not sure how these places have survived. Save yourself some cash and get Frys deli fried chicken.
test_1024,"Had lunch here the other day and it was ok. Not worth the $22 price tag, imo, but we had a comp, so for free it was fine.

I had high expectations because of reviews and the fact that it is Bellagio, so maybe I just expected too much. 

Break down:

Mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious, lol,

Salmon was good

Fried rice was very dried out (and we were there right at the start of lunch) 

Sliders were very rare

Potato salad had super strong mustard seed seasonings (not my thing)

Pizza was fine

Cheesecake desserts were yummy

Pumpkin pie was not

To me it didn't seem much better than a $10-$12 buffet, but you are paying twice that amount. I think Caesars buffet is a thousand times better and in the same price range. I wouldn't go again, unless it was a comp."
test_1025,Great middle eastern deli with several vegetarian choices.  Very inexpensive and extremely friends staff.  Baklava is a must.
test_1026,"Look at the photos.  Simply look at the photos.  Never again. Booked on Hotwire.  Arrived at PHX beautiful rental facility and line was 70 people deep  for Payless.  2+ hour wait to get to desk - you can't even make that up at the holidays.  Why. Why.  2 employees.  2 - with them taking breaks and lunch & chatty as can be with the appearance of a windfall of victims.  Stood in line 25 minutes and found Fox had cheaper cars and booked IN Line and on line.   That is why I use Hotwire.  Does not ask for a credit card - just reservation.  No wait at Fox.  No wait in any of the pictures for Alamo, Budget, Hertz, Sixt!  Walking out with my cheaper Fox car - 6 pissed off people asked ( 6 Payless clients ) what I did and let them know and they left the line as well to Fox and Sixt.  Absolute incompetence, lack of planning and waste everyone's time.  70 people x 2 hours over and the line just never got shorter according to the coffee bar worker.  The flight was shorter inclusive of TSA than the Payless perceived incompetence.   On my Foxy Way & Happy I did Payless at Fox for great service!!!!"
test_1027,"I absolutely loveeeee Paige!!!! She is amazing!! I have been stationed here for almost 4 years and finally found a stylist that can cut my hair!!! I just wanted long layers..not a chopped block, yes it was embarrassing! 

When I got my first hair cut last week with Paige, I told her I was active duty military and she said well your cut is free! I was astonished! A free hair cut esp. with long hair?!? Yep! She would not even let me tip her! So I made an appointment for my young son for today. Hands down the best haircut he has had! I absolutely love it on him. He loves it and gets compliments wherever we go!

Next time I go I'm bringing my stripper heals because that's the one thing I forgot to bring with me! Loved this and want to do it again!"
test_1029,"This was my first time dining at Fleming's & it will likely be my last. 

My gf ordered the special that night, filet mignon and spicy shrimp. I ordered the bone-in ribeye, mid-rare. We ordered many side dishes (grilled asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, chipotle mac & cheese) as well -- since it was our first visit we wanted to sample several items.  Her filet was cooked as asked, mid-rare, and the shrimp were nicely prepared. My steak, however, was another story. Admittedly, it was a fantastic cut of beef, but it was completely annihilated in the broiler. It was just a hair shy of well-done. I sent it back and our server (who was spectacular, by the way) promptly returned it to the kitchen. Within seconds, the Manager came over to apologize and admitted they had ""missed it by a longshot"" and immediately comped the steak & offered to re-fire all of our sides and bring them out with my new steak. I did not take him up on that as I didn't feel it was necessary. I continued to munch on the sides while waiting for my steak. When it arrived, it was noticeably different in appearance. It was much larger in diameter and much, much thinner. In fact, the rib bone had been cut in half lengthwise. By this time I was so full from eating the sides that I simply cut into the steak to check for temperature (more rare than medium-rare, but I was happier with that) and asked them to just box it up to take home. I wish I would have continued eating it. When I ate it the following day, it was one of the worst cuts of beef I have ever seen. Anywhere. Shameful for a ""prime"" steakhouse to serve something like that. There was so much connective tissue in this steak that it rendered it essentially inedible. The fat on it wasn't the delicious, marbled type in high quality ribeyes. It was the chewy, gristly kind on CHEAP cuts of meat. I can only assume that they have separate steaks for comped meals, which is ridiculous. I hope I'm wrong about that. I've had better at Texas Roadhouse. The sides were very good, but not enough to salvage the meal. You don't pay Prime Steakhouse prices just to get some decent asparagus. Meal AFTER the comped steak was still $100 and not worth even half that. Our server, Laura, was the only redeeming factor of the entire meal."
test_1030,"I don't often write reviews but I was so impressed with the service I received that I felt I must let others know.  Tom is a class act!  He is very professional, friendly and knowledgeable.  I had him appraise my antique ring and he noticed one of the diamonds were loose which he quickly brought to my attention.  He repaired it for me at no charge while I waited!  I found his appraisal fee to be very reasonable and I will definitely use his services again.  I highly recommend."
test_1031,"Plaka Taverna is now my favorite Greek restaurants in Madison. I openly admit that I don't know how many Greek restaurants are in Madison but this one is far better than any ""gyro stand"", ""gyro restaurant"" or Mediterranean food spot trying to sell 2nd rate Greek fare. I haven't had much luck finding a restaurant that serves quality Greek food (although I'm not Greek, my best childhood friends were Greek and the family owned a restaurant - I feel like I have ""expert"" training as a non-Greek identifying good Greek food...) and Plaka Taverna hit a home run with their lunch.

I ordered the Taverna Platter for lunch which was $8.00. Pork Souvlaki (2 skewers), falafel (2 patties), a stuffed grape leaf, grilled pita, rice, tomato slices, feta cheese and kalamata olives. There was a small dish of homemade tzatziki sauce in the middle (don't let my picture fool you - I ate the olives and some of the cheese prior to taking the picture). Good amount of food for the price!

The pork souvlaki was really good. Great flavors that I was hoping for and cooked perfectly. Moist and easy to pull off the skewer. Great portion size for lunch and the price tag. Definitely what I was hoping for!

As I have mentioned in some previous reviews, I love falafel. The falafel patties were really good portions and satisfied what I wanted. This isn't the best falafel I have ever had but it definitely is in the top 15% of falafel I have tasted. One thing to point out is how fresh it was!

The other ""accourtrements"" (stuffed grape leaf, olives, tomato, pita and rice) were good. Nothing here that is going to wow you or make you want to come back specifically for but good enough to leave a positive impression. The rice was cooked very well!

The feta cheese was very good. I'd like to have had a couple more pieces on the plate! I get it that this is an $8.00 platter so understood that the price tag might prevent it.

Their tzatziki sauce is glorious. I wanted more - much more! Thick, flavorful, rich and fresh. This exceeds expectations in an extremely positive way. It may seem weird to highlight the sauce but it is highlight worthy! If you're a tzatziki fan you will LOVE this sauce!

My only two suggestions are minimal. I would have loved some olive oil on the plate somewhere (personal preference - it doesn't detract from the food) and they need to rotate in some new plates and remove the broken ones. I had a few decent sized chips in my plate. Absolutely nothing that impacts the food but one of those ""attention to the details"" things...

The interior of Plaka Taverna is fantastic. Clean and inviting. It definitely delivers a message that you are going to eat Greek food! The whole vibe is friendly and the service was top notch. The bar area looked like a great little spot to share that is probably way underutilized during evenings. At lunch (it was busy) we were checked on at least 3 times and had our drinks refilled each time. Food was prepared very quickly and we were in and out in under an hour. 

Plaka Taverna is a great Greek restaurant that delivers great food and great service in a great environment. I'll be back to try just about everything on the menu and definitely take up the suggestions to try their breakfast. If you're a fan of Greek or Mediterranean food I think you'll be happy with what you find here!"
test_1032,"Went to Bearden's today with a friend. It was probably the first time i had been here in over 6 years or so. As some of you may know this whole part of Lake Rd. was completely screwed by slow construction for what seemed like a number of years. Times must have been rough for business seeing as it was almost completely inaccessible for the most part. Bearden's seemed to take a hit and even closed down for a while. I can confirm that it is open and it's also been remodeled. 

As you pull in you will notice the fully revamped Bearden's illuminated sign. The old one was iconic and classic looking - a zone that had been tested by time and succeeded. The new sign has the same classic boldness with a bit more color and sports a sharp appearance. The parking lot seemed a little bigger as well. As you approach the entrance, you will notice a Ford Mustang cemented into the wall. It looks pretty cool actually.

You enter down a small hallway and roll right up to the counter. You will notice some menu's posted along the wall with letters from Bearden's fans.  A dedicated tribe indeed. You now order at the counter and take a number. A cup for a beverage is provided and you can have at the fountain all you want. The menu is standard if you know how Bearden's is set up; classic steakburgers, milkshakes, fries, onion rings etc etc. It's basically like a mom and pop styled Steak N' Shake with a style all it's own. I ordered a Bearden's Double Steakburger and an order of fries. With a drink out the door we're talking $11.99. It's steep. 

I sat down with my pal at a booth and checked out the scene. Everything is a bright white color with sea foam green interior. It's much, much different than the old 70's styled Bearden's we all remember and love. The same train I think they always used to have was on and circling the perimeter. Classic style! It was sad to be in there when it got dumpy to see the old train even broken down. Maybe it was a sign of their situation. 

Our food was delivered and it was EXACTLY the same as it always was. I consider this to be a good thing. A lot of people don't like when places like this change. If the food takes a twist (re: Sweet Melissa's, which will never live up to Max's Deli, just down the road) there is a good chance you will offend your loyal following for life. The fries were pretty good, not incredible. The burger was actually better than i remember it being. 

If you're going to Bearden's and you're a vegetarian or something, you might be in a bit of a bind. This is the fried food zone to the max, not much in the way of healthy eating here. But for the most part, Bearden's is a local staple people have come to love and enjoy - there is an element of nostalgia that is directly tied to the atmosphere of the restaurant. If you didn't rock Bearden's as a kid and you're just passing through town and stop here, it might be easy to misunderstand what this place is all about. 

I was thinking of giving it a 3 star review, just because of the bitterness of the renovation and the intense aqua overdose in the decor, but those are personal feelings that don't make sense in the larger picture of running a business and the upkeep that comes with it. It's the nostalgia and the effort to keep things classic at the end of the day that I appreciated. They had these cool bear shaped ketchup and mustard bottles that will surely stick in the mind of a new youngster for years to come. That's the vibe that Bearden's seems to have always rocked well. Besides that, the food was as good as ever. You're coming in for a steakburger and fries, how bad can it really get??

It's a diner in a small town, if you come here expecting gourmet food, hang back. If you haven't had Bearden's in a while, come by and check it out because it's worth the time."
test_1033,"Terrible food! Terrible!!! Over priced diner food. Dry, chewy, garbage. Super suburban restaurant that tries to be silly and fun but it's just generic and terrible. If I had 20 thumbs they'd all be down."
test_1034,"Not great ... I guess Glendale is new to the food fest experience, so I'm trying to go easy on them.  This was a bit of a mess for lack of a better description.  A group of Elite Yelpers were invited to participate with 10 samples.  We would be given 10 tickets to sample foods and give our opinion on the festival, and vote for our favorite vendor.  Here's my experience on the 2 hours I spent not eating at the food fest:

The Yelp portion was poorly executed.  We were told to be there by 11:45, but no one addressed us until a few minutes past noon.  Then we had to walk all 50 of us across the festival to get our tickets (near where we checked in earlier), then back to the starting point... THEN we were allowed to go back and start sampling.  Then we discover a lot of vendors had no samples/were out of food.  At noon!  Some vendors were selling full size items for cash, and giving samples for tickets ... Some were just selling full size food items... Some were just doing samples.  It was confusing and annoying.  

The ""express"" lines were just as long as the non-express lines for food.  And the Yelp group was instructed to just walk to the front of the line (no matter how many ppl were waiting) and ask for our sample.  Ugh.  Talk about making Yelp look bad! Most of us were so uncomfortable, we didn't even use our tickets.  That combined with the fact that a number of places weren't taking tickets. 

There were at least 4 vendors listed on the website that were not at the festival... I went because they advertised vegetarian and vegan.  What I found was a LOT of barbecue and no vegan. 

The water/soda station didn't have beverages when we were first there (11am - noon), they got supplies, but then they were out by 1pm when I went back by the tent.  I used my last 5 tickets for a full size coffee with sorbetto at Lulu's.  The coffee and coconut sorbetto was awesome.  Then I left.  

I would not go back to this food festival unless they adopted a better format and layout.  Put vendors not participating in tickets together on one side of the event, and those with samples together on the other.  Vendors need enough food to feed people past noon.  And you need a LOT more non-alcoholic beverages available."
test_1035,"This place is absolutely amazing! We have a shih tzu that has had horrible experiences at groomers before and now exhibits fear aggression with grooming. The owner was extremely understanding and recommended for us to see our vet to get our dog some anti anxiety medication and to bring him back. They alway get him in first thing in the morning and take such good care of him. They get him in and out in about 2 hours and he is alway so happy afterwards. We have 2 other husky poodle puppies and they will take all 3 of our dogs at once and they always look and smell great afterwards. The staff is always friendly, the place is always clean and the dogs get to play while they wait to be picked up! Prices are completely reasonable and discounts are available!"
test_1036,"Vive is pretty much everything you could ask for in a facility. It's clean, has a good range of equipment available, and makes very good usage of the relatively small space it occupies. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the other members are respectful. The 24h access is also a huge plus for me, being someone who has an unpredictable work schedule. The price of $50 a month is fair, especially with free classes and other benefits being included.

The only downsides to this gym are a product of it being a relatively small space: there aren't any proper changing rooms (instead there are 4 private stalls you can change in - two bathrooms and two shower rooms), so the lineups can take a little while during busy times. The same goes for locker space - it is limited, and during busy hours sometimes there is not locker available so I've had to leave my stuff sitting on top unsecured. However, this isn't very much of a problem, since the security in the gym is very good, the members trustworthy, and it's pretty easy to always be in view of the lockers while working out.

All in all, this is a great gym. Highly recommend!"
test_1037,"Reading the previous posts.. i was eager to give this place a try. Upon walking into the place. I knew it was going to be painfully bad. There was much variety but the amount of food place out for each was minimal. Seafood was not fresh and it was warm. Greasy... food, tables, plates, glass. Taste wise.. only thing that was good was the fruits.

If you want to still think Tokyo Sushi Buffet is the best quality with enough variety to make it the best AYCE sushi place in Pittsburgh."
test_1038,This is my second post for this Place  has been far and in between  since  last time  their    had the same waitress who  is  so  rude and  she so lacks  being what a good waitress should be   she so lacked on  getting things  when we asked for them   i asked for  well done bacon  when she brought it to me i said  can i have it a little more cooked  when she brough it back the second time    she  said  is it BURNED enough for you     i had to ask for surypt  for my waffle  she  brought one r very sticky  bottle  and slamed it down on napkin holder    seats were didry when we went to sit down  husband had to clean them off   she never said anything   and at end when  we were paying bill she was over at other end cutting something up  and she had no gloves on   she came over took out  money  and went right back to cutting what ever she was cutting   so sick so gross  My husband  said we will never be back  this is girl is the same one  i yelped the last time we came here for  some of the same reasons   and also cussing  on phone  i cant believng she still their    guess WH dosent really care  we were their on 9/26 at 315 in afternoon  check the schedule    :(
test_1039,"I let my fianc√© borrow my truck and she ended up side swiping some orange barriers on the highway. Now I am the biggest uptight person when it comes to my cars/trucks. Me and my brother use to own a body and collision shop in Detroit so I know what to expect and what to look for in a shop. When I walked into Las Vegas collision I was impressed. The manager came out and introduced himself looked at the damage and we got to talking he took me into the shop showed me his setup the (best of the best) of everything so I knew I was in good hands. Set my appointment,showed up next day to pick it up and the truck looked flawless. No cut corners or cost, fully detailed too!!!! Pure professionalism out of Las Vegas collision. The team over here is the real deal. Accidents happen but I know exactly where I'm going when it does. Thank you to everyone at Las Vegas collision!!!"
test_1040,Slow service with quite possibly the smallest water glasses ever. Burger was $22 and over cooked.
test_1041,"Please do not misunderstand me.  I enjoy waxed men pantomiming sexy-man archetypes as much as your average gay man.  

Actually, that's not true.  I do like a man in uniform, and I like them naked too.  It's just that, well, let's break it down.  6 women, $44 tickets.  That's $264 and all we got to see was some waxed & oiled ass and some poorly coordinated dancing.  Think about how much naked man $264 buys on the street.  

I did appreciate that some of the guys looked like they were possibly interested in sleeping with women, and that some of them did really cool flips across the stage!  

None of them individually stood out as bad dancers but unfortunately they had some real difficulties coordinating their movements the night we were in attendance.  I say unfortunate, but I'm not sure I would have had a better time were they more fluid.  I might have had a better time were the music and lights not so offensive to my ears and eyes.

I did learn a few things about myself, though:

1) I do not care for nipple piercings on dancing men.  Nipples should not flop around.  

2) I do not find the Village People, or Village People impressions, erotic.  I am apparently not open-minded enough to appreciate hairless men in costume as sexual beings.

3) If women with penis crowns are in attendance, I should not be."
test_1042,"Great dogs, great drinks, great people! 
We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of:
Jumbo Dogs,
Mini Dogs,
Spicy Dogs,
Polish Sausages
and Brawts!
All of it are great! 
They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers. 
Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer."
test_1043,"We stayed at the Plaza for a four day weekend getaway.  The first morning there I had Huevos Rancheros with green chile.  It was last meal good.  It featured two blue corn tortillas, two eggs over easy, pinto beans, and hash browns.  The meal kept me full for the entire afternoon until dinner.  
I must admit that breakfast is the highlight of this restaurant and is why my score is so high. 

For dinner I had a chicken taco plate. This featured three chicken tacos in hard shelled blue corn tortillas.  The meal was like cardboard. Just edible. 

The third night I had a veggie burger with green chili cheese fries. The veggie burger was a rice-veggie loaf kind of burger but was quite good actually. The fries were batter dipped and were covered in gooey cheese and green chili sauce.  Over all the meal was essentially good bar food. 

Overall the quality is uneven, but I will definitely be back for a stellar breakfast."
test_1044,"HIGHLY recommend this wonderful restaurant. I have been going here for years and have always had an incredible meal. It has been about a year since I was here last, and just went this past Friday. Superb food, creative and fresh. Service by Doug was impeccable. What  a fine gentleman. The cappuccino tort was phenomenal!
Keep up the good work.....you are appreciated!"
test_1045,"Found this place through Yelp. Great vibe and also nice for small groups. It has private parking behind the building which is quite convenient. We ordered beef tatami, Shisho tofu, boom shrooms, karaage and street roll. Boom shrooms is a must have, assorted mushroom topped with bonito flakes, mixed with soft egg. Love it! If you are a huge fan for fried chicken, don't miss the karaage, golden crispy skin with a tender and tasty chicken thigh inside, Yummy Yummy Yummy! Overall it's a nice experience."
test_1046,I ordered pick up and originally the girl on the phone was so rude but when I was greeted by Jojo she made the whole visit AWESOME great customer service!
test_1047,"More than happy, friggin stuffed. Gunner is incredible..... Food was great, now to finish my ........"
test_1048,Great meat! Great Salsa! Great Chips! Great Guacamole! Great Location! that pretty much sums it up. I love going here during Happy Hour and sitting at the bar. The bartender actually will serve you which is pretty perfect!
test_1049,"My wife and I went into the Bagel Cafe on Wednesday June 7. The food was OUTSTANDING and the service provided by Katie Ann was superb. We ordered from the daily specials board and selected eggplant parmesan (only $13.99). This meal came with soup or salad, the entree, a beverage and dessert. To say that the portions were huge would be a gross understatement. I had a very difficult time finishing my meal. You can feed two people with all of the food you get with the meal. We live in the neighborhood of the Bagel Cafe and had been lax in going into there to dine. That will not be the case anymore. The Bagel Cafe is now our ""Go To"" place when we want to dine well for a VERY reasonable price. I HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone."
test_1050,Geremy and Scott are a great team and did a thorough job. Keep up the great work!
test_1051,"I was enjoying my day until I walked in to this store. Initially, everyone was nice and helpful. However, it led into feeling like I was being harassed into making purchases. Every 5 seconds there was someone in my face talking or ""trying to help me"" when I was trying to process a decision on the items I wanted. The manager of this store needs to train the employees to know when to leave people alone to make purchase decisions vs. feeling like they have to buy something. I wanted to purchase multiple items but never had a free moment to feel want I wanted to buy. If you want peace and quiet while trying to decide buy online or go to another store."
test_1052,"THIS ADDRESS IS WRONG!!! GO ONLINE TO FIND IT ;) otherwise I absolutely LOVE Ben and jerrys; I recommend cookie dough, the tonight dough and milk and cookies :) the location is good, just search on the Ben and jerrys website for nearby scoop shops, and you'll find one close to this address. This address takes you to a neighborhood 15 minutes away ;)"

test_1054,"In need of an amazing massage? Have knots the size of baseballs? Don't care about ambience or decor? Want to walk out feeling good and revitalized?

Look no further than Tokyo Shiatsu Clinic aka Suzuki Shiatsu at The Beaches/The Beach. It's a one-room clinic with massage tables. There are no barriers or dividers so when you get a massage it's in full view of everyone else. It's a good thing you keep your clothes on, huh? There are several massage therapists (mostly Japanese) that have differing levels of English fluency but are so OMG-amazing at what they do. 

The only cons are you'll occasionally hear a fellow massagee snoring (yes they are that good) and the fact that they don't provide insurance receipts.

They take reservations and walk-ins and if/when you call and you get voicemail, leave a message and they'll promptly call you back."
test_1055,"Garden of Lights event was beautiful in the Chinese Garden but not as exciting in the other gardens especially at night when not much is visible. The indoor exhibits and greenhouse are great though, many many displays of what each plant is and additional information!"
test_1056,"I'd rate this a 3+.  Nice suite with two separate baths, lovely soaking tub (would have been much nicer with jets, but take a side trip to the Lush store in the Mandalay shops and get some nice bath bombs!), tvs in living room, bedroom and in the bathroom which was small but nice to watch while in the tub.  No separate pool and quite a haul to the Mandalay pools.  Check in service was really subpar.  Location at the very south end of the strip not particularly convenient (although they do have tram to Luxor and Excalibur).  I did enjoy the Bathhouse spa, which was small but nice and very peaceful and not crowded.  Spotty wifi (but free) and bad cell phone reception (but I'll blame AT&T for that one).  Nice enough hotel overall, but next time I'll be at the Encore."
test_1057,"This place is great! We are from California and love Lush so decided to check out Nectar. The products are adorable (albeit a bit on the pricier side)

The associate Vic was amazing and definitely made the experience one of a kind. She is the best!"
test_1058,"First, this is NOT a Mexican restaurant. Second, it is not Tex-Mex. It is their own version of what that means. Having had friends from Mexico (Chihuahua) who owned a Mexican restaurant, this food is not consistent with my normal experience with Mexican food in the USA or Mexico.

For example the red sauce has ground BEEF in it. If I order a Chicken product, I really do NOT want beef on it. They call this red sauce their 'gravy.' I asked for just a plain red sauce instead, expecting a red taco sauce, and what they put on the food was not a red chili sauce, it was more orange and not spicy or flavorful in anyway.

The chicken was not breast meat. It was the cheaper thigh and leg dark meat. They have Filet Minion on the menu, but they give you cheap chicken parts for the chicken meals.

You could order the shredded chicken. A fellow dinner did order that and it was just a plain shredded chicken breast. No spicing, no flavoring.

They do not have normal salsa. They give you a HEATED spicy/flavorful/red dipping sauce. As well they have a guacamole/green/creamy dipping sauce as well. It was tasty but not anything I had seen before.

If you object to garlic, beware. It is in EVERYTHING. I consider garlic a cheap flavor enhancer. Restaurants that rely on it for the flavor rate LOW in my opinion. With all the REAL spices and flavors, don't cheap out with garlic.

I was excited to see a new restaurant open in this location, but sadly, it is not my style. I wish I had known this before having my Birthday dinner there. It kind of ruined it for me."
test_1059,Great place.  Prices are the same or lower than other Marine dealers.  Fast service.  You can call one day and they usually have the part the next day if it isn't in stock..  Worked on my boat twice.  Big improvement over the prior occupants of the building.  Lots of good experience in the mechanic/owners.
test_1060,"I needed to look for a place and I have been exhausted from looking on days on end. I had my first exchange with Paramount Properties with Leah, she was very knowledgeable and personable. She made me feel welcomed and assured me that they would find something for my fianc√© and I. She was patient and regularly keep me informed. Leah communicated and set expectations all with positive attitude. I'm so glad we got to meet her and made our process smooth. I've worked with other property management companies in the past and none of them compare to Paramount Properties. I highly recommend them and will use them again in the future. Ask for Leah super attentive."
test_1061,"Luckily I'm in reasonable health so I haven't had to visit here often, so I've only been twice for annual checkups to renew a couple of prescriptions. I haven't run into the same issues as the other reviewer here. I booked my appointments pretty easily, each time I've visited it's actually been pretty empty. The check-in nurse who takes your weight, blood pressure etc is lovely, she remembered me a year later after a single visit! I really like Dr Finlay, he's great at explaining everything and doesn't rush through the appointment. 
I noticed that they've actually opened another practice on Priest Dr, which is much closer to my home, but I think I'm going to continue coming back to East Tempe, because I like the staff here. There's really nothing much more for me to add here... I was surprised by the other review so I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth."
test_1062,"Even though I don't own an Indian, I was recommended to this place because of their good customer services and prices. Prices seem to be a tad below average, from what I've seen. And this isn't a place that's in the business of ripping people off (like some shops I've been to). They genuinely care about the bikes and the people that ride them. 

Took my Harley here to get some old tires changed. They had the tires in stock. For both front and rear tires and tubes, I was out in under an hour. 

The service manager, Jason, was super helpful and courteous. Even though I was a first time customer, I was treated like I was a lifetime loyal member. Jason did exactly what he said he was going to do. No hidden fees, etc.

I will def be coming back here for future service on my bikes!"
test_1063,Just had a couple drinks & an appetizer but received good service and the snack was good. Decor was nice and atmosphere fine. Nothing to rave about but no real complaints either.
test_1064,"Great happy hour items and prices! Fast and friendly staff too!

Favorites were: fried zucchini, curly fries, honey hot wings,  asian  garlic wings, mandarin orange wings, onion rings. Asiago Parmesan wings were okay, probably wouldn't get them again though. 

Not so favorites: Strawberry hot wings (too sweet), Salt and pepper wings (way too much salt!), mozarella sticks. 

I like that they serve everything on metal plates, even if you get one or two of each flavor... but it does take up a lot of table space. 

Will be back to try more items!"
test_1065,"I am absolutely addicted to this place.  I work in CityScape so it's an easy walk for lunch, and I have to admit I've been eating here about three or four times a week.  Just really good, really convenient, very friendly, and I'm obsessed with their ""forbidden rice"" - it's actually purple, full of antioxidants and healthier than processed white rice."
test_1066,"This place is really good. Came here with friends, and the place was decently populated already. First off, I love how customizable everything is, including the spice level options. If you want a kick but not have your tteokbokki uncomfortably hot and spicy, order it with the Rose base sauce. The place is well lit with a nice modern vibe, and the staff were nice, accommodating and friendly. The tteokbokki itself was nice and chewy, just how it should be. The portions are big, so come hungry! I wasn't totally prepared so unfortunately, I couldn't fully finish mine. You won't have much trouble finding the place, it's easy to spot from Yonge Street - a bright yellow sign. Overall, great place to take a friend, date or small group (not large groups). Go Go Topoki! :3"
test_1067,"So happy I found this shipping service. Idalia is amazing at what she does.  She is an owner operator and knows everyone by name.  I came in as I hate going to the post office. I have gifts in the car that t i dont know how to box and wrap.  She takes care of it all for you.

Great promo on mailbox rental right now is pay for 1 year in advance and you only pay for 6 months! 
Gift wrapping and shredding available too.  
I loved the cute cards and little gifts she has in the store.
Fed ex, ups, dhl. She does it all. 

I definitely recommend you stopping in to the Mail Room and using them as your shipping services.  Plenty of parking and the best customer service."
test_1068,"I loved this hotel. The rooms were comfortable, stylish and clean. The bath products in the rooms were awesome too. Its a bit of a walk to the pool from this section of Mandalay Bay but thats ok. Im sad TheHotel is being converted into the Delano."
test_1069,"Coffee is very good and strong, although they only give you a cup of coffee compared to the jug of coffee they leave at your table at ihop, so they do offer a refill for $4.68. I got the lumber jacks special, it was countrystyle potatoes mixed veggies ham and sausage. It is typically served with country style gravy all over it, but I got it on the side, it was a bit too much for me last time. The place was clean and very spaced out, not too crowded, so I have to say it was very delicious! We will definitely return"
test_1070,"Great gym! People are very focused and on the mission to workout. Lots of people are in amazing shape, that is very motivating. There are a lot of people who you can ask for advice, most people know what are they doing. 

If you need more then just advice, then get a trainer. I had very positive experience with Gregg Block. He is an amazing, sweet, great, open-minded, and has very nice positive energy."
test_1071,ZERO STARS!!!!  Would be way more effective if more employees capable of something other than checking you in.  ALWAYS a mad house!  Found scheduling an appointment to be pointless.  Hate dealing with Apple
test_1072,"I've pick up some sushi at Ai sushi twice now and I'm pretty impressed. The fish was pretty fresh and beautifully presented. I loved the variety of sushi on the platter and it was super easy ordering through phone and picking up. I didn't need to wait super long and it was packed and ready to go each time. 
Yes. Fast. Bless."
test_1073,The food isn't that good. Kids fries came out cold and too any dogs and I would come back. Sorry!
test_1074,"My wife and I ordered at the same time.  I ordered the chicken eggs benedict which was gross.  It came out right away though.  My wife ordered chicken and waffles and it literally came out 30 minutes after my food.  The service was bad, the food was worse.  The chicken was all breading and no meat.  Pass on this place don't even think about waiting in the long line for this subpar food."
test_1075,"This is what a nail salon should look like. Cleanliness and genuine smiles is what I look for. I believe that you get what you pay for. Even though it's a bit pricier than other nail  salons, you'll be glad to spend the extra $15. M One of the lead technicians name is Holly. She has been my nail tech since last for over ten years does she still is for Leah she was the day I details on match, and her effort to make you comfortable doesn't go on ignored. I will be making this my regular nail salon from now on."
test_1076,"Added extra charges on return.

I am a gold member and have rented from the adrenaline collection in Orlando before with no problems. I have used Hertz in my hometown of Manchester when my car was being repaired. I rented a Challenger RT from the same collection for two weeks.

I have no qualms with the car, it was great and was ready in the bay when I arrived.

On return however, I was charged for a full tank of gas despite returning it almost full.

When I questioned this, I was told that I had taken the pre pay option under my rental agreement and would have been charged the same if I returned it empty. This is despite the rental desk saying you will be charged for what is used.

I have checked my rental agreement and there is no mention of this. Also, I pre-paid the whole bill months before I arrived, I spoke to nobody on arrival as it was reserved in a gold bay so where did I agree to this? Why wasn't I charged the pre-pay option when I paid in full?

This stinks of penny-pinching from Hertz and is not the way to treat a loyal customer.

Sadly, I won't be using Hertz again after this experience."
test_1077,"There's not much more I can say which hasn't already been said.  Fantastic food, great service (which included a lot of personal attention from the owner), and great prices.  The complimentary Ban Chan which came with our combo plate and Bi Bim Bap Hot Stone was tasty and added to the overall foodie experience.  The wife and I were last here 2 years ago (we don't come to Vegas often) and they have since extended out their dining room and given it a more clean, open, and inviting feel.  This is our ""go to"" whenever we come to town."
test_1078,"The good: The most important item a hotel can provide is a comfortable bed and mine was excellent. The rooms are clean and spacious. 

The bad: The hotel shuttle wasn't air conditioned and they picked us up in 95 degree heat. The person who checked us in also cooked our first meal and cleaned the lobby. Maybe they were understaffed but never seen this before. The NBA playoffs were on ABC and that channel did not work in our room so we went downstairs to the lobby to watch and although the channel was on they could not get the sound to work. There is no decent restaurants nearby (walking distance) so you're stuck with three fast food place and the hotel lobby restaurant which we tried our first night after checking out the other walk-able offerings. I ordered a spinach salad and they served a large plate of cut spinach and pretty much nothing else. 

Despite this, I would come back here due to the great beds and accept the fact that I'll need to eats meals away from the general vicinity.

Special note: If you can request John as your driver he is great and goes the extra mile (literally)."
test_1079,"I have been here a few times.  Sometimes the food is awesome, sometimes it is just good.  I think it depends on who is cooking.  I will say, the service has gotten much better as of late.  My server/bartender Jocelyn said she was new, but seems like she has been doing this forever.  I love her personality!  That alone will keep me walking through the door.  Also, on Sundays, I love Austin Walkin Cane's music on Sundays and the Bloody Mary bar is a great compliment to the brunch menu.  Oh, and they have WINE ON TAP!"
test_1080,"Chop chop is a little gem in the city in my opinion. Small family run business serving delicious Chinese food! I first came here after going to the boardgame caf√© just down the street and ordered a few dishes to try. The restaurant is quite small, probably about 20 seats on the inside, but they have a little terrasse area in the summer time to have a few more seating spaces. After the first visit I just couldn't stop thinking about chop chop and the next time I'll be going! I had to go back and try every dish! 
The general tao chicken, the sweet and sour pork, the dumplings, the ma po tofu, the pork and eggplant, the Chinese pancake, the salt and pepper squid, all are incredibly delicious! It taste so much like home cooked food, just like dishes my mom would make at home. And now that I've moved to a different city from my family, finding a place that taste like home is the best thing in the world. Even the atmosphere was very homely and the owners are super nice. 
The prices can be a bit higher than expected, each dish is about $12-14 depending on what you order, but the dumplings are around $8-10 a dish which is pretty good pricing. But honestly, I would pay the price for a little piece of home :)"
test_1081,"Experienced super fast service. Discovered a leak around the toilet. I called PlumbSmart right away (thanks to all the good Yelp reviews), and within 20 minutes, a plumber was at my door. He diagnosed the problem right away and completed the job very quickly. He was very professional. Cleaned everything up. Price was OK, but plumbers are always expensive (ie, not free). I will more than likely be using their service in the future."
test_1082,"I signed up for one of the glass blowing classes and it was great. The studio is behind a private home, but it's quite large. I went in early February and I was expecting it to be very hot inside, but it was very comfortable. Not sure if this will be the case in the Summer time in Phoenix, but I would guess John & Justin would have the AC on at that time otherwise they would pass out from the heat from the kiln.

The class itself was great. John & Justin make the class not only educational, but fun as well. Most importantly, they make the class safe. They keep an eye out on what you're doing so you do not hurt yourself and/or get burnt."
test_1083,This place gets 3 stars coz the beef nihari was just ok. The gravy was thickened with too much flour or what ever thickener they were using and it was not so great. The lamb chops had a nice crunch and marinade. So that was a win. Dal was satisfying. No lamb biryani. Ambience was nice. The nihari was a disappointment so maybe that overshadowed the food experience!
test_1084,"I LOVE this place! The food is delicious and the service is super friendly. 

During my most recent visit, I took my sister in for her birthday. It was her first time having Ethiopian. The people who work here we so friendly. They seemed just as excited as my sister, explaining the dishes and cooking styles; they seemed to really take pride in what they were doing. 

And they SHOULD take pride, because did I mention that the food is delicious!? The vegetarian feast is my favorite. I've also tried the zelzel wat (I think that's what it's called -- it's the beef) and homemade cottage cheese. All of it very yummy. 

The vibe is very cozy, almost like going to a friend's for lunch. I can imagine parking being a hassle if they had a rush of customers but I've never had a problem. That said, delivery from here is just as tasty as dine-in so don't let a little laziness get in the way of enjoying a good meal -- go ahead and have someone deliver it to you ;)

I hope this place does well. Seems like some really great people running it and I so love Ethiopian food! Definitely check it out, whether you are a long time fan of Ethiopian or a first timer, you will be glad you did!"
test_1085,"If your pee pee is micro, I promise I won't tell. But the Microtel will, so be careful.

This may or may not have happened in 2013 which is why it's review #2,013.

I had the hottest liason of my life here... can I put that on Yelp? Oh okay, well I just did. A girl who is famous (I can't tell you who she is) decided she wanted to come and hang with me, but not in Buffalo (I'm not sure what she has against Buffalo), so she chose Pittsburgh. She chose a cheap hotel, but it was actually lovely. It had a comfortable bed, and was clean - what more can you ask for, for a liason? We didn't do any sleeping whatsoever. I picked her up at the airport, we went to the room for maybe 6 hours, no sleeping, lots of outfit changes (her, not me. Nobody gives a sh** what outfit I wear, lol). Then out for late-night food all over Pitt. Then back to the room for another 6 to 8 hours (no sleeping). And so on, and so forth.

It's not really fair on other hotels, because I haven't been to those hotels with this particular girl, but that's not my fault. All I can do is give this hotel the 5 it deserves for giving us absolutely no problems whatsoever on one of the best nights of my life.

You might think that a poor starving artist who has never had a hit on Billboard probably doesn't really figure on the radar of celebrities. But this is not the first female celebrity who has taken an interest in me. However she is absolutely the best one. We're still very good friends and hopefully I'll be seeing her again very soon. I think she reads my Yelp reviews actually, so hopefully this one will score me some extra brownie points. Literally, brown because she's so damn tanned. In a good way.

I keep getting distracted, I'm trying to watch ""Man Vs Food New Orleans"" but instead I had to go look up pix of the girl in question. She's all over the internet, lol. But don't be jealous. I actually like boys, not girls. I just do a remarkable job of pretending otherwise because my mother is a raging homophobic."
test_1086,"I always prefer this theater, not only is it close to my house but the staff is always friendly. The last time I was there, I spilled my drink and the Manager Andrew was very attentive and gave me a refill.
Definitely my favorite theater!! Totally recommend it to anyone!"
test_1087,"We accidentally ended up at Anthony's lastnight.  We didn't yelp first which we normally do. 

We weer not disappointed by the food which was phenomenal. But we were a bit surprised with the top of the strip prices at am off the strip location. 

We both had prime rib which couldn't have been Amy better.  It melted like butter in your mouth. The yuckon mashed potatoes wete delish. The creamed corn just may be the best.  I was surprised they use a mild watery creamed horseradish, I prefer fresh ground horseradish with a bite. 

The service was perfect or glasses were never less than half full.  The waiter seated me and placed my napkin on my lap.  The bus boy used a scraper to clean the crumbs for the table cloth. Oh and for a nearby diner with a child they went to another establishment in the casino to get the child a pizza which he would eat. 

I highly recommend this place but be prepared for a large check at the end."
test_1088,"Whatever you do, DO NOT GET SUCKERED INTO THE PRESENTATION CRAP THEY DO HERE!!!!!! Absolutely horrible false advertising and unless you don't want to spend 4-5 hours in awkward forced conversation over s#itty food that makes you nauseous, go spend your time doing something else. As for the rooms they're just ok. I've noticed grimey floors and little bits of trash all over the carpet in the hall. Other than that it's ok nothing special. Trust me on the presentation for free gifts thing. Stay away!"
test_1089,"Where do I begin? This hotel was horrible and I mean horrible. The elevators smelled like urine, the carpet throughout the hotel had stains, dirt and God knows what else on it. It looked like it hadn't been shampooed since 1200 B.C. The hotel room my sister and I had sucked. There were stains on the carpet and the chairs. We didn't even want to walk on the floor without shoes on. The tv was super small and there were chips in the furniture. We were so creeped out by the room that when we were there (which was rare) we didn't sleep under the covers. We slept on top of the covers with our hoodies on. The bathroom was so small that when you sat on the toilet your knee hit the door. And let's not mention the tub filling up a tad bit when we took showers. Even though we didn't sleep under the covers housekeeping failed to change the sheets (not even once). I even combed my hair while sitting on the bed and shed a little. I came back later that night and she still had not changed them. Gross!! The only thing appealing about this hotel is the price so I guess in an essence, we got what we paid for."
test_1090,"Sushi is great, first time we came because it is a little farther than other places we normally go to"
test_1091,"Save your time & Cash ladies! 

One of the Worse Salons in Scarborough. I live so close to them and will never go back. I remember going once for a pedicure and it was my first and last. 
Besides Yuki, everyone else is disrespectful, lazy and their work is a hot mess. They tend to play deaf at your request, literally ignore everything you say and than think you'll pay the full price :/"
test_1092,"The Dowd Y is by far the best workout facility in the area for the money. From their class selection to workout equipment to friendly staff, you can't beat this gym. With a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the YMCAs in Charlotte, this gym is the best bang for your buck. 

In terms of classes, the Total Strength and Roc-it Circuit Training are great if you like direction when doing any sort of strength training. The Pilates, Yoga, Cardio Dance and Cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day. Only class that gave me pause was Athletic Conditioning - instructor bellowing orders at me over loud speakers for 60 minutes just isn't my cup of tea - but it is apparently a great workout as people come out of it drenched in sweat. 

I've very rarely seen an ""out-of-order"" sign on any equipment, and with multiple floors (including weight and cardio equipment in the ladies locker room), you hardly ever have to wait for a machine. Staff is uber-helpful and always cheery no matter what time of the day. 

Fair warning: parking can be a bit difficult in the evenings, and is downright ridiculous in January with all the newcomers. So if you're trying to make one of the multiple group exercise classes, give yourself extra time to park to save yourself some stress. 

Overall great experience; I highly recommend this gym."
test_1093,"Fresh ingredients, delicious food, good service.  Minus 1 star b'c it was a little confusing to get around the menu and for a buffet line with people behind the counter making your food, the whole process didn't run very efficiently.  Overall though, great experience."
test_1094,Service is horrible. Took weeks to get a date then canceled after I moved furniture. Most unprofessional and stressful experience. I would never recommend .
test_1095,"Strolled into this eclectic trendy restaurant on Mother's Day before the Nashville concert. My husband and my daughter were with me and we were seated right away. Our waiter was helpful and cheerful. I noticed the wait staff all had sleeves if tattoos and skinny jeans. They were out of fish and chips so I ended up getting a burger. It is build your own and it was very good! But my favorite was the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, so addicting  had a bacon Bloody Mary to go with and caught a little buzz. It was the mild version but woo, did it have some kick!! The cost was reasonable, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was worth it. We had a great time"
test_1096,"Hope Church does just that, gives you hope!  Pastor Vance and his team really do a great job in planning their messages. I always leave thinking about what was said and how I can use the information in my life and be an example in others life. 

There are three Sunday services, 9am, 11am and 6pm.  There is usually a full blown choir and worship team at each service and they do a fantastic job! This is one of the reasons I enjoy coming to Hope. 

When you walk in there are plenty of greeters and ushers so if you come for the first time your not going to feel out of place or lost. 

There is also a complementary coffee bar located in the lobby with Regular & Decaf coffee plus hot tea and hot chocolate. Usually there is some sort of sweets offered as well! 

Overall I enjoy coming to this church and I for sure plan on coming back for future services!"
test_1097,"I've had 2 experiences with this salon. Both were a little off. 
My fiance and I moved here in January of this year and soon were looking for a salon to call home. He grew up in Phoenix and had always gone to a Toni & Guy salon and loved how his stylist would take their time and make sure you got the cut you wanted.
So with Fashion Square Toni & Guy being the closest to us, I booked two appointments for the same day at the same time with 2 different stylists. When we arrived at the salon, they didn't have either of our appointments in their system...my first thought was whaaaat???? I could see one maybe, but both non-existent? weird.
They found us a stylist who had one opening that day and one the next day, so my fiance got his first. (honestly I wanted to make sure she was capable before I let her chop into my hair...we wont tell him that)
We were pleasantly surprised! I can't remember the girls name unfortunately, but she was awesome. She cut my fiance's hair and mine the next day and really listened to what we wanted and executed it perfectly. 
I thought to myself, Yay we found our girl! Alas, as she cut my hair to perfection, we made small talk and I found that she was moving to Australia!!!! Nooooooo!
Well since we had had one semi-good experience at this salon, even with our star stylist gone, I went to make another appointment for my fiance and I in August. I think I called on a Monday and made 2 appointments for Friday. My fiance actually had a friend cut his hair on that Tuesday, so I called Tuesday to cancel his appointment and mine as well, and when I called the receptionist said that our appointments weren't in their system, AGAIN!
I think the disorganization of this salon is what is killing their reviews. They need a tight ship Salon manager in there stat!

anyway, my fiance got a call on the Saturday after his supposed Friday appointment saying that we were a no-show for a cut on Saturday. I just shook my head, and told him I won't be making any more appointments their for us. Disorganization kills me!"
test_1098,"I have been here a few times and Louis has been here every time.

He's is the most polite, handsome bartender. He gets me food order correct and makes drinks like my savor Jesus.

He smells like baby powder and Corona.

The music is always good and the machines always pay."
test_1099,"Awesome hotel, Great service.  Million dollar view. LOVED IT."
test_1100,"Consistency is key in a restaurant so this year during our annual trip to Vegas we stayed at NYNY and decided to eat every main meal at Tom's to see if it was as good this  year as it was last year.  Items consumed included cheeseburger sliders (incredibly juicy, usually at places those little patties are dried out because they're small but these had juice running down my arm.. no lie!).. the spicy fried chicken and cornbread pancake (delicious and definitely spicy).. figgy piggy (lovely combination).. honey bbq chicken sliders (yum).. ginger chicken potstickers (crisp on bottom, soft inside like it's supposed to be & great dipping sauce) and we finally tried some desserts: the pineapple upside down cake (delicious albeit small) and the ridiculously ENORMOUS brownie/cookie/s'mores dessert which was decadent over the top but a decent value for $10 (easily would serve 4 people).. service was absolutely fine by 5 different servers (we had 5 meals there) so not sure why I see so many issues on their YELP page about service. We never had to wait long for anything, water was promptly filled, managers stopped by to check in and make sure needs were met.  So, our 2016 visit wasn't a fluke. 5 stars for 5 different meals. The only thing that would be cool is a frequent diner discount. haha
Looking forward to going back again next year if not sooner!"
test_1101,"We had a couples massage, foot massage and body oil massage with hot stone. It was a gift for the birthday girl from her husband and I was lucky to accompanying her!"
test_1102,Love the food. Sadly last time I ordered a ceaser salad to go and they didn't include the dressing which I didn't realize until I was back at the office. My only complaint really.
test_1103,"I have been coming here on and off, but I have always got a great meal out of it. The food is very price worthy and, as I most probably wouldn't make this a place where I would hang out and drink, they have that option too. 

I had the schwarma last time, which basically is a pita wrap of the kind that can be found all over Europe. Tasty to say the least.. but I have to get better at trying out their curry dishes, because they look and smell fantastically. 

Some people say they have gotten bad service here, but I never have had a bad experience. It's very casual and I must say I appreciate that. As I said, its more a place to eat than a place to hang out at."
test_1104,"Huge portion but nothing special.  We had the galbi chicken June meat combo that many people raved about.  Chicken was too sweet.  June meat is boring.  The galbi, however, was very good."
test_1105,"I've watched an older lady working here give customers an attitude, then kick the customer out if they didn't pull out their ID fast enough. Another time, she accused this man of hiding his ID photo with his thumb and kicked him out when he moved his thumb. Another time, she didn't ID a girl who was clearly underage but then gave the man who was behind her in line a hard time, even though he looked at least 40. This woman is rude and I avoid this location solely because of her. She thought my ID was fake and bent it until it cracked, then when I pulled out my passport she thought that was fake too. Don't go to this location. You'll just get hassled."
test_1106,"Went today for the sushi buffet and while the food was decent enough for a buffet setting I was not a fan of a few things:
- the sushi rolls were not labeled
- tongs were not available for each plate causing people to use the same tong for multiple plates
- the sushi side of the buffet was kind of a mess when it came to forming a line

I will give it to them, the food was fresh and rotated very often. Each time I went up to the sushi table there was a fresh plate for several of the rolls.

My boyfriend isn't a fan of sushi so he sampled the hot food ... it was pleasant enough but it lacked variety. 

Overall we had a good time, but I don't think we will add this into the rotation until we sample more places to see what's out there."
test_1107,"If I could give this place less than one star I would. Where to start, first off they re-heat old French fries in dirty oil. Even after I called back the second time to ask them not to. Their food is sub par and dirty. Now all that aside I had an issue with them messing up an order and called in to ask them to fix this, the girl over there was rude and defensive to my claims that the wrong toppings were placed on the burger we had ordered. I specifically said no tomato and she specifically repeated that back to me as we'll so I know it wasn't her fault. She passed me over to the manager who was really mad that he had to come to the phone and explained to him that the person is allergic to tomatoes and that we'd appreciate it if they could send us a new one...he said rudely ""no just scrape the fu@$ng tomato off. I told him that she's allergic and that there is still tomato all over even if we scrape it off. He said too fu&$% bad we're not sending you anything. I asked him why he was so mad and he said cause I'm fu%^# busy cooking wtf do you want and hung up. NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Bottom line aside from the fact the employees are so jaded and disgruntled the food is just nasty dirty re-used oil re-heat fries and just dirty!"
test_1108,"I mean its the Venetian in Las Vegas - already so so many reviews that everything is said and done ! Nevertheless here some greats pros of this place

- Free parking
-Tons and tons of food options - for all wallets - food courts, high end restaurants etc .
- always opening new places - latest entrant is the dorsey lounge (amazing drinks btw!)
- easy access to strip, palazzo, grand canal shoppes
- obviously the entire venetian feel
- decently priced rooms - but not all have good views

Cons
- Tao is okish - compared to other clubs in towns - so if you are looking for easy entry into other clubs , don't stay here
- Check in was slow with long lines
- VIP check in desk closed ?? - we could not check in faster
- not as modern like the Cosmopolitan


But you could totally have a fun day - without ever leaving the hotel !"
test_1109,"Any place that has belly dancers shake their stuff in your face during dinner gets high marks in my book.

I think the belly dancer(s) are there only on the weekends around 8, but you might want to check it out.

Loved the food.   Garlic naan, very good.  The kitchen is partially open which is nice because you can see them put the meat skewers out of the ovens (maybe they call them tandoors or something) anyways very good food.

I bit more upscale than most other Indian places in the valley."
test_1110,"Red Robin is hopping on a Friday night...service was great. Go Matt!  Attentive, friendly, and efficient. Our burgers were delicious and those fries are the best.  I had the DGB ...I heard music with the first bite.  What a wonderful combination of favors.  My son had the Royal burger and the egg was beautiful.  He complained that the bacon tasted like microwave bacon....but managed to eat every bite.  Red Robin....hummmmmm"
test_1111,"I couldn't leave the parking lot without posting this !!! 
If I could give this bank 0 star I would!!! The worst bank to treat business owners!!! I have a business account and no matter how busy or how slow they are, they will always make me wait FOREVER when I make the business line or merchant line. If you're a business owner don't come to this place. Go to the one on Rainbow and Westcliff. They will treat 100 times better than all this horrible employees at the windows here !!!  

What's the point on having a business line for if you still treat us equal. Should get rid of that line if not gonna be priority !!!"
test_1112,"This restaurant is definitely one of my favorites in Glendale. I have been here many times with my husband, and have never had a bad experience. We love the atmosphere, the FOOD, and the staff is very friendly! I would absolutely recommend the white pizza and the bruschetta! 

Overall, best pizza and best prices in the West Valley!"
test_1113,"Beware. Cheap rates might seem enticing but you might end up paying more in the long run. I rented a car here and requested an economy car for gas mileage (Had to drive over 400 miles) and specifically requested a ""Ford Focus or similar"" for their 35 mpg. Got there after my flight - long line with one attendant. after waiting over 25 minutes in line, they told me that they didn't have my car but were going to ""upgrade"" me to their SUV. I refused and asked if they had any other cars in nearby locations and they said no, but come back tomorrow.

I went back the next day and they said sorry we still don't have your car for you. So they forgot to add ""you might get lucky"" when they told me to come back tomorrow. I assumed that they told me to ""come back tomorrow"" because they would have resolved the error. Not ""come back tomorrow"" so that we can tell you NO again. So I got stuck with a 17 mpg gas guzzler.

After spending $70 more in gas that I should have, I complained to the counter and requested a discount since their error caused me to spend more money on gas. Not only was the manager unaccomodating, she was very rude and patronizing and said you should have come back so we could fix it. I told her I did, and she continued to tell me that it was NOT their error and then act as though she never made the suggestion that i should have ""come back tomorrow"".

Never, ever again. Payless. I should have known better to begin with."
test_1114,Traveled from CA to ID. This was a good hotel in our travels. The water pressure in their showers is great! It was clean and quiet and safe. We stayed at this hotel with dogs. It was a good choice. The area for the dogs is in the back right corner of the property. I would stay here again.

test_1116,"Honestly, if I could give this place zero stars I would. I have been in twice? or just once before. Last summer I took my car in to get the oil changed and walked out with a list of $700+, almost $800 worth of work they said needed done. Since I was headed on a 4,000+ mile roadtrip in a couple of weeks I decided to take it up to the Big O Tires in Show Low, where I usually get my oil changed when I am up visiting. They looked at my car and confirmed that some of the things did need done, found a couple of other things and all in all it was less than $500 to get it all done. 

Went back in today to get an oil change, they advertised a $16.95 oil change special which somehow would have cost $32 an change. They also said that my front tires were completely bald and I needed two new ones. Hmmm interesting, you must have only looked at the treads on the outside of my left tire that are a bit low, but not the rest of the tire OR the front right tire which is the same as the back two. 

 After sitting for almost 15 minutes during which time another work told a lady it would take about 2 hours I went and asked for my keys back and left. 

Won't be back again."

test_1121,"I love this location! If you make a reservation you get seated fairly quickly. Their food is delicious and the prices are reasonable for a steak dinner. Did I mention their food is delicious?

I have even been there for lunch and the roast beef sandwich with Au jus is amazing!"
test_1122,"I just love this store, there French toast and artichokes, watermelon and s'mores are fantastic. Because of their customer friendly return policy I'm encourage to try their products and so far I'm pleased.

test_1123,"Do not come here!!! The staff is unbelievably rude, super over priced & horrible service. They do not listen to you about what you want and don't even do a good job. My pedicure was just the lady painting my toes. Didn't file, scrub or do anything else!!"
test_1124,"I've been a loyal customer of superior tire for a couple years, but I just realized that there is another location on Sahara 5 minutes from my business. I got in, and I could smell coffee and Was Greeted by a friendly technician named Tim who looked to know what he's talking about, he brought to my attention a very important mistake.

Coffee, water, AC and baseball are always a good thing when ITS 110F outside.

I was using synthetic blend instead of full synthetic and if it wasn't for his advice, God knows what complications I would have had after. and was recommended a synthetic oil blend just like it says on my car's manual, it was Tim who took of the car and also accommodated my need to have the oil change done in a timely manner. Looks like my car is gonna be having her spa day at Tim's location from now on. They have also great deals on tire rotation and balancing and the location is yelp friendly. 

I don't always review the automotive shop but when the customer service is excellent, I make sure it's a long detailed review 

Cheers"
test_1125,"We are enjoying the happy hour crowd and it's chaos, but are here because of the bartender Billy and his posse more than anything. The service industry is hard work and I totally appreciate his fun attitude and charisma. Vegas people watching is fun but the bartender makes it better!"
test_1126,"Went here Friday evening after work for happy hour around 630-7ish.  We ended up liking the atmosphere and posted up until like 11PM!  The music they played was actually pretty good, not ALL country music.  The crowd was interesting, 25-30 somethings with a few 50's sprinkled in the mix.  There was the normal Scottsdale crowd...you know, bedazzled jeans/belt buckles, shmedium sized shirts.  Then there were your random camo wearing cowboy hats.  And just your average people.  So it was a nice mix and definitely some great people watching.  

We had the Chips and Dip for $7.  It was.....bleh.  The chips were soggy and lip so in order to get the dip onto the chip you had to use a fork and fold it over. Eh.....

On a good note our bar tender was awesome !  She was super attentive (even once it got packed) and funny!  She made killer drinks and chatted it up with us ladies, and if you're a lady...you know that can be quite rare.  

Another interesting thing is their band is above the bar.  So, if you're sitting at the bar you just see flailing arms, the end of a guitar and the occasional hair flip.  The band on Friday was not too great so we preferred the DJ over the live brand which is surprising.  The later it got into the evening the longer the line got leading up to the door.  When I go back again I will be doing it the same way I did (happy hour into the night), I don't foresee myself waiting in line to get in. 

I am looking forward to going back and sitting at a booth with a little mini tap and ordering some beer and kicking back.  Maybe having food with a little more substance in hopes that it's yummier than the Chips and Dip.  I will definitely be back to this bar!"
test_1127,"My spouse and I came here for some hibachi.  I had the chicken while my spouse had the beef and shrimp.  

My spouse loved her meal.  It came hot and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  

For my meal I found my spring roll was cold and the chicken was swimming in sauce.  I may consider getting a beef dish rather than chicken. 

The server was very friendly and very attentive.  The place offers a reasonable meal and a good price."
test_1128,"Had an appointment with Lindsey from lashinglocks and I was extremely disappointed. I had to wait a while to get an appointment. I texted her telling her My lashes were super balled and asked if she was able to give me some more time to fill my lashes and she said she was booked and that I could only get the hour that I had originally scheduled. I wasn't upset and totally understandable. The problem didn't start until she was telling me that she was going to charge me for a full set because my lashes were so balled... even though I was only getting an hour of her time (where a full set takes 2 hours) and she admitted that my lashes would not be as full as a regular full set.... what I don't understand is why I am paying for a FULL SET when I am NOT getting the same amount of time or product as I would if I actually got a full set. I told her I agreed that my fill should be more expensive but asking me to pay for time and product I don't have is ridiculous. Let's just say, I didn't end up getting my lashes done by her at the end of the conversation."
test_1129,"I had been meaning to check this place out for awhile now, so when I found myself running some errands on that end of town the other morning I decided to stop in to grab a quick bite. The restaurant itself was super cute inside. They had a variety of fresh baked goods - the funfetti scone caught my eye so I got one of those and also ordered a coconut milk mocha. The coffee was good and the scone was excellent. Looking over their regular menu I see that they offer a lot of healthy vegan dishes that sound delicious so I'll definitely be coming back to have a proper sit down meal and explore the menu a little more."

test_1132,"Brides, stop your wedding venue searching and go to Wedgewood Las Vegas at Stallion Mountain!!!! You will not regret it. They just won Best Wedding Spot of 2017 best of Nevada award, so awesome and well deserved. I got married on 9/9/2017. It was a beautiful day, the weather was perfect and more importantly the venue was perfect. I was not stressed at all, no bridezlla and I owe it all to the awesome staff at Wedgewood. 

Rewind to 2016, when I first started searching for my perfect venue. I researched venues online since it was a destination wedding. I couldn't stop looking at Wedgewood and the pictures and what they have to offer. My first venue appointment was at Wedgewood, I met with Jacquelyn. Jacquelyn is the sweetest person I have ever met, she told us everything we wanted to know and answered all of my questions and said we can do that, we can do anything you want. We did go to 2 other venues that day and I wanted to leave the other venues right away because I knew my answer was saying yes to Wedgewood as my perfect wedding venue. The pricing is very reasonable and you will not find a better price around. We did the Emerald package and it was so worth it. 50-100 people and we could have an open bar for the whole wedding 5 hours.   

Jacquelyn, the wedding coordinator, yes you have your own wedding coordinators the whole time planning and the day of the wedding. I give so much credit to Jacquelyn. She has been through it all with me and I can now say I have gained a new friend. She answered every email within the hour of sending. I never knew how easy it was to plan a wedding, Wedgewood gives you so many options and you just get to do the fun stuff and pick out colors, food and d√©cor. Jacquelyn was the coordinator the day of the wedding and I was so happy, because she knew everything we wanted and where we wanted it. I was so nervous the day of the wedding, so normal, Jacquelyn took me to show me the d√©cor in the reception area and my nerves calmed down and I had tears in my eyes because it was so beautiful and more than I dreamed. Jacquelyn is so professional and great at what she does, it takes a special person to talk to brides all day long.;) 

We chose Wedgewood's vendors and I loved them all. So happy they give you suggestions of vendors and they do chose the best in Vegas. Everyone is so nice and so accommodating. We went with Stephen Salazar photography and they were so awesome and so nice. I can't wait to see our pictures, since I can't stop looking at his work (other photos he has taken), so excited. We went with ACS Ann for the d√©cor and flowers, wow simply amazing. My flowers were so beautiful, I about cried when I saw them. The d√©cor was amazing, I had draping for the ceremony and for the reception. So beautiful. The pricing is very reasonable and you won't find a better price around. I chose Stevee Danielle for my updo. So professional and so nice. I had a trial and I loved it and I couldn't wait for the big day. Erica was my stylist and I had 3 bridesmaids get their hair done. Erica came to the hotel room the day of the wedding and she had all of us done within 1 hour and 30 mins. and our hair stayed in place all night long. Great pricing also. We also had the photo booth (Shutterbooth), which is a must, they make a book by the end of the night for you and your husband of all your guests that took pictures in the photo booth and your guests get to sign the pages. My guests had way too much fun in the photo booth, clearly from the pictures. What a great way to remember your night. We went with Freed's Bakery, the best cake I have ever had. We just finished our cake after 2 weeks and it was still so moist and delicious. We chose Pastor ED, that was unable to make it that day but we were blessed to have Pastor Don and he was great. DJ Tom, wow I give him so much credit. He did a fantastic job!!! He tried to please all my guests with all the song requests. He was very professional and very fun!!! I hope all listed all of the vendors. This is why I chose Wedgewood because there is so much to remember when planning a wedding and I didn't have to do the thinking Wedgewood did all of the hard work for me!!! 

I also want to mention the food, wow blew my shoes right off. So, so, so good!!! I had to try everything, which my plate was so full!!! Everything was so delicious. Evi, the head chef is awesome, so are all of his staff. My husband and I got to go through the buffet first (at Wedgewood, you can pick buffet or plated, we went buffet because of the cool buffet room) Evi and his staff helped us plate our food, they held our plate and got our food for us, we felt like royalty. Wedgewood has the best food ever, so much to chose from, 8 salads, yes 8, they were all so yummy. 
All of my guests can not stop talking about our wedding and how beautiful it was and how fun it was. All of my guests loved it all and want to go back. 
I want to thank everyone at Wedgewood and the vendors!! Best day ever"
test_1133,"Food is horrendous, but the worst part is the SERVICE IS TRASH. The manager with the beard is a robot with no knowledge in how to treat customers. Lady bartender is always giving beading eyes. The place is run by novices."
test_1134,"This is the only Tropical smoothie I go to, although they are busy quite a bit, if you order online or through the app your guaranteed not to wait long or at all. I love the Caribbean jerk bowl/wrap, the breakfast wraps, and of course my favs the healthnut/Muscle blaster. And it doesn't hurt that  the girls working there are really nice and greets you with a smile EVERYTIME(and that's rare now a days)."
test_1135,"I took my daughter who has Celiac's Disease to Jewel's.  She tried the BLT, she loved the bread and the sandwich overall.  The bacon was way under cooked thus the missing star.

We tried the macaroons, they were fresh and delicious.  We took home a cupcake and a cinnamon roll which my daughter really liked.  

We were there at lunch time on a Saturday and it was super busy, we had to wait a bit to order.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We will be back for sure, nice to have new place to go."
test_1136,"Ciro is the BEST personal trainer and physical therapist I've ever had.  I recently had a total knee replacement.  His patience and persistence has helped me overcome personal fear of my strength and abilities.  He personally focused on ME, giving me skills to practice on my own at home to build strength and confidence so that I can continue on my fitness journey.  His knowledge and education of kinesiology and years of experience helped create personal selected stretches to get the mobility and bending back in my knees.   I don't think I would have come this far in treatment and progress if it wasn't for Ciro's watchful eye.  He has been a tremendous help in my rehabilitation. If you need a physical therapist/personal trainer I highly recommend Ciro at Fit By Ciro, Anytime Fitness 7 Hills, Henderson NV."
test_1137,"Good ambience, friendly staff, and delicious food. Nice selection of fresh food and healthy toppings like avocado and masago and brown rice and green salad base."
test_1138,"I was passing by with a friend and decided to check out some fruits. The shop is small but enough to get the essential. The price is really cheap at high quality compared to chain groceries like Metro and Loblaws. It's Chinese New Year, so they are selling some mini tangerines with leaves. Wish they would sell some bigger ones for big fortune. End up buying some green grape only."
test_1139,"Under new mgmt???!!  Where's Ruby??  . I had to settle for another lady. Hope she's as good as Ruby was. I'll update later after I get my pedi. 

Does anyone know where Ruby is?"
test_1140,My family went on the West Rim tour about 2 weeks ago with Dwayne as our guide. He was great! He was enthusiastic and funny and kept us entertained for the whole ride. We were picked up right on time from our hotel and got a small breakfast on the bus. There were just enough stops to stretch our legs and use the bathroom and the trip went by relatively quickly. There is a lot to see when you get to the canyon and 3 hours is a perfect amount of time to spend. We would definitely recommend this tour to anyone!
test_1141,"This is a review by a vegetarian.
This is a review of Brunch.

Final score:

Scott, after a week in Utah with few vegetarian options: 1
Bellagio Breakfast Buffet: 0

Boy it's tough to breakeven without going for a plate of Scottish smoked salmon but I may have eaten $16 worth of french toast, waffles, fresh fruit, fruit sauce, fruit juice chocolate croissant, yogurt, granola, and PIZZA!! there is pizza for breakfast!! (the only thing better would be if they had cold pizza as well).

The wait staff that handles drinks is attentive and seemed to remember everyone who had decaf and who had leaded."
test_1142,"Update: Apparently has been sold to new owners. Still decent, but none of the original and exotic flavors like the previous owners. Standard fare gelato but not the destnation place it used to be. Changed to four stars."
test_1143,"About as solid diner food as you can get. Everything I've gotten here has been solid, if a bit overpriced. Nonetheless, I go there regularly."
test_1144,I love this store because they have all the top brand names in clothing for the plus size individuals. Who says you can't have beautiful clothes and be a plus size person. The store is amazing. All the displays are matched perfectly and it's easy to get around in the store. The staff gets an A+ in my book for customer service. I'm a repeat customer and am usually always greeted by name.
test_1145,"I had been meaning to try place for a while. It's a stone throw away from my old high school, Shadow Mountain, so I was happy to see a new restaurant breathe life into this strip mall. I've now gone twice in the last month and each time I've been pleasantly delighted. With the weather finally cooling down, their patio is nice and serene with trees and shrubs surrounding it.  For a brief moment you forget you are in parking lot. It's also nice that their patio is pet friendly as well. So on the first visit I got their OMG sandwich. Oh my was it good! It's a combination of Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Fig  and Honey. Need I say more ;) . On my second visit I got their tuna sandwich, the tuna salad was good. The only thing I wish is that they could offer another type of bread besides Ciabatta, since it seemed like the bread to tuna salad ratio was a little off. Other than that I'm a firm believer in local businesses and I hope this one continues to thrive!"
test_1146,"First time here at this Trader Joe's and I have to say--I had a wonderful experience.  The aisles are clean, employees were checking the products to make sure the dates were fine (meat section), and the people here are happy!  Kris checked us out and she really made our night--her positive vibes really made us feel welcomed at this Trader Joe's.  Kudos to Kris!"
test_1147,LOVED this place!!! The chicken and biscuit was DELISH  highly recommend! The staff was excellent and accommodated our large party and were on top of their A game. Do try it out :)
test_1148,"Fast, friendly and an amazing price! Jordan did a great job! 

My 2 year old didn't even have time to get cranky!"
test_1149,"I've been a Woody's customer for over a decade -- purchased a couple of guitars, a bass for my Dad and an amp from there, and it's always been my go-to place for picks and strings over the years. 

The owner and staff have always been super friendly, chatty and helpful, which inspired me to recommend Woody's to friends looking to buy guitars or other musical instruments.

I still recommend them when it comes to that. However ...

I received a whole different treatment when I recently went into Woody's looking to SELL an instrument. The owner would barely even look at me, and they made me wait around awkwardly for ages for someone to actually check out my guitar.

In the end, a young man with a sour expression on his face quickly looked my instrument over and offered $25, which I just as quickly declined (I later sold it on eBay for $200).

I do understand that Woody's is a small business and needs to make a profit. I totally support that. This review is more about how they made me feel like an unwelcome weasel during the experience than it is about the offer itself. 

In a nutshell, you'll get down-home, personal service when you go to Woody's to make a purchase, but expect big-box store treatment if you're selling something there.

Please change that mindset, Woody's, or you'll lose even more customers."
test_1150,"awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint. 

yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought. 

i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.

although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later! 

hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!"
test_1151,"More than ice cream and sammiches. They have this Cajun chicken that is AMAZEBALLS. It's not like any other Cajun chicken you have had, trust me. It's spicy and so flavorful. 

I personally love the salad version with their homemade vinaigrette, my hubster prefers the sammich version. You can't go wrong with either. It's a cute little family owned shop that has always been pleasant to us. Plus they have a quirky sense of humor. Peep their register display screen the next time you are there ;)"
test_1152,"If you're into pinball machines, old and new, this is your place.  Hundreds of machines of almost every genre--the old ""newly electrified"" games of the late 40s, solid-state games of the 70s and 80s, shooting games, all the way to digital machines--all working and lovingly maintained under one roof.  Take your quarters or small bills, and enjoy an afternoon here.  I liked that the machines take their original amount, so most machines are still just a quarter.

There are also drink and candy machines (not just a quarter) in the building.  If you're staying at one of the casino resorts along the Strip, it is easy to get there by cab--maybe $10 or so, each way.  If you're willing to navigate the transit system, it's a pleasant couple of buses to get there."
test_1153,"Today was maybe the 5th or 6th time ordering from here. We've had the pizza & it's amazing. I'm from Long Island so when it comes to pizza, I can be very picky. Closest thing to Pizza from NY!
Today we had the pasta with chicken and tomatoes on a garlic sauce, with cheese garlic bread & cannolis. Excellent!
The delivery is fast & the food is always hot & fresh!
Definitely the best pizza & price in town!
Living in Vegas for almost 11 years, a Long Island NY native with my family owning 3 pizzerias, this is the real deal!
Vinny is a sweet heart  & the place is just like back home!"
test_1154,"Raining or shine ... the Fountains of Bellagio is one of my all time favorite! Enjoyed it many times and never got tired of this beautiful show!
Since the music always changes ... the fountain show never been boring!
Did you notice Tiesto's music got in the schedule, too!
I love all, but the best for me is Bocelli: Time to say goodbye ... 
Shows are free and frequent! Hard to miss. If you did miss one, just wait 15 minutes and it will be on again. The last show of the day is at Midnight!

A lot of people trying to get the best spot, so it is advisable to be around the area ahead of time, of course, according to your schedule!"
test_1155,"1st time checking this place out.. I must say it is bomb!! The pizza was stacked with toppings, literally like 2inch high of just straight up toppings!! The wings were huge and flavorful!! Staff here are very attentive and charismatic. They have lots of tables and tv's; which is a plus!! I would absolutely recommend this location."
test_1156,Authentic food that is well worth the price. No msg used and fried rolls are made with rice paper. The service is excellent!
test_1157,"How can you not love a place that has 3 different kinds of Cholula and 2 kinds of Tabasco?!  AWESOME.  That alone is worth 5 stars.

I thought I should go with the house specialty and went with a ""Brizza"" - I ordered the Chicago, which has rosemary potatoes, sausage and cheese, but I substituted the regular sausage for turkey sausage.  Yummy.  The only disappointment was the crust - it was kind of doughy and just didn't have much flavor, thought they could have done more with it honestly (it was very plain).  I ended up eating mostly the toppings and left much of the pizza dough on the plate.

Extra points for having Coke products, and I will definitely have to return to try the french toast or cinnamon rolls.

I also liked the fact that your ordered & paid at the counter and then they brought your food out to you.  Very efficient and quick.

Overall, 2 thumbs up, and I will be back if I'm in the area for breakfast."
test_1158,"I love it here. My god, I think I inhaled my food. It's a great place to come to eat after you've been drinking or perhaps, WHILE you are drinking. My only wish is that they had more food options on the happy hour menu. That would make this place over the top. 

The service was great! I should have caught her name but our waitress was very attentive to our needs and had a great smile on her face despite it being late at night.

Our order: 2 yummy blue moons, loaded tator tots, chicken and mushroom pizza, and garlic Parmesan wings. 

What a freakin' meal! It was the perfect bar meal ever! Wait, I should mention that I didn't really enjoy the chicken/mushroom pizza but well, the other 2 made up for it. The tator tots were so crunchy even after being attacked by the sour cream. The bacon. The cheese. The green onions. OHHHHH MY GOODDD. I loved it. Can you not tell?

And those wings. Man, I love wingstop.. but geez, these ones have topped them. They were crunchy and had a light garlic taste. Dip that in ranch and bam! Explosion of flavor!

I was seriously full but I NEEDED to finish the food. I washed it all down with a large pint of blue moon and called it a night.

Sierra gold's tator tots should be worth it's weight in GOLD!"
test_1159,"1st time here. Fabulous pizza!  Some of the best I've had. And the owner (Biaggio) is a very good person, he runs the place with a living touch. The meat lovers pizza was incredible. Highly recommended."
test_1160,"This place is amazing, I could  Have stayed there for hours. Not a good place for small children however, unless they are strapped in the stroller and can't reach anything, unlike mine. But it is a great place for small parties or getting gifts or if you are a chef or if you like to cook -its an oil and vinegar wonderland. The staff was Super helpful and walked me through delicious oil and vinegar tastings. Next time ill try the wine or scotch!!"
test_1161,"I've been coming here for years , new ownership a few months back and since then the bartenders that has been here for years quit and service now is horrible . Manager and other bartenders are rude only sit and talk to their friends . Drinks are weak food has gone down hill I would not recommend coming here , ever . Unless your friends with the manager or bartenders"
test_1162,"I'm surprised I've never written a review for here, I've been here at least 10 times. Great beer list and ambiance! The open garage doors make for great outdoor seating. The chicken Cobb salad is always amazing with hooks cheese, however today I tried the cucumber avocado sandwich.  It did not disappoint, very flavorful and filling! I don't agree with the negative reviews, this place is great!"
test_1163,"Food is great but the service is slow. My party of 12 waited over 40 mins to get our food and the restaurant was not busy.  The resto was likely understaffed in the kitchen. 

The $7.99 lunch specials are a great deal (11.30-2pm). You can choose an app, curry, and side of rice. Definitely recommend choosing the Fried rice or Manchurian rice as it has more flavour over the Biryani. 

Again, the wait was long on the day I visited. Next time I'd likely call ahead an order for pick up!"
test_1164,"as always, fabulous food and outstanding service. Our server natalie is outgoing and cheerful, respectful and down to earth. The hostess' Holli and Rebecca are enchanting and their smiles brighten the room. They're both warm, loving people and bring radiant energy to the restaurant."
test_1165,Always consistent with great food and service... Definitely recommend this place... I hit it every chance I get when I'm in Las Vegas. Recommend the pastrami corned beef all of their Breads and desserts are awesome.
test_1166,"Room was smoky (kitchen smoke, not cigarettes) so they really will have to look at the ventilation before winter.

Very able waiter, Adam.

Great selection of interesting beer on tap at very fair prices (I think it was $6 a pint.)

The wine list though struck me as a profit making gouge - there aren't many Cote du Rhones worth $50 in a resto.

I dragged my partner down there specifically because I had read they served one of my favourite food items, sweetbreads (which are very hard to find these days and are a pain to prepare at home.) But what they did to these delicately flavoured thymus glands was a travesty (basically serve them like wings dosed in hot sauce)  and an insult to the calves that offered them up.

The pork chop was incredibly salty, to the point it made my head kinda spin (in a bad way.) Waiter explained that was a result of how they'd made it (cured I think, like bacon or duck confit). But they gotta find a way to get the curing done and then get some of the excess salt out before serving.

but overall, good value, a buzzing scene and pretty adventuresome cooking. I would try it again but will make more careful choices.

Peter

PS. Oh yea, should have added, don't forget your reading glasses and maybe a flashlight. the menu is printed in teeny tiny type almost impossible to read."
test_1167,"It was clean, looked fancy and had good service. There was no wait time when I went there which is normal for a weekday but there was also a decent crowd inside. 

When it came to food, it could have been better though. I have definitely been to better steakhouses south of the border. Still the food was cooked to order, I ordered medium 10oz tenderloin and it was exactly medium cooked. However, lacked the taste I was looking for from a tenderloin. If they work on the sauce and the seasoning they can be a 5 star place."
test_1168,"In love with the lak-sa! I think i found one of the best places for laksa noodles in sauga. 

This Malaysian style cha chan tang has fast service and good value. Definitely a place to fill your belly on a budget. It doesn't look much but it's pretty filling! 

Ordered the pancake roll with meat floss and corn, laksa, and Malay sandwich. Everything was pretty tasty. The pancake was light, crunchy and a bit chewy. The laksa noodles contained udon, chicken shreds, half boiled egg, lettuce and bean sprouts with a bit of a kick to it. The sandwich is filling with the layered toast-so make sure you open wide!

Will come again to try the other items!"
test_1169,"This is a family event.  Loud music, free peanuts and lots of excitement.  

We really love the ribs and only come for those.  They are the best however from time to time they get really charred.  This time was one of those times.....but still fall off the bone.

Potato skins appetizer was pretty overcooked and some pieces were inedible.

Everything but the rubs were mediocre, have the ribs!

Note:  only one men's stall and it was taken for more than 20 minutes - had to take the young man into the ladies.  Oh and be careful, I watched a number of people slip on the food and peanut shells on the floor."
test_1170,"The food was ok,  Service was terrible, they took forever to take our order (10 min for water),  they never stop on the table if we wanted something else.  The completely forgot about us.  We have to walk to the front  counter to ask for the check. We will diffinetly not come back and not recommend this place to anyone!"
test_1171,This is a great small local business! Keith and his staff are always top notch in service! They have everything you need for disc golfing ( new and used )! Stop in for all the latest greatest! They also rent bicycles and are located along the Scottsdale greenbelt! Great place!
test_1172,"Agreed.  Customer service at this location is such a joke.  I don't understand how this place is still in business.  All the reviews of BBQ galore are horrible and everything is overpriced.  I am a avid grillmaster and I always want to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but everytime I come in, I walk away disappointed.

Chris, if you are the manager of this location...you might want to hire a more friendly staff.

This place is a joke!"
test_1173,"Local renov√© , file d'attente plus rapide, prix plus elev√© aussi mais on se bourre avec les frites qui debordent de l'assiette :))
Always good after a bike ride or after weeds at tam tam ;)"
test_1174,"We went to the Stable Grille since the Stone House was closed for a catered event.  They did a really nice job with the interior of the barn.  They managed to keep it barn like but still work as a functioning restaurant.  
The rest of our party seemed to enjoy their food, but I'm giving them four stars for the schnitzel alone.  I lived in Germany for a while, and schnitzel was one of my restaurant staples.  And they got it almost exactly right.  It could have been a little thinner, but it was breaded and cooked perfectly and the smell and flavor was dead-on.  I was very impressed.  The twice baked cheese potato was a nice side as well."
test_1175,I have recently lost a lot of weight by eating healthy and fresh fruits and vegetables. As well as cutting calories and watching portions sizes. That being said I eat a lot of fruits and veggies. This Safeway has some of the worst produce I have seen in Scottsdale. If you want fresher fruits and vegetables go elsewhere. Twice I bought mini cucumbers and they were rotten when I opened them up at home!
test_1176,"I wasn't sure how to rate this, because the parts that were good were pretty great, but they also stepped on my chronically sore toes a couple of times.

Number one pet peeve: Any steakhouse that doesn't include salad and potato with the entr√©e will never get five stars from me. Seriously. $40 for a steak and you can't throw in a little lettuce and the world's cheapest vegetable? If they upped the price to $50 and included the sides, I would feel much less ripped off, even if that is not the reality. Perception is truth.

In their defense, their salads were really nice. Well dressed, interesting combinations and portions large enough to share. At about 10 bucks a pop, they'd better be.
And the lobster bisque was wonderful: very hot, creamy, and delicious, with noticeable chunks of lobster and the best croutons I've ever eaten floating on the top. I would have paid the freight for a side of those without a squawk.

The bread was also wonderful, very fresh and with a great chewy crumb. (Or did I just like it because it was free?)

Entrees are the usual suspects: steak, chicken, fish. Babygirl got the salmon, which was a large portion, cooked perfectly (moist but done through). The filet was fine, but UH-OH, my sister and I both ordered the rib eye, and it was extremely disappointing. I asked for rare, and explained that I meant warm red, not cold blue. No problem. I got dry brown. Figured they mixed up our orders, so she and I switched. That one was better, but still overdone. She sent the offender back, and they brought out another that was cooked less, but still hard and chewy. Reminded me of the time my old boyfriend complained to a waitress who asked about his steak that ""It was a shame they had to cut up a tire with that much tread left on it"". Amen.

Sides were a mixed bag. We really liked the asparagus and the cheesy, bacony au gratin potatoes. The macaroni and cheese was dry and kind of flavorless. Guess it was made by the same guy in charge of the rib eyes.

And my baked potato was huge, hot ,fluffy and wonderful. It would have been hard to finish it all if I hadn't kept reminding myself that the sonofabitch cost ten bucks. And I wasn't exactly stuffed full of steak.

It was my sister's birthday (at least that's what we told them), so they brought out a complimentary (Hooray!) dessert- a really pretty baked Alaska that they cut up and served to us all.

Service was fine and the ambience was pleasant enough. It would have been quite comfortable if they hadn't found it necessary to jam everyone in a not-crowded restaurant  into one small area. I thought maybe they were trying to make it easy on the wait staff, but they were squeezing between tables and brushing into customers, so I doubt they liked the arrangement either.

In conclusion, I would probably go here again, but not order steak. Not a very glowing recommendation for a steakhouse."
test_1177,"Fed up with the fake Italian Food this place offers. Ya'll are getting fooled big time in thinking this place has any resemblance to an Italian restaurant. One final attempt today was the Eggplant Parmesan Hero. Well the eggplant was a white color and there was no breading at all on that white eggplant. It was one of the worst versions of this classic I even seen and their chicken parm did equal injustice to that dish a few months back. Not sure what goes on in the back of the kitchen, but I can tell you that I didn't see any Italians back there if you get my drift. The seeded roll with mozzarella cheese became my $8 lunch. Not returning to this place and who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes for a takeout order? They just say that on the phone to give you the illusion that they are high and mighty, like a club with a line outside and no people inside. Uncle Sal's is real better up the street. Later Defalco.

Ok...white eggplant does exist, but rare. Still doesn't belong in parmesan."
test_1178,I just wanted to thank everyone at Hansen expecially Lee. It's hard to lose a loved one but it was especially hard for me to lose my newborn son. Lee helped me through this hard time and gave me some great advice. Thanks again. I'm glad that my son is home with us.
test_1179,"Just ordered 2 meals from this place.  All I can say is I probably won't order from here again.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and my son ordered the chicken Alfredo.  On a good note the food arrived at my door and was very hot.  That's the end of my good review.  First off my expectations dropped dramatically when I looked at my meal and realized that they chopped up packaged, previously frozen chicken fingers as the chicken breast.  The rest of the meal continued to meet that high standard.  The marinara sauce was flavorless and soupy.  The pasta was over done and there was too much cheese on it.  My sons meal could only be called Alfredo in that it was a white sauce.  Other than that it was also flavorless and so loose that it didn't even cling to the pasta.  I don't know how their pizza is but the lack of care and poor food product they put out for the two most expensive items on their menus does not give me confidence they can do anything well."
test_1180,"I'm so happy The Corndog Company is here in Vegas now! Hubby and I have been fans of this truck for several years. When we are in St George, UT we always look to see where the truck will be. Now we can check their schedule to see where it will be here in Vegas! The Corndog Company LV makes its way all around town. I have been going to the Food Truck Party near Total Wine on Centennial Center and when I noticed on social media that this truck would be there I had to stop by. They had a long line and you need to be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes after ordering because each corndog is hand-dipped to order and fried to perfection. The corndogs come in a couple sizes and range in price from $4-$6. Not every time, but sometimes the truck does have fried cheese sticks and you'll want to try these if they have them when you visit. The fried cheese sticks have the same delicious crispy batter as the regular corndogs, but are filled with either pepper jack or american cheeses. The corndogs themselves are really tasty. I always order mine with honey and suggest you do also. The honey is drizzled on after the corndog comes out of the fryer. I also add ketchup and mustard that's usually in coolers right outside the truck and you can add as much as you want. The people working the truck are very friendly. This truck is worth checking out and you can see their schedule on social media and sometimes they have daily specials posted there also."
test_1181,My husband is from California. We just landed and both of us were on the hangry stage. So when we got to Vegas we went straight to the Linq area. For him to get his favorite animal style burger and fries.  This is a chain and it was exactly what my husband wanted.
test_1182,"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. Just as a walk in but I got right into a chair with Ricky. Told him what I wanted, scissor trim all around, and he recommended a scissor top and trimmer side. He was right! Couldn't be happier with the service. Will be back again before Christmas. This place has taken me away from South Park Barber Shop. Half the price and a better cut."
test_1183,"I had my hair cut done by Angie and she did an awful job, I mean awful I had 11 inches taken off at first it looked good and i did not notice seeing as my hair is naturally curly then following day when i straightened my hair it was COMPLETELY UNEVEN! I have no idea how a ""professional"" can cut hair so uneven I was extremely disappointed especially since I am very careful who touches my hair."
test_1184,"Stopped in this weekend before we visited the Grand Prix race nearby.  The service was not as good as usual and we weren't greeted by a hostess and waited a few minutes to be seated.  The friendly bartender noticed us and helped us out.

We dined on the patio because the weather was gorgeous.  We waited a while at our table before a server greeted us and by the time he did come (we'd probably waited about 10 minutes) we were ready to order and anxious for drinks.  Our service was definitely lacking and not what I've come to expect here.  Although they were very busy, which I'm sure affected the service.  We didn't receive drink refills very quickly and when we did they did not add more ice.  We felt a bit rushed, and had to ask for everything we needed (more napkins, more plates, more silverware, drink refills, explanation of the sauces, etc) but all in all had a decent experience.  The yummy food made up for the lack of quality care.

The Brussel sprout nachos were divine, the skirt steak taco was delicious and my husband enjoyed his machaca and shrimp tacos as well.  I love the chips and salsa here!  This was the best batch I've had.  I could drink that stuff.  The sauces are awesome and so fun."
test_1185,"Bought a new tv 2 months ago with a 2 year warranty... Best buy would not replace it as i was told. They wanted to repair it but couldnt, so they replaced it with a new one of a smaller size and charged me 90% of the warranty.. Bottom line... I received a smaller tv and they charged an additional warranty... I will no longer shop or recommend their organization to others... This is nothing but a con job to their customers... Walmart will get my business from now on... Return policy with no questions asked.... BEST BUY IS A CON AND RIP OFF....."
test_1186,Favorite bakery. I used to travel over 20 mins just to come here for the bread. It's cheap and they usually have good customer service. Can sometimes be a bit slow. I'm pretty sure everything I've ever had from Nova's has been good.
test_1187,"This place was awesome!! I have been looking for a good pad tai place for awhile & have found it!! I ordered the traditional pad tai dish with chicken, shrimp, scallions and peanuts.  It was delicious and not too spicy! I also ordered jasmine rice, which I have had before elsewhere and have loved, but the jasmine rice didn't have much taste at this particular restaurant.  I couldn't taste the jasmine.
I went with a friend and we ordered plum wine, which was very sweet & tasty! It was a nice compliment to the pad tai dish.  Overall, this was a wonderful dinner experience, and I will most definitely return!!"
test_1188,"I highly recommend Dr. Racanelli! His dedication, enthusiasm, industry knowledge, and strong credentials are exceptional. ¬†More importantly, he is genuinely interested in his patients' needs and focused on building long-term relationships.

I tend to screen doctors/dentists thoroughly and was pleasantly surprised after my initial visit (which was great, see my other review) Dr. Racanelli took great care to understand my needs and provide detailed, intelligent feedback. ¬†My 2nd visit back today (hence this review), I had an old filling replaced. He demonstrated solid workmanship and dexterity. ¬†Painless! I look forward to my future visits with a smile!"
test_1189,Great service!  Always with a smile.  I have a sailboat there  and they constantly watch over every boat and both call and take care of any problems.  highly recommend this marina!
test_1190,"Booked through Hot Wire. Car was clean and and readily available.  Simply walked to the proper section and took any car I wanted.  Good price for a Hertz Rental and the location was at the LAS Airport .

Only drawback was that you don't deal with a person at the counter.  I used a Video Kiosk.  The agent was helpful and courteous but the sound was poor and I don't like using a phone set that probably never gets cleaned."
test_1191,The place is nice on inside. Our waitress was very friendly but slow.  Food is over priced and not very good.  All 4 in our party wasn't pleased with the food.  And I ended up with an upset stomach all night.  The Parking lot is always full but isn't for the food - they are all at the bar.  Drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go!
test_1192,One of the better locations in Brampton. The service is great. They have a couple rotational staff. They are always polite and accommodate my random orders. This location is a smaller one. But it's clean and well kept. I typically always get ring of fire with Garpar mix and an order of fries and gravy on the side. Wings anyone?
test_1193,"I've sat high, I've sat close.  It doesn't matter, there isn't a bad seat in the house.

I'm a biased reviewer as I am a die hard Steelers fan.  However, I love the way this stadium was designed.  The south end views of the rivers, hills and city are stunning.

If you're a Steelers fan you have to bite the ticket price bullet and spend a Sunday watching the black & gold here.  There's nothing quite like it."
test_1194,"J and I went to this Paradise location while we were out last night.  He'd never been to a Paraside before.  Since it was after 6pm, the OldTown Scottsdale location was closed.  But, since we had to go out to Mesa, he reminded me of the Tempe Marketplace location.  

With such a busy location, you'd think that the restaurant would be clean.  Nope.  Trash on the floors.  Dirty tables.  We had to walk around for a minute before we found a clean empty table.  J was so put off by the dirty tables surrounding ours that he got up and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager, from what J stated, was like...Yeahhhhhhhhhh..I know.  He knows his employees are doing a half assed job on keeping the dining area clean and isnt doing anything about it to make sure its clean ALL THE TIME?!

Now to the food.  

We split a Paradise Club.  It seemed as if this sandwich was just thrown together.  Very dry.  J was not at all impressed.  

I had a cup of Mac & Cheese and J had a bowl of Mac & Cheese.   Im guessing since the mac & cheese is in individual packages, they cook them in a sous vide.   J's came from a batch that had not been cooked yet.  The guy says, this ones cold, so I have to heat it up.  He then throws the cup in the microwave.  Uhhh..okay.  J said his was alright.  He had a little left over and gave me the rest of his.  Why did the mac taste chewy.  Like it had not been cooked all the way?  Though seeing the bowl being put in the microwave, I should have known something would have been off.  But I was not expecting chewy macaroni.  

After everything was said and done, I wish the OldTown Scottsdale would have been open!  Because I unfortunately don't think I'll be able to get J to step foot in another Paradise after this experience."
test_1195,"One comes in for a beer, and stays for longer than planned, finding treasures of beer and wine, sipping one of many rare beers on tap, soaking up knowledge from the ever calm Issa.

This is where beer was meant to be sold."
test_1196,"Cool atmosphere, quick friendly service, sup par pad thai. Good meat, overcooked noodles, no heat."
test_1197,I personally have a fear of going to hairdressers. I panic the whole time. They were excellent. They made me feel very comfortable. Gave me an affordable price and really went the extra mile to give me amazing hair. I really felt cared for. I recommend them!
test_1198,"Asian hot bar!  Still undergoing it's renovations, but already an inspiring update to my neighborhood HT.  The Starbucks branch inside is impressive and way bigger than I anticipated.  Clean new design and brighter lighting with wine tasting or eat in area not that we have pizza and hot bars, too.  Must hit the breakfast bar soon!  

I am so a regular here for prepared meals, and sushi that the sushi chefs always know me now!  Hope the Kroger buy means the chain won't suffer from a fall in quality.  Wait and see..."
test_1199,"Outstanding customer service, and the best water system we've ever had! Our water is noticeably softer than any of our previous systems. The installation was super fast and efficient, and Doug was very professional and honest. He inspected my R.O. system with no additional charge, and did not try to sell me unnecessary equipment when he found the R.O. to be in good shape.  I recommend this company without hesitation, and look forward to doing business with them again."
test_1200,"I ate at this location for my first Chick-Fil-A experience and I'm now a die-hard converted lover! Staff was helpful and more than willing to make accommodations for my nutritional concerns and desires for my meal. I was so happy to know that I could order a breakfast burrito by my preference with no issue (egg whites only, no cheese, with hash browns!), and the staff was more than happy to outfit me with all the sauces and accoutrements I desired. I loved the waffle fries I got, and their sugar-free lemonade was absolutely scrumptious. I cannot wait to go back!"
test_1201,"One of my favourites!

The Good Fork has turned into one of my regular haunts. 

The food is consistently delicious, service is attentive and the environment is relaxing. And the menu is regularly updated. 

Highly recommended. 

Desserts are great but I would like them to bring back bread pudding. 

Note - Cash or debit only"
test_1202,"I cannot beleive this place is still open and relatively busy... It is unedible. The food is of poor quality, the kitchen is dirty. An open kitchen should be kept clean, considering that is the first thing people look at!

The service is good, but that cannot redempt the food. I can't even understand how people think this is italian food. 

The pizza is actually not terrible, but not good either... The kind you find in a food court. 

The pasta is horrendous. The tomatoe sauce tastes like it was pre-packaged and served straight from a can. 

The appetizers were not fresh... Mozzarella was dry and the cold cuts had an unhealthy funk... I had to spit it out. Waiter did not ask why our plate remained untouched, and to be honest, I did not feel like making a big case out of it because he was so nice.

To avoid at all cost: the sausage. I don't know where that ""meat"" comes from, but I think that you can get serious food poisoning from ingesting that stuff. 

Will never go back."
test_1203,"This is the most hit-and-miss Chinese food I've had.  The dishes are static; the bad ones stay bad, and the good ones stay good.  But it's a learning curve to find ones that are good for me.  

Had I rated this yesterday, I would have went 1 star; today, after trying the (slightly salty) rice noodles and vegetable tofu soup, 2 stars.  If the rice noodles were less salty, I might go up to four stars; they were cheap and filling, and tasted pretty darn good, saltiness aside.

My coworkers seem to love the dishes I don't like, to be fair.  I think they're swamped in sauce, and I had the taste of their sesame sauce stuck in my mouth for hours.  Ew!  

It's cheap, it's fast, and it's very, very accessible to work.

edit: Okay, after some urging from coworkers, I've gone back.  And back again.  The vegetarian rice noodles aren't usually salty, and the consistency of quality is pretty sound.  Still not a fan of things with sauce here, but the coworkers still love it."
test_1204,"This place is awesome! My fav sushi spot in vegas.

It's a small family owned spot that deserves your visit. 

The butter garlic white fish and yellow tail poke tacos are my 2 go to items."
test_1205,Very nice office personnel. Good with communication and thorough about emails and reminders.
test_1206,"We came down and rented bikes for my wife and myself.  (My children had their bikes from home.)  The gentleman who helped us was extremely cordial, polite, and knowledgable.  He mapped out several routes for us to take with options that took the kids into consideration.  We had a blast riding the trails through the Southside to Station Square.  In the end we stopped for lunch and had the bikes out for 2 hours ($32 total).  After returning the bikes the man who checked us back in was very friendly and seemed generally interested in how our experience was.  I think we will have to make this an annual end of the summer thing to do.  I dont think I would go to another rental place with the experience that we had!"
test_1207,Went here for the second time and it was pretty bad. Everything was bland and one friend got sick and had to rush for the bathroom lol.
test_1208,"What the heck has happened to this place!!??  There obviously has been a conscious decision to just let this place go. The interior is in need of a renovation, the associates rarely say hi or offer help, many not friendly, many homes where product goes is empty, broken displays everywhere, missing price tags, the counters at check out and return look terrible, the place is dirty, foot traffic is way down, many off brand products, flea market toys and junk for sale up front, etc. This used to be my first location location I'd  go for any electronics, now it's the last!!!"
test_1209,"Heard about this from a co worker
 Joined by membership AND you should too. If you want to truly relax and feel your best, get a float!!! They have gift cards for those people you want to share this amazing experience. Floated today and took my husband for his first time. HE LOVED AND YOU WILL TOO"
test_1210,"Went here for a quick lunch with a colleague.  Great place.  The food was fast and fresh.  When you walk in, you are greeted by a large fish counter.  You can order your fish and take it home or have them cook it for you.  There is also a small menu you can order from and plenty of large picnic tables to sit.  I chose the fried shrimp Po Boy and my colleague had the Lowcountry Boil.  We both chose dirty rice as our side.  Mine was delicious.  The Po Boy sauce was awesome and the dirty rice was nice.  Not oily at all.  My colleagues boil was great too - 10 boiled shrimp with potatoes and corn.  Will definitely be coming back here!  Great find!"
test_1211,"Don't let the newish, plain little building fool you: Sam's has been a Bloor West institution for years, although the business used to be just off Bloor on Durie Street.

You can still get a good, workmanlike cut here for a fair price, and it's still very much a one-man operation: there's even a cute, hand-drawn ""Gone Fishin' "" sign in the window when Sam takes summer vacation (so plan accordingly if you want to get a trim in August)."
test_1212,This is my go to Thai spot!  The staff is great and the restaurant has a cozy feel.  It's BYOB and there are several spots on the street to grab good beers or wine.  If you're in Regent Square look it up!  Also great for carry out!
test_1213,Overrated and just ok food .. it was ultra expensive too.. avoid if you can... it's better just to go to the buffet at Ceasar's palace.
test_1214,"Hello, old friend. What's not to love about Sir Ed's? Seriously. They're like that old elementary school buddy you might go years without seeing but as soon as you're hanging out in the same place at the same time, it's like no time at all has passed. On our most recent visit, the first in a year, at least, I didn't even pick up the menu. Intuitively, I ordered without hesitation, ""Jerk chicken nachos, please!"" I mean, it's a no brainer. I've been eating those nachos as a late night treat for almost 15-years. 

I was living abroad when they closed temporarily. I almost bought airfare home for one last order of those nachos. Thankfully, some saint decided to revive ol' Sir Ed's not long after they closed and the late night shenanigans live on! 

Does the place have it's faults? Certainly. But, who doesn't? On those nights I'm not feeling their beer selection, I go with a proseccco. If it's too loud and somehow kinda smokey inside (even though you haven't been able to smoke inside restaurants in NC for years) I'll just hang out on the patio. Slow service? No big deal. More time to hang out with the table of friends sure to be along for the evening. 

I may see you next weekend or next year, Sir Ed's. Regardless, I know we'll hit it off as if we just saw each other the day before. No menu needed thankyouverymuch."
test_1215,"This is one of the best bangs for your buck in terms of Vegas restaurants. I really like their open faced sandwiches - I had the pastrami this time around. The portions are gigantic. The pastrami sandwich was not bad, albeit a bit more dry than what I remember it was previously. Normally, I would say the potato pancake is to die for, but this time, it wasn't very good - it was really hard and rather dry. It tasted a bit stale.

The strawberry milkshake I had was not bad, but it definitely wasn't very good - I was craving a milkshake, which is probably why I liked it more than I should have.

I'll try this place again... just a bit disappointed it wasn't so good this time around. Service was nice, but I'm not sure why they didn't bring the pickles around (we didn't feel like asking). Overall, decent place for a casual bite (with HUGE portions that you can probably share)."
test_1216,"""The CAFE"" is located in Henderson in the Water Street District right next door to the Event Center 

$5.99 specials , and everthing on the menu under 15 bucks including crab legs prime rib ,and one pound Porterhouse. 

All come with All-You-Can-Eat Soup & Salad Bar. 

Lots of Neon and big comfy boothes. A counter as well. Service was very friendly and almost TOO efficient. 

Really can't blame them not much business. The salad bar was clean, loaded and fresh.

The chicken noodle soup was savory & Fresh but a little small on the chicken. 

The salad was fresh & crisp with lots of toppings and dressings. 

The entrees were very large. The chicken fingers were crispy,juicy and spicy w/ a delicious honey mustard dip. 

The sweet potato was fluffy and hot and oh so yummy. The veggies were a little too cooked. Should have been steamed not boiled. 

The chopped sitloin was a little underdone and the gravy was kind of salty but the onions were grilled very nice & crispy. 

The potatoes were very creamy with a hint of garlic. 

The drinks were filled to the point where we were finally given 2 glasses. 

All in all for 2 people to have soup,salad bar and entree for under $22 with tip, it may be 18 miles to drive from Las Vegas but we will be making the trip again. 

We recommend you visit Henderson Water Street District. Friendly people, Cheap Prices and decent food."
test_1217,Chose this location and used their VIP service this time to watch the new Star Wars movie and holy s**t the VIP service is awesome. Table service at your seat ?! We ordered a pitcher and had some brews while getting our minds blown from the 3d visual orgasms. A bit pricy but definitely a great higher class feel to a movie for you and your date.  Next time I'd go for their Hump Date deal on Wednesday!
test_1218,"U can find this restaurant right inside the Linq casino on the Strip. This place is open early for breakfast. Service is fast and friendly. Guy Fieri is known from drive-ins and Dives, traveling around the world to taste food. Also in food network. He finally has a restaurant in vegas! Glad to try this place out. this restaurant also includes a bar and outside dining."
test_1219,"Dining at Wo Fat took me back to my youthful years. The original Wo Fat was located in downtown Honolulu. The family brought the same entrees and style of cooking the best Chinese cuisine to Las Vegas. 

Our group took up four of the large tables in the dining room. We had ginger chicken, kau yuk with buns, crispy kau gee, cake noodles with veggies, pork hash patties with and without egg, steamed rice, and a bunch of other dishes.

None in our party left the restaurant hungry. We all ate, ate, and ate. 

Definitely recommended to all ""locals"" from Hawaii that long for the ono style cooking of home."
test_1220,This place tho ! This place is so good I got two piece grilled chicken with Campero beans and lemme tell you ! Way better then el pollo loco .. they spices they use in the chicken are so good . Only complaint is that It's a little too juicy for my liking but it was good nonetheless.
test_1221,"Perhaps the best way to describe this place is consistent... consistently BAD. I have been in the somewhat unique, albeit unenviable, position to have sampled a large variety of their lunch items. From their fish tacos to burgers to various chicken and deli sandwiches, corn chowder, and smoothies, I have yet to discover something that is at least half-decent.

Perhaps, more specifics are in order. The fried fish had a cold, thick, and dried-out texture of cardboard. The greasy burgers were overcooked and had a soggy bun. The chicken is dry, lacking in flavor, and smothered with oily cheese. The corn chowder is a nasty gelatinous goo. The smoothies are extremely sweet and not as thick as they ought to be. You get the idea...  

Why would I continue to subject myself to such awful food? One of the facilities, where I work, will order lunch for us from various places if we are working through the lunch hour. I'm not completely sure who is responsible for picking the place each time, but there must be some kind of kickbacks taking place because I cannot fathom why they seem to keep picking this place over a vastly superior alternative like Tropical Smoothie Cafe.

One time, when they asked me what I wanted to order, I told them that I would pass. However, this woman felt really bad and insisted on suggesting something that I would like. I ended up ordering some sort of chicken sandwich which was, surprise surprise, terrible. The most recent time they ordered from here, to avoid hurting anyone's feelings, I just ordered some random sandwich. I took it with me when I left the facility but dumped it in the nearest trash bin. I felt bad wasting ""food"" and for a moment thought that maybe I should give it to some homeless person. Then again, if I had, they might think that I was trying to poison them."
test_1222,"this is a great italian grocery, and they have delicious prepared foods.  I love their antipasto salad!  Stop in to grab lunch or to get some authentic Italian staples for your pantry."
test_1223,"I tried the Toronto signature poke bowl and it's a bit smaller than what other places offer since they only have one size but the bowl overall wasn't that bad at all, lots of yummy fresh toppings. My friend who is vegetarian also enjoyed her bowl as well."
test_1224,"I don't give many places 5 stars, but this place deserves it. From the well planned seasonal menu to the intimate setting, it's a great place for a date or dinner with some friends ... oh and BYOB, there's no corking fee!"
test_1225,"I was getting married in Vegas, and wanted some Indian food catered for our reception. Our initial menu tasting at Origin India was so delicious. We had the Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken, rice and naan. It was really tasty. I also loved the ambiance of the place! We ended up getting lunch and dinner catered for our big day. Everyone absolutely loved the food! We got rave reviews for how great Indian food was. We are definitely gonna go back to eat at Origin India when we visit Vegas next. None of our guests were disappointed."
test_1226,"SideBar is the type of place that seems like it should be cooler than it is. Drinks are always ok. I ordered the Whiskeyberry Sour {Jameson Irish Whiskey | fresh muddled blueberries | sweet & sour} and it was pretty solid. I really hate that they don't have cocktail servers (or at least I have never been served by one) leaving you to trek to the bar to get each cocktail. It can be even more tedious if it's busy because someone in your group always has to stay back and save the seats for everyone. Maybe I am just old and crotchety or something, who knows?"
test_1227,"So here are the facts, keep in mind my reservation was set a week in advance for my 1 year anniversary, it took 30 minutes to merely get sat, 30 more minutes to get my first cocktail and starter, and then another 45 minutes after that to get my entree. All the while the large groups of 5 or more are getting sat instantly, served in minutes and catered to. We were ignored and put on the back burner because there were only 2 of us and are a younger couple. 
  I'm tired of going to a restaurant held in high regard and when we get treated like crap we get to hear excuses like, ""well, your table is saved the group before you is just hanging out though and we are double booked tonight"". (Snobby hostess that needs a reprimand for her terrible people skills and attitude.) Or, ""I'm sorry that everything is taking so long, we are just backed up and I'm not too sure why"" (Waiter trying hard to cover up for managers neglecting their patrons.) This is an acclaimed restaurant but can't keep on top of their shit on a Saturday in December? Is that a joke?
  My experience was completely unacceptable and I will never ever suggest anyone to go here simply based on principle. 
  Thanks for ruining my anniversary."
test_1228,The dessert bar was amazing and our waiter was great.  The rest of the buffet was below the quality of the Golden Coral.  We had a coupon and at $20 wasn't a bad deal overall.  They had crab legs but they were cold and not steamed.
test_1229,TI  offers two for one special with limited food to eat and bad service a very disappointment buffet not worth the money.
test_1230,"I have been to Dr. Bui's office several times over the past few months. Each time he has been sure to provide the utmost care and professionalism in providing dental services. Before each procedure the process and everything it entailed was described to me in detail (including a breakdown of the cost), which was very comforting since I have sensitive teeth and a fear of feeling pain at the dentist. Dr. Bui constantly makes sure I am comfortable and even personally calls me to follow up and make sure I am doing okay. The office appears to run smoothly, my wait time has never been more than 2 or 3 minutes once checked in. His staff are all pleasant, amazing, and professional. The office is clean and they conveniently have Netflix for pateints. I couldn't have asked for a more professional and knowledgeable dentist."
test_1231,"Friendly husband and wife owned Brazilian steakhouse. Reservation only. Large bar and wine selection made my first impression. My second impression was the odd decor (i.e. poorly pixel sail boat printed table tops). The all you can eat salad and cheese bar could use some more love, even if it's only in terms of presentation. But, of the cheese offered, they were good. The all you can eat hot food selection included: pot roast, chicken soup (too salty for my liking), chicken marsala, mashed potatoes, black beans, and 2-3 other chicken choices). Generous selection of juicy meats the owner personally grills and serves to your content and without wait. Im not sure the experience was worth the $50 Groupon for two and upgrade of $10/pp for additional premium selection of meats. Drinks and dessert not included. Without a Groupon, I would definitely pass (would have been a $100-$120 meal for two). Too expensive. I would elect for Fogo de Chao. For the same price they have better sides included with your meal: addicting cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and caramelized bananas. Moreover, they offer Guarana and limeade."
test_1232,"8/15/2017 - After leaving some negative reviews, Lorex reached out and let me know that a replacement NVR had been shipped.  Someone forgot to tell the customer service people to ship the NVR because its a week later and there is no tracking number, no NVR.  And I've been sitting on hold for 40 minutes this morning waiting to talk to someone.  

Lorex, following up with a customer and LYING doesn't really help.  You guys acknowledged the NVR was defective.  You guys received the defective NVR back.  Why don't you do the right thing and send the replacement that should have been sent 2 months ago.

9/1/2017 - Update.  Received the 3rd replacement NVR (its the one I sent back months ago) a week ago. Last night, cursor in the upper left quadrant and the software wouldn't load.  THANK GOD I bought it at Costco.  Still really upset that I'm out the installation cost of this system but at least I will be getting my $2500 for the system back.  For my replacement security system, I'm calling the technical support line first and seeing how long it takes to get through.  Also thinking about putting 2 16 camera systems in instead of 1 32 camera system.  Might have been too much for the NVR to handle."
test_1233,"Food is ok for the price, but ""fills you up"" is probably the best way to describe it.  Based on the fact that this is a tiny place situated in a commercial offices building, I guess they're doing their job to feed the office folk during lunchbreak.  But just barely."
test_1234,"My daughter is getting married, we like most people went over to David's Bridal and well the lack of customer service made us rethink our choice. We had remembered that there was a bridal shop on Baseline & Dobson and thought we would go check it out. We were greeted by Sarah right when we walked into the door and even though at that time my daughter's wedding wasn't for another 2 years Sarah was more then willing to help us out. When we walked in we saw this dress and I knew that was the dress, but my daughter wanted to look around, Sarah helped her find styles and try on dresses, but when she tried on the one we 1st saw, we knew that was the dress! Its soo breathtakingly beautiful and when my daughter came out to show us my other daughter started to cry which got me started LOL. My daughter didn't even want to take the dress off, needless to say the wedding is now a year away and we can hardly wait for her groom to see her in the dress!! I would and do recommend Brilliant Bridal to everyone who is looking for a wedding dress!"
test_1235,"Came here because 5 and Diner was having ""maintenance issues""?? Quick bite in between shopping. Seating was slow. Sat for about 10-15 minutes before asking Martina if a server was coming. After letting us and another sever know that she didn't know where our server was she did take our order quickly. Food came out fast, drinks were filled and tasted fine. Martina did a great job! She also offered us drinks to go. Bathroom was yuck , dirty and toilet paper all over!"
test_1236,"I love this casino as it has everything from casino, spot machines, great services, canal, one of the highly recommend place for all gambling folks specially those who love to play table as well as slot, good payouts, great staff, drinks were awesome, one should try his/her luck at least once, loved it!"
test_1237,"The Big Sur Oyster Bar is located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino, just a 10 minute drive from the Strip.

We started off with the New England Clam Chowder which was really nice and hearthy; with big chunks of potatos and clams.

Next, We had the Louisiana Oysters.  These suckers were plump, juicy and flavorful.  We gave them a nice soaking of lemon juice, a dab of horseradish and cocktail sauce.  

**Warning**  The waitress warned us not to go too crazy with the horseradish because it packs a punch.  And she wasn't kidding.  My buddy Alan was the first victim.  He had a nice big chunk of horseradish work his head over. Alan grimaced like he just sucked down a 64oz Big Gulp in 5 seconds.  I was the next, as I caught a chunk hitting directly at the back of my throat, sending a nice burning shot to my face.  No, i'm not crying...  Man, that was some good stuff.  I had to mix in some of that stuff into the chowder.

Lastly, we had the Soft Shelled Crab Po Boy.  And that sandwich did not disappoint.  The soft shelled crab was big and meaty.  Plus the batter crust was awesome.  I could of downed a few of these bad boys alone, without the rest of the sandwich.

We got to sit at the bar area, so we watched the chefs working away right in front of us.  Most of the stuff looked really good.  We saw them cook up a couple batches of Oyster Rockafellers.  Oh man, we should of got some of those.  For sure next time!!

Great food at decent prices.  Time for some poker."
test_1238,"The Peppermill feels like a truly Las Vegas experience! Anyplace else in the world and this place would be quite out of place but in LV, it's freaking perfect! Neon all over the place and kitschy as hell! (In a good way) I know all the reviews talk about this but I can't stress this enough: the portions are huge!! If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive. That being said, I'd definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurant/lounge is just too kitschy/glitzy/vegasy (is that a word?) not to love."
test_1239,"I went to David's Tea for a workshop and the staff (2 young ladies), were so accommodating! It was perfect to do my mandala coloring with a nice warm Irish Breakfast tea. The lighting there is great. Thank you David's Tea for hosting the group!"
test_1240,"I went to see Dr. Romo. She was nice and very helpful while I was there in the office, but out of the office that wasn't the case. I had called her with some questions that needed to be answered soon and when she didn't call me back the next day I called again and I also sent an e-mail. A week later she still hadn't called. So I called her again and she texted me back to let me know she couldn't help.

This wasn't the first time I experienced this with Dr. Romo. I had sent her an e-mail in June that was incredibly time sensitive and important, this was after calling her weeks before with no reply. It was about a bill that she told me I wouldn't be charged for in the first place. And when I was charged she said she would try to help fix it. Finally, I went into the office a few days after I'd sent the email and she said she could help because she had a medical representative friend she could speak with. Well, it's September and still no update...and like I said, this was time sensitive. So I called once more, and she texted me back saying that I have to talk to a representative myself and that she has no control. Couldn't she have told me that 3 months ago? If I was going to be charged she shouldn't have said I wasn't. If she couldn't help she shouldn't have said that she could. Did she even try? I have no idea, but I know I won't be going back.

I felt like they didn't care, I wasn't their priority. The ladies at the help desk were quite standoffish. This definitely isn't where I want to go to feel safe, taken care of, helped, and healthy.

Wouldn't recommend it."
test_1241,"I have gone to Dr. Berelowitz since I was 12 years old (I am now 28!). He did move away for a few years, but I was SO happy when he came back to town. He cares about his patients and is very thorough. I know the wait-list is long for him, but that jsut shows how amazing he is. I have had a few endocrinologists since I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 26 years ago, and he is by far the best endo and doctor I have ever had."
test_1242,"Pizza delivery was fairly fast,
(more like it arrived exactly when I expected it to, which is great)
This was my first time ordering so I was skeptical. So glad I ordered, I just moved here from NY and this is the best pizza I've gotten since my move! 

Amazing, ***** always ordering pizza from you guys! Stay open later!"
test_1243,"Love it! Excellent service, fast and fresh food. The young female server there is a total sweetheart and always makes me feel at home."
test_1244,"Seems like a older crowd some nights when it is less busy, but overall pretty diverse group. When it's nice out, the patio out front is everything. Never had a problem getting a drink, service is great."
test_1245,"A colleague recommended this place, as I was looking for some different food. I have to say I was not disappointed at all, the food was delicious!!.. And very exotic!!.. The place is not fancy, so I just order to go. But this food was definitely great!!.. I recommend it 100%."
test_1246,"I've been coming here for a couple years now and the food is really good.The staff is friendly very friendly(thank you guys!) But let me tell you about this ""manager"" jerry. He is a joke!!!, very rude and inconsiderate. This ""man"" has no respect or manners for his guests, honestly I will not be returning here if this p.o.s is still working here. Anna is amazing .. She should be running this show :)..."
test_1247,"We headed over to Dilworth to eat at Lebowski's the day after Christmas only to have our hopes dashed when it was closed.  Luckily, Cantina 1511 was open across the street.  And as a Mexican food snob, I can safely say that Cantina has the best salsa I've had since I left San Diego.  Spicy without being too spicy, flavorful, and good consistency to adhere itself to the chip.  I now regret not trying their guac.  Decent food overall.  But man, that salsa!  Start bottling it."
test_1248,"I've never had a bad meal at Mozza. That, to me, is a great start! I'm always willing to give a restaurant a second and third try if the first experience isn't great, but I'm glad to say that I've been to 3 different Mozzas and they've all been equally good (consistency is key!) and I love the ambiance of this one in particular. 

Went here for lunch yesterday, probably my 10th visit to this particular restaurant, and ordered the Siciliana pizza with an additional topping of crumbled Italian sausage. It has thick, fat, salty, juicy Tuscan olives on it that were to die for, and the sausage (extra $4) really made the pizza that much better (IMHO). 

My go-to pizza is usually the Rucola (an insane amount of arugula and some prosciutto & cheese), but I wanted to mix it up yesterday. My friend ordered the Nonno Angelo, which had anchovies on it (soooo not my thing!) and he ate the whole pizza up in like 5 minutes. He loved it! 

In the past, I've enjoyed the arancini to start, but yesterday I tried the parmigiano French fries cause I wanted something small. They were yummy, but stick to the regular appetizer list for an appie when you order. I've tried most of them and they've all been good. 

One awesome thing is they now have Moretti beer on tap!! Woot woot! Bottoms up!"
test_1249,"Came in Friday 10/24/14. Got there before it opened because of what I've read on previous yelp reviews. Once we got in I waited for about an hour ,but it was totally worth the wait. I got my cut by Martin. Told him what I wanted even showed him some pics and he nailed it! I've gotten several compliments since. They don't rush it . Will definitely come back soon!"
test_1250,Great food!!! The pork gyro is amazing! Staff is friendly! I work close by and all the guys really go above and beyond! So happy to have great food close to work!
test_1251,"Used to be an awesome practice when he first opened!  I was one of his first customers in those early months. 

Yeah I didn't love the quote system... it was high pressure.  That's changed to more of here's the quote do it or don't do it. 

I'm not sure I needed all the services I received but I did them since I had insurance.  The last was a crown and it's been about 5 months and the root is still sore, so I have to use Ambesol to numb to floss.

Told my daughter she needed invisalign when she'd already seen TMJ Specialist he referred her to and she'd been through whole process.

Free whitening gimmick wasn't really free.

I've become disappointed that they talk about other patients in front of me... not by name but hygienists are mouthy and need coached it's unprofessional.

They go through hygienists like tissues... one you like disappears. 

One time I had to wait almost 2 hours for my appointment because some business guy came in early... so I got bumped.  Well it made me late for work and my business meetings, so I was not really happy about that!

Even with insurance my family has paid thousands of dollars for services from fillings to root canals.

I think I need to look around for someone new."
test_1252,"Yay!!!! So glad this location is finally open!!!!! Being from Vegas I grew up eating at Metro Pizza. Who from here didn't?!?!  The pizza is so darn good that we would drive across town to the Flamingo or Trop location because it tasted that good. So, to have one after all these years right in the neighborhood is just such a bonus!

I will say this. The parking is odd. They have 2 separate doors. One is for take out orders and the other is for being seated inside the restaurant to eat. It isn't well marked so either door could look like either door. We parked near the take out and were eating inside. We needed a handicapped spot. The curb you step onto from the parking lot to go inside is very high. Please be careful of this anybody could easily trip and fall. I believe it could be meant to be a ramp for wheelchairs but when walking you have no choice but to step over it and it could easily be missed if your talking or looking around.

The inside is huge! There were tons of staff hustling around inside. They have a bar so you can just pop in for a drink or even have a drink before being seated or waiting on someone. There is a hostess stand where you wait to be seated and we were greeted and seated right away. A moment later a bread basket was dropped off at the table. Yum! The server came to take our drink orders and she was very friendly, nice and took great care of us. 

We ordered some ""Garlic Knots"". Delish!  They have meatball sliders that I have had in the past and they use the garlic knots for the bread you should give those a try!

I had the ""South Side"". It is a stuffed pizza and SO good! It has 3 cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta, romano) and came with a side of sauce. I love their sauce! I ordered the individual size but let me tell you it is so stuffed with cheese that this is a sharable or a take home for another meal kind of a pizza! 

The inside is very clean. The moment after someone leaves they are wiping down the tables and everything on it. 

They have a monthly calendar that has daily specials. You can get one inside any restaurant or directly from there website. You can also follow them on facebook.

We were very pleased and will for sure be back!"
test_1253,"I've been going to here for years, and went to the previous location for many years as well. I recently moved so I'm not by there anymore, but when I'm in town I'll be going back for a haircut."
test_1254,Great place to get your hair/beard done. The guys there make you feel like your a regular even though I was an out of towner. Now part of my regular Vegas routine.
test_1255,"Meh. I liked some things; I disliked some things. Perhaps I'm not that cultured an eater. It was a special meal, for sure, and it's special to eat fish flown in from other countries, but the food was not justified by the price tag, in my opinion. For very high end sushi, I think I prefer Sushi Kaji."
test_1256,"Great service, great (bar food). This area needed Blue 32 bad. I've brought my family here around 6 times, only had one bad experience that came from a inexperienced hostess had had us wait over 25 minutes."
test_1257,"Came back to Woo Che recently on a Friday after we thought the $17 price was more reasonable compared to Sura ($24). Well, I was wrong because we were charged $19 per person that night.

When we first walked in the door, the place was almost deserted. There were only one other table (4 people) beside. When we left, we noticed only one more group came in after us and basically they were the only one there after we left. This is depressing for a late Friday night dinner joint.

Once we started eating the food, we realized why the place was almost empty. There weren't a lot of choices in term of food when compared with Sura. Most of the cooked food have been sitting out for a long time and didn't look fresh. The meat quality was low and again looked like it has been sitting out for a while. Overall the food experience were not good.

The service was nice, but again it could be because there were only a few people there. I felt bad for them because this place looks like it will have to close shop soon. I don't think you can maintain a business when only a few people dined at your joint on a Friday night. I hope I'm wrong and they will be successful again, so that way Sura don't have the monopoly and keep jacking up the price."
test_1258,Can't complain about free....stunning and weather was just right (early May 2015) we went at about 2100 and you could enjoy lighting. Every 15 mins a new song and show
test_1259,"This place is nothing more than really Americanized and not so good Asian food.  Fusion--ha!  If you mix crap with crap you still have crap.

I had the duck with plum sauce--greasy with mushy skin (should be crispy).  Plum sauce was essentially flavorless duck sauce (not sauce for duck, but that sweet apricot sauce that comes in those little packets).  Served with stale rice without any aromatics.  Heck, minute rice has more flavor.  

If the food was even 1/2 as good as frozen Chinese food from my grocery store, then the price would still be too high.  

Only plus was that our server was friendly.  

Hard Rock--give this place a hard kick out of your casino!"
test_1260,"This store NEVER has anything in stock,I don't care what you want this store wont have it in stock.The Manager needs too be let go and they need too get someone that can order some  product."
test_1261,"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!"
test_1262,"Food is good. Great pulled pork and guac. The Margs are NOT modern, and use the same sweet and sour they use in Minnesota. The service is habitually slow and unattentive. Definitely go to get some beers and tacos. Just don't be in a hurry."
test_1263,"He said, "" WOW...let me say that again...WOOOOOOOOW. This place was amazing. They did almost loose a star because we had dinner reservations at 545 and they didn't sit us down until almost 6. One more minute and we were knocking off a star. So our waiter was great. He recommened the bone in filet migon and the creamed corn. This meal was better than any other meal I ever had...I had the lamb chops crusted with pine nut rosemary in au jus....this was the best food ever. The lamb just fell off the bone. If you never had lamb...try it here...you will love it. Now for the two other sides we got ..the mac and cheese and the creamed corn. The mac and chees was better than any other place. You could tell it was made from scratch. We spent 240 for the both of us and I would of paid up to 400 for this food. Our price included a 60 dollar bottle of wine. If you don't like the younger crowd of vegas don't go spend too much time in the Palms because this place is not for the elderly. By the way something weird..all the waiters but one were dudes..and the army of hostess were all girls...they probably had like 10 of them....if you love steak make sure you eat here.""

She said, ""Totally agreeing with my boyfriend on this one. This place went above and beyond any resturaunt i had ever eaten at. The atmosphere, service and food was all awesome. I didnt even mind waiting a little bit before we were seated because they have comfy seats and a flat screen you can wait at. Also, its closed off to the casino so you can eat privatley. The waiter suggested the 16oz bone in fielt mignon and lamb. It was amazing, the steak was the best steak i had ever eaten and im glad my first time trying lamb was here. We didnt plan on going here, we were actually planning going to switch, but after reading yelp reviews we decided to ditch switch and go here instead. Such a good decision. We will def be back to eat here."""
test_1264,"Let me just start off by saying that this was my first time getting gel nails, so I don't really have much of a basis for comparison, but I was personally very impressed! 

If you're hoping for a calm, relaxing, spa-like environment, this is not the place for you. It's small, cramped, and noisy. None of this matters to me however, as long as I get a good product.

I was about 20 minutes late for my appointment as I got stuck in extremely heavy traffic, but the ladies were very kind and accommodating, which was a wonderful way to start. I got there and I really didn't have any idea of what I wanted. Their samples were all cute, but weren't what I was looking for, so I showed them a picture off of yelp and asked if they could do that for me, but in different colours. You bet they could. They offered me drinks and then the lovely technician (I believe her name was Helen) set to work. She was very attentive, ensuring the shape and length were good, and making sure to remind me to tell her if the filing drill thingy (sorry, I'm a noob) got too hot. She was friendly and kind, and best of all, she really seemed to know her stuff. She was quick, and skillful, and seemed to really take pride in her work. She really took her time to get all of the fine details just right, and I ended up with a beautiful end result. Like I said, I don't have much basis for comparison, except what I've seen of other peoples' nails, and frankly, I don't think I've ever seen any better than what I got LOL! Maybe I'm just biased. 

One more thing, when I went to pay, the gentleman who helped me (I'm assuming the owner) told me that they can do almost anything if you bring in a picture. Even like that super fancy 3-D stuff. If you decide to do that sort of thing though, make sure you're very clear about that on the phone, because he said it will take probably around 4 hours to do something like that. Also, it'll probably add a chunk to the price haha. 

Anyway, that was my experience. I will absolutely recommend them to friends, and I'll definitely be going back for all of my nail needs."
test_1265,"As a tennis pro, I have hundreds of clients ask me about racquets, string, grips, bags, shoes and gear.  I have a simple answer ""All About Tennis"".  If you live in Phoenix metro area or are visiting the ""Valley of the Sun ""on vacation, you need to check out this store!  They have the widest selection of brands and inventory anywhere in the Southwest.  It's a lot of fun just checking out all the old racquets hanging on the walls....brings back memories of tennis over past 40 years!  Also, great racquet demo program and fast stringing, which always pleases my clients.  Feels good to support locally owned store vs big box or online retailers.  No, I wasn't paid, nor am I endorsed by ""All About Tennis"".  I just appreciate a well run store that serves the sport  well."
test_1266,"My dog loves camp.  She is ready at the door when it's camp day.  The camp counselors are friendly and you can tell they enjoy working with the dogs.  

We have a high energy German Shepherd, she gets to run and socialize with other dogs and bark and go play.  When she comes home she is excited and barks telling us about her day then comes the plop - she is worn out."
test_1267,"Came here on a Sunday and had the pint and pie for $15. We chose the mushroom pesto pizza to share and it was really good. Loads of flavour, plenty of cheese and a nice thin crust. We also got a happy hour cheese and meet board which wasn't very exciting. Overall we really enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back for the pizza. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly but the food and drink were quite slow to arrive. It was busy though which was nice on a Sunday evening."
test_1268,Very helpful and courteous but more importantly they provide amazing service at outstanding prices! Honesty is huge and we've always experienced that!
test_1269,"Eddie the Server provided outstanding customer service! Provided insight on the menu and recommended food options that we (7 of us) enjoyed! For the LGBT community, ask for Eddie! Took care of us 7 queens!! Ask for the Jalape√±o Popper burger for a kicking dinner before a stroll to the Fruit Loop!!!"
test_1270,"On Aug. 10, 2015 we enjoyed breakfast at our favorite Eggworks in Las Vegas.  Victoria, our server, was just the most enjoyable besides the food.  She cleaned tables, all with such good attitude.  She is probably one of the best servers we've had in the three locations we frequent.  She definitely could go a long way in restuarant management, food service industry.  Her outgoing, happy personality is a winner!!"
test_1271,"Finally,  a well cooked thin pizza!  It's been my holy grail for years in the east valley.  Delicious with plenty of toppings, crisp flavourful crust and a tangy sauce ( I loath sweet sauce).  Oh,  and delivery was prompt and courteous!  I can't wait to dine in and to try the subs. My fiance is a meatball sub fanatic and I've heard great things.  My new favorite go-to pizza place.  Bye bye Venezia pizza with your soggy, nasty crust."
test_1272,"No stars. Serious problem here. Went to get a cart when an young associate was locking some carts up outside He told us go over there across the way to get one over there. Inside the store a young woman working there had no idea what a water filter pitcher was. Another associate told her they were back by the wall where the microwaves were. No one assisted us to find the product. The product wasn't there. Terrible customer service, seemed there was no training or supervision of employees."
test_1273,"If you've ever lived in another city with ancient and archaic arenas stepping foot into T-Mobile Arena will be an amazing experience. My first visit was for UFC 216 which happened less than 1 week after the 1 October incident. Even with enhanced security the lines to pass through the metal detectors were short and the list of prohibited items was clearly displayed. And security did their jobs thoroughly without any attitude which is appreciated. 

Once you step inside you'll find wide, uncluttered concourses and clear and concise signage to help you find your seat quickly. When I had a question I had no trouble finding a staff member and they were friendly and helpful. 

And once you have a seat you'll find that compared to some arenas T-Mobile has a slight bit more leg room...it may not seem like there's much but if someone has to pass by you to get to their seat and they have their hands full there's just enough space for them to pass and not trip on people's feet or the seats. And the steps are wide enough and spaced appropriately to help avoid a tipsy / vertigo effect that some arenas have. 

Sight lines to the arena floor are very good. I'm not exactly short and the seat banking was enough that for once the people behind me didn't complain about the tall guy in front of them blocking the view. And the audio quality is definitely a step up from many venues I've been in. It's loud but very clear regardless of if it was a fighter's entrance music being played or Bruce Buffer's voice announcing the winner of the match!

Concessions: Yeah, they are pricey. Ridiculously so. But from buying food to picking up a UFC T-Shirt the lines moved quickly, and I got ""Service with a smile"" and I always like that when it happens! 

Restrooms: Yeah there's always lines, but the lines were short. And I didn't have to wait 15 minutes for my wife as she was able to get in and out quickly, and she said the restrooms were actually clean. Compared to other venues this is definitely a much better experience. 

Parking: I know locals loved free parking but you can kiss that goodbye. MGM makes it easy to go online and pay for parking in advance and get a discount if you order at least 24 hours ahead of the event. Print out your receipt, come to the event, and the parking staff makes it easy to get into the parking garage. I'll go so far as to say this was the best parking experience I've had at any arena, stadium, or large event that I've ever been to! Once you're in the garage just look up as any open parking spaces are marked with a green light. It makes finding a space so easy! And exiting was just as easy as it took less than 10 minutes from when we left the parking space to being back out on the street and heading for I-15! 

In short, T-Mobile definitely reflects the latest and greatest in arena design, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into the overall visitor experience. 4 Stars. (IMHO T-Mobile blows Mandalay Bay's arena and the MGM Grand Garden out of the water...it's superior in every way to those venues)."
test_1274,Cute little place. Mom and pop and very cozy.  Great for date night. The food is fresh and tasty. The menu is different each day is how I understand. It's what's up on the black board. The service is good. And overall the restaurant is Not trying to hard.
test_1275,It was really good. Totally hit the spot. I did the extra shot. I didn't need it though it was a bit too strong halfway through
test_1276,"Hookah Bookah is one of the more popular hookah spots in Pgh. The crowd can be a little collegey but I wouldn't say that it's unfriendly to those past the college scene.

It's a clean, well-maintained space. They have screens placed through the place, sometimes with sports or arabic music videos playing. During the summer, they also offer outdoor seating, which is nice and relaxing.

The staff are competent but the service can be rather slow at times. The prices are pretty expensif (usually $12-$15 per pipe) but the flavors are good and the hookahs 'hit' pretty well.  

Still, as compared to the outrageously bad service at Sphinx, I would still rather choose Hookah Bookah."
test_1277,"My family loves this place; while it's always busy and I would recommend making a reservation if you're more than 4 people, the service and food are forever on par!  Very consistent and great place for traditional fair."
test_1278,"checked ave b out for brunch last weekend due to the great yelp reviews and was (not-surprisingly) happy with the choice.

we got the huevos rancheros and kobe burger and both were very good, but not amazing. the french-press coffee, atmosphere, and service was however amazing.

i feel confident that dinner here would be 4 or 5 stars, and hope to be able to update next time i am in pittsburgh."
test_1279,"Where do I begin? I was admitted in their inpatient program for 7 days for Suicidal thoughts and PTSD. Within those 7 days my wife brought me over 100 dollars in magazines and books to read which the staff lost and wouldn't return her calls to get the refund. Now it's been over a month and not one of the 16 phone calls and 8 emails were returned. Then I started the outpatient program that I wasted 30 days of my life at for Clai the therapist to say She can't treat PTSD and that I just need to get my shit together. Oh and FYI this was after she told me she has a good bullshit meter and that they knew of the suicidal thoughts I had the night before. How she has a job I will never know!! Hope if you are having issues like I have then you will not go there. You may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week. Clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist. I am active duty military and there are a few others in that program if you can't help ptsd, depression, or suicidal thoughts then you need to resign before you make someone kill themselves. She is going to get someone hurt or worse. If this is how they treat military than by all means brothers and sisters stay away!!!!! Luckily I have a wonderful wife to help who is helping me find the help I need.           
UPDATE**** I will never contact this dick face that commented. You guys could give two shits about military and Clai is going to get someone killed."
test_1280,Richard and his people are fantastic.  The communication is fast and accurate.  I have used two other management companies over the past 15 years.  These guys are the best.  They are quick on the turnovers and they find respectful tenants.
test_1281,Nice atmosphere. Kid friendly. Love the rib nights. Reasonable prices.
test_1282,"Contrary to what my previous review said, this one will in fact be my last review. There are many good things about this place. It's clean, employees are generally friendly, customer service is fantastic. Kevin, a co-owner, got back to me about every complaint I've ever made. Directly or indirectly, he knows what people are saying and he's happy to correct it. On my last visit the other co-owner even came to talk to me about my previous review and how they could make it better.

But there are also things that aren't so great. Now before I say what they are I just want to disclose that I've only ever been to three nail salons so this may be par for the course and I'm just a picky bitch. When I walk in and tell the receptionist what services I'm looking for, my hope is that I'll be put with a technician who does that thing. I'm trusting in these people to know what they're doing even if I haven't made an appointment. This trust is lost here. 

If you're going MAKE an appointment and ask that person who the best person for whatever service you want is. I found someone and will be going back to Urban Nails. My last visit was fantastic. My only gripe is that my Shellac is once again peeling after only a week. I'm starting to think it's more the fault of the product than the technician though.


With all these reviews you'd think I was talking about a heart surgeon!


May 28, 2012
Laugh out loud at Victoria M's review calling out my review - yes what I said in my reviews did happen, no exaggeration. And obviously I did talk to the ladies doing my nails. My Shellac nails have: bubbled AND CHIPPPED. They were on my hands, you'd think I'd know what my eyes can see on my hands. I still go here once in awhile. It's a decent enough place. Just make an appointment after you find someone good."
test_1283,"I really enjoy the concept at 800 Degrees. You walk in and pick a ""base"" for your pizza... typically that consists of a sauce or oil, cheese, and base herbs/spices. After that you mosey on over to the topping selections and pick what you want on your pie. It's like the Chipotle of Pizza. Once you've decided on your toppings, your pie is whisked away to the oven to cook at 800 degrees. Pretty simple, quick and delicious!

I have typically gone with the Margherita base on the traditional crust and have yet to be disappointed. All of the ingredients are fresh and packed with plenty of flavor. Even the parmesan cheese is grated fresh for you and they make their own red pepper flake sauce to use as an alternative to crushed red peppers. Just enough extra kick to take your 'za to the next level! The Caesar Salad is pretty delicious as well! 

Everything moves pretty quickly here and the atmosphere is very open and bright - a really fantastic lunch spot if you find yourself on the south end of the strip."
test_1284,"Very good service, the food was very fresh, very neat setting.  1 pizza was plenty for the wife and I for lunch."
test_1285,"Had a taro milk tea with boba here. Very tasty, well priced, and boba texture was just right. No grainy, hard or soggy boba pieces at all!"
test_1286,Satisfying meal.  I had halibut & chips.  Very tasty and the fries were simple & straight forward good. Friendly owners.  Will definitely head back.
test_1287,"The most affordable form of entertainment for a family with 3 kids.  I think that if the owner catered to moms in the summertime with lots of kids movies the theatre would be packed.  Advertise to the MOMS groups in the valley, and I think people would show up.  The theatre is comfortable, but not as updated as the new ones out there.  My family and I usually go there 3 times a month.  We would go every weekend if they showed more kid movies.  Overall, I like it alot."
test_1288,"Meh.  Was there for lunch and service was great, however the sushi was just ok.  Great space, which is always misleading in Vegas.  The awesome space sometimes doesn't equal the quality of the food."
test_1289,"Very great gluten free options and delicious. There was pizza, pasta, appetizers, wedgies, hoagies, chicken fingers, beer/cider and they had some Gluten free desserts from the Gluuteny bakery across the street (which is also amazing). Quaint environment with nice bathrooms just incase that is imoortsnt to you.  The staff are all very kind and care about you. The only complaint we have was our food came out separate and from the first to our last person there was about a 7-10 minute difference. There were only 4 of us at the table. But the quality and taste of the food was well worth the wait so it wasnt that big of a deal and we enjoyed eachothers company"
test_1290,"The senora and I decided to stop by after talking a walk through town. We were seated right away and looked at the menu. They have a lot of Tequilas to chose from if you want to enjoy sampling shots. The Margarita list was suave too. I had a special Margi and the senor had a Mojito. Both were very tasty. 

The food was fine, not great but very good. We decided to sample tacos. Each of the choices were pretty good and the dish came with rice and beans. It's a nice place to stop and enjoy tasty drinks."
test_1291,Excellent food with a lot of healthy options. Excellent service too
test_1292,"Adequate sushi but nothing great.

Slightly pricey, food was good to okay. If you're looking for something different in Strongsville then try it. Be prepared for $75 for dinner and drinks for two.

Service was good but not noteworthy. Sushi was better than the hibachi."
test_1293,"Shad sold my sister a truck and I was there through the entire process as it was her first time buying. I'll be honest, we hit up the bigger dealerships first before coming across this gem. The major dealers were a waste of time. Shad got my sister a lower interest rate than ANY of the major dealers could with the same credit score and cash down. She was able to get a truck with lower miles for a better price too! We also didn't have to spend all day here doing paperwork and there was no pressure to buy. Shad and All Autos Direct are honest, reliable and all around great. Best car dealer customer service in town. You'll see!"
test_1294,"We've been to Bottiglia for both dinner and brunch quite a few times.  We really like to come on Tuesday for dollar oysters. 

 The design is very beautiful and its so nice to look around especially during the day with the beautiful outdoor area. 

I think the quality for the price is actually pretty reasonable.   Sure do we always get the best and most top notch quality?   No.   But for the most part we do.  Keep this in mind for oyster Tuesday.  You won't get huge oysters for this special but they're not bad either.

I've also never had bad service here.   Everyone that I've experienced had been friendly and knowledgeable.

Overall, a great night out."
test_1295,"Ace car rental is not inside the airport. Their is a second shuttle which takes you to the car rental site. The shuttle driver said it is a free shuttle yet my on my receipt i noticed that they charged me a shuttle fee. The customer service agent I dealt with told me I had to get the Ace additional insurance cause I didn't have a copy of my full coverage insurance policy. I had rented cars with other companies and never needed a copy of my insurance. She proceeded to inform me that if I didn't opt for Ace's insurance that I would have to continue to pay for the car daily until my insurance company and Ace hashed out any damages. I booked my car through Expedia and Ace's prices were cheaper, but when you factor in the second shuttle and the additional insurance they basically forced me to get, I wish I would have used a more reputable company."
test_1296,"CAUTION! We walked in here because of the excellent rating and had an awful, awful experience.  If that's not enough for you read on...
My 13 year old daughter had very long hair and asked Carol to cut between an inch and an inch and a half off the ends.  When she was finished I hurried to get out of the store because of the aggressive up selling going on - apparently Carol had been offended by the ""terrible chlorine smell"" of my daughters hair (even though we had not been swimming in days) and the only way to fix it is with their clarifying shampoo.   
As soon as I got in the car my daughter began to cry she said something wasn't right Carol had cut into her bangs where she knew she should not have.  Once we got home she put her hair in a ponytail and I distracted her until it was time to go to her karate class, at the class another mom & I were looking at the end of it and from across the room you could see long pieces on the side and an odd shorter straight inch or so in the middle.  When we got home and she had taken a shower we took a look at what had been done - at that point I suggested we go back that's when we met Brittany who described the cut to another stylist as ""a layer and other weirdness going on""  The photo of the hair on the floor shows the additional length that had to be taken off to try to fix it.  The other photos are AFTER it was ""fixed""
I held back on writing this review because I really felt Brittany did her best to turn the situation around I would like to think her cuts turn out better when they are hers from the start.  At this point I filled out the survey and explained what had happened - after several back and forth calls I spoke with Donna the Senior district leader for Supercuts who basically offered an apology and that was all.  Now this conversation was two days after the first cut and I had finally taken my daughter to a professional stylist for a third cut.  I am floored that Donna felt I should have let a third stylist of theirs attempt to do what the first one should have.  That was it, I was basically scolded ""I wish you hadn't gone to someone else to fix it"". A patronizing corporate apology with no intent to refund not so much as the original Charge. 
Do Not Go Here.  It will cost you far more time and money in the long run."
test_1297,"Very disappointed in my experience. I chose to buy from purple orchid based on the reviews below. The flowers were for my mom for Mother's Day. Spent $120 on and received a subpar arrangement. The store owner was helpful in trying to rectify my complaint, advising that the vase my mom chose was not good for the flowers and that she would b pleased to create an arrangement suited to that vase. Nonetheless, the sparse arrangement originally sent was not at all what you would expect for the money spent. Picture to follow."
test_1298,"At first I was slightly conflicted.  Do I write a review for HTC or Halo?  

Being that Glen and Kelsey have done all my piercings, albeit back in the day while still with HTC, I have only used Halo for new jewelry and stretching...but then it dawned on me...Glen and Kelsey were the reason I went to HTC in the first place.  They are also the reason why I go to Halo now for any further needs as well as recommend Halo to anyone I know who is interested in getting pierced.

Therefore, Halo it is...

I don't do things half-assed.  I research.  I inquire.  I am safety conscious.  I have no issues paying for higher quality products and customer service.  I also believe in loyalty when the situation deserves it.  I believe in supporting entrepreneurs.  I believe in Glen and Kelsey.

They have done all my piercings...in fact Kelsey was just an apprentice for my first.  She did an expert job then as she does now.  In fact, I think Glen has only done one for me but I know the two are essentially interchangeable.

They have the highest quality jewelry available.  They have interesting pieces as well as the old stand-by classics.  They believe safety and knowledge of the process is of paramount performance for the customer.

They have excellent recommendations as well go above and beyond for making sure the customer is happy.

Honestly, if you are researching a place to go...place your trust with these two.  If I do anymore I'd come back to Phoenix just to have them do the work.

You can't go wrong here and Halo (Glen and Kelsey) set the gold standard on what/how a piercing shop should be."
test_1299,Few days ago we bought  chicken tamales.  They are so good and tasty.  But the problem is we payed $5.25 for 3 and I wasn't happy cause they were to small.  Literally really small.  They were $1.50 and it was a perfect size.  Not to happy at all.  Don't mind paying $1.75 but for the right size.
test_1300,"I just found Las Vegas' best kept secret. The vibe at Vintner Grill is old glam Hollywood where white leather sofas, dark Old English bar, art deco chandeliers, and dimly lit candles meets crystal floor lamps. white linens, black and white classic movies and a wine list and menu featuring fabulous picks what more can I ask for?  Phew-I'm outa breath! Ambiance Ambiance! However, with that being said, it did lack some jazzy background music which would have been the perfect touch.

I recommend you dress to impress and request a table in the main dining room so you get the whole experience and people watch.  We were tucked away near the cozy wine cellar where it was quiet but I did miss the table candle and some movie watching. There is some outdoor seating complete with fire-pit and twinkling lights too.  If you don't want a table the bar section is also a roomy option to sit and have dinner or a cocktail.

On this night we were out celebrating Kate's birthday so we started off with some refreshing libations that were featured on the menu. I chose my usual Lemon Drop Martini.  I always request it a bit more sweeter that sour. Pear martini, grapefruit vodka and a fresh ginger vodka concoction was served up in a copper mug for our party of four.

The menu changes a bit with the seasons and that's always a good thing. For starters we chose a fabulous Charcuterie.  The wonderful thing about this choice selection is that you pick out your favorite meats/cheeses/dried fruits/spreads.  Can you say Nom Nom Nom? Served up in a traditional wood board our selection of Lavender Goat Cheese, Manchego, Dried Salami, Prosciutto, Dates, Dried Apricots, Honey and Berry Jam and a basket of bread-BUT I do wish portions were a bit bigger and more bread was in the basket-BUT then I wouldn't have had room for our incredible Calamari Misto complete with battered lemon wedges and a yummy aioli dipping sauce. Everything was delicious. 

Choosing our entree for dinner was a hard choice because the surf and turf Mediterranean choices all sounded mouth-watering. Hmmm, Halibut? Sea Bass, Scallops? Butternut Squash Risotto? Salmon? Braised Short Rib Ravioli? Bouillabaisse? Decisions, Decisions! The food was all so elegantly served with so much love. I enjoyed every bite of my scallops and my hubby's ravioli.  MMMM.

Service was a bit on the super slow side but I don't like to feel rushed especially on a special occasion and your reservation here seems like its yours all night-because were here for about three hours drinking, eating, laughing, drinking, eating, laughing.  The nice thing was that I did see a few well-behaved children-so I'm always liking a place where you're not looked at cross-eyed for bringing in family.

The Sommelier helped to pick out a good wine and nice smooth Cabernet was delivered. Appropriate stemware was brought out too. Ginormous crystal wine glasses that allowed you to sniff, swirl and see the ""legs"" of the wine were much appreciated.

Dessert was not left out and we shared a fresh gourmet strawberry ""shortcake"" type of dessert which was delightful. A candle was placed on Kate's dessert so that was nice.

Overall a fun evening with friendly helpful staff. I will be telling all of my friends about this place and I do plan coming back."
test_1301,"Don't be fooled by the number of reviews this place has, it's not worth it to come here!! 

Came here in hopes of finding a good noodle spot to try.  I figured since the restaurant had the word ""noodle"" in it the noodles had to be good right?? NOPE, this was not the case at all.

We arrived and to our surprise they were able to seat us right away.  They dropped off the menus and were ready to take our order within 1-2 minutes of seating us.  I asked the waitress of any dishes that she would recommend and she said ""I'll be right back"".  She came back about 5 minutes later and I asked her the same question again.  Her facial response was blank and all she could say was ""I cannot give you any recommendations.  Just order what you think you will like""...

We ended up getting the Chicken mushroom ginger noodle soup, shrimp stir fry noodles,  and chicken wings.  Everything was OK.  The stir fry noodles tasted like the instant canton noodles that I ate as a child (an asian version of top ramen) and the wings were over cooked."
test_1302,At first I was hesitant on trying the phone number on the website. My wife came down with an illness the day of our arrival. I called and spoke to Dr. Logan who prescribed her medication. We picked it up at a local CVS. My credit card information was stolen so I only had cash. Dr. Logan trusted me enough to meet with me the following day to check up on my wife and receive payment after the fact. Thank you Dr. Logan!
test_1303,"My experience is always really good here and the girls are always real nice, but the last time I came in i dropped off about 6 shirts, 2 of which were very expensive shirts. I had asked about the starch they use and was told they would only lightly start a certain shirt as to not damage the material. When I got the shirt back it was nicely pressed, but the collar was heavily starched and looked caked on the collar really dulling the color of the shirt. It was the only time it has ever happened to me, but it was close to a $200 dollar shirt so I'm hesitant to bring expensive shirts back. Other than that the service has been great, but I cant give a 5 star rating because of that single shirt. I hope it comes clean :\ 

Patrick Richardson"
test_1304,"Overall I really enjoyed my first visit. I was quite impressed with how they were able to use the preexisting space of the building, wrapping displays around corridors and utilizing the original brick interior. It made for a very cool vibe, industrial and totally Cleveland. I also thought the exhibits were really neat. The freshwater room was an interesting idea, teaching you about local species native to the area. The touch pool is a cool feature, especially for kids, and I loved walking through the tubes of giant shark tank.

Really, I only have two criticisms. As everyone else has already discussed, the aquarium is pretty darn expensive, over $20 for an adult ticket. This is especially off-putting when combined with the fact that you have to pay to park. Also, I felt like the signage inside the aquarium wasn't nearly as informative as it should have been. Quite a few times the tanks featured far more creatures in them than what was labeled on the placards. I'm still wondering what the weird little blobby thing in the seahorse tank was!

In conclusion, a cool place to go if you've got the dough."
test_1305,"Everything under one roof, well almost everything. The grocery section is well arranged, the sweets and fast food section is my favorite; it's all 'fresh'! Prices are reasonable....well worth the experience."
test_1306,"I took my daughter to this park for the first time today. Since it was during the week, the train wasn't running but we still had lots of fun. It's a super pretty park with lots to do. You can feed the ducks, go fishing, and they have a few playgrounds for kids. My daughter loved the little splash pad that was there. I'll definitely be back on the weekend to ride the train!"
test_1307,Makaila was the best server I've ever had hands down. She was super attentive and was constantly making conversation with us. She made sure we were well accounted for and continuously made us laugh! We will definitely be coming back and asking for her as a server.
test_1308,"I love coming here because it's always a very inviting atmosphere. A bartender at the Bellagio suggested I try this place if I was looking for amazing Hawaiian food. Him being a Hawaii native, I took his word and decided to try it out. 

Russell and Gina are one of the nicest couples you will ever meet. Russell comes over and greets you with some boiled peanuts which are so addicting. We always order the combo and fried rice omelet which tastes amazing. My most recent trip my combo plate was a little too salty, but I didn't want to speak up. I'm so happy for them that they expanded into the space next door vs how small their place was when I first started going there. Best hospitality in town you feel like you're practically family!!"
test_1309,"Very good pre-school. My daughter has learned a lot on the 7 months she attended it. Kim is a great principal and runs the school very well. I just felt there was a high turnover on my daughter's classroom on the last 3 months. She had 3~4 teachers coming and leaving quickly. Also there are a couple of teachers who doesn't seem to be really into taking care of the kids, but some others who dedicate themselves very well to the job. They have an option to watch the kids over the internet which is great ! Most centers don't do this because of privacy concerns, however it means a lot for us immigrants who the families are overseas and can see their grand kids in a daily basis."
test_1310,"Newly opened, but their opening was delayed for a week because they weren't up to fire code. They fixed that quicker than you could spit, impressive! 

The inside is clean, pleasant, brightly lit. Like another Yelper said, it's brought new life to this little mall. 

The cashiers are friendly, and I'm continually surprised they don't take credit card! Maybe that will change in the future...  But for now, it docks a star. 

Great addition to Greenwin!"
test_1311,"Job done. No complaints. It was a warranty repair for my fridge. Scott came out, looked it over. Ordered some parts and in a week and a half it was fixed in an hour. It only took THAT long because it was over that long holiday stretch from Christmas to New Year's. Thank you."
test_1312,Great service!...from scheduling to details  throughout the inspection and cleaning process of my dryer vent. I highly recommend Matthew and the service he offers at Northstar Services.
test_1313,"Went here with a large group (16) for a celebratory dinner.  The staff seemed to manage us ok relative to taking orders and bringing the food out, but thereafter, they seemed absent.

Food was decent.  I got the traditional Korean BBQ short ribs, which in typical fashion, proved to be the traditionally greasy, fatty, and flavorful dish I expected.

BYOB and Karaoke help distinguish Green Pepper over other offerings in the Squirrel Hill area, but don't over stay your welcome...  at closing time the staff abruptly shut down the karaoke gig and ushered us out."
test_1314,"Being from the east coast I know a great bagel when I eat one. These guys are the real deal. I love their bagels! They have great cream cheese as well, but if you really want to set it off, get yourself a bagel sandwich. They are mighty good. I love mine with some egg, sausage, cheese, onion, and peppers. Throw some ketchup on that and mm, mm you got yourself some boom"
test_1315,"The overall service at this place is not bad. Two suggestions:
1. Make sure that you ask and confirm with them what are included in the rental package, it should be dress, veil and SHOES! The lady who helped me seems careless, she didn't tell me shoes were included in the rental even though I asked. Of course I didn't get any chance to try shoes on my first time visit, and by the end, shoes were not included in my rental no matter I need it or not.
2. Confirm that all rental items are packed in the delivery package before they send it to your hotel, otherwise if anything is missing, you will be charged by $15 deliver fee by having them bringing the missing items. It's all on you!

The homeowner and the lady helped my Fianc√© were nice and helpful. Overall it is not a bad place to do quick rental."
test_1316,"Very good food, the steaks are delicious! 11 oz vs. the 8 oz steak is recommended though. The freshly baked bread so good. we dined there numerous times and the only issue I have is that our high pitched speaking waitress was digging in her teeth in the floor length mirror and then came back to the floor without a beat, serving customers which is a concern health-wise."
test_1317,"The best Korean food in Arizona hands down! Prices are very fair, staff is very nice, we go there usually once a week. Highly recommend it."
test_1318,"I heard from a friend that a new taco place recently opened at the corner of Adelaide and Portland, so decided to go try it out for dinner. No alcohol license or tacos al pastor yet. We tried most of their tacos, all of which were exquisitely spiced and simply delicious. The ceviche (sea bass) was fresh and served with lots of chips and generous helpings of avocado. I also recommend trying the agua de Jamaica (hibiscus tea), very refreshing!

Prices were very reasonable and the service was impeccable. The seating is cozy and the large pastel coloured wall murals added to the comfortable ambiance, could a nice place for a date."
test_1319,"This is some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Everything is extremely fresh and flavorful, and the staff is great. I have had 4 different appetizers and 6 entrees, and was thrilled with them all. If you like Thai food, then you will want to give this place a try."
test_1320,"Oh, wow.  This place brought back memories of Mexico.  It's much more authentic Mexican than most places around here (and not so much Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex).  Not fancy -- pretty bare-bones hole-in-the-wall.  But very tasty!!!

My Enchiladas Mexicanas were fabulous with fresh avocado on top, for less than $10. Delicious home-made salsa on the side. Don't expect the same kind of ""Mexican"" that you get at chain restaurants."
test_1321,"I was helping my friend moving from a small apt to a bigger home and I was half dead, extremely exhausted.  Luckily, my friend referred me to this spa and I was greeted by the owner Lee and I was able to get a whole package from Judy, the masseuse.  She first provided a whole bucket of hot water to relax my feet, then she started to work on my head gently to help me relax.  At that point, my sinus and headaches felt much better due to the gentle touch.  Next, she started to work on my neck, shoulders, my feet, back and she even put some hot stones on my lower back cuz I told her I have back pain.  Her hands were amazing and I felt like she is like an angle that saved me from hell.  I had never met anyone who is as skillful or as patient as she is.  Thx again, Lee and Judy for the outstanding services and I will definitely bring my friends and coworker if they ever need."
test_1322,"Went on a Sunday afternoon, good food, very clean and nice. No complaints. Food was tasty, smoothie was good."
test_1323,"Apologies on the delay! The owner reached out to me many, many months ago and sent me a $50 gift voucher. While I personally have not been back, I did pass those vouchers along to the girl whose birthday we were celebrating that afternoon. I am not sure if she used them or not but she has been back and her experience was much a complete 180 from our initial visit in April. 
Thank you so much!"
test_1324,"Damn internet cut me off so I just lost this whole review and can't be bothered to retype it at the moment.

Haru is really good value and worth the trip. More details later."
test_1325,"I've been here for dinner for two as well as large dinner parties, and I always have a good time. I also celebrated a birthday here. They brought me out three desserts (granted I did have a large party with me). 

They have a pretty big selection of food. There's something for everyone, even the pickiest eaters. I also like how their menu changes with the seasons. I remember the calamari being really good. As well as the pizzas and the rib eye steak. YUM. And of course, I really liked their drinks. They use real fresh peach puree for their Bellini's! 

The only thing I didn't like was the openness of the restaurant. If seated near the sides, you could watch people on the slot machines while you eat. I also don't like it when people walk by and stare at you while you eat. Other than that, if you are seated in a nice area, its all good."
test_1326,"I came here for 'licious dinner last Friday and was less than impressed with the food and the service. To me, it was pretty clear that Osteria is a new restaurant and they are still trying to get their footing as there were many lags during the meal and the servers were mixed up with which table ordered what. 
Both my friend and I got the scallops to start which were soggy. The sauce was good though, very buttery. I think the server gave us someone else's order as it came out really quickly and then shortly after we finished it the same server came to give us another serving of them! 

I got the steak medium rare - it was more medium as it was very thin (you get what you pay for, right). The veggies it came with were good though... you can tell they were a bit caramelized. My friend got the penne. Her penne was nothing special and the pasta was underdone and a bit hard to chew. I really could have made better penne at home. 

Lastly, our dessert took over half an hour to get to us. We had to ask after we noticed it was nearly 20 mins and the sun had already set - it got pretty cold. We did get an apology from the server but no realty explanation as to why it was late besides ""I put it in the system but it somehow got missed"". 

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here as there are better restaurants in the area, although admittedly, the pizza did look very good (I was peeking at other tables lol). The patio was a little awkward as it was on an obvious slant so I was sitting lower than my friend and there was lots of movement of different tables around me to accommodate changing party sizes."
test_1327,Un des meilleurs choix en √©picerie fine √† Montr√©al anciennement van houtte.personnel comp√©tent et pr√™t √† vous aider.on trouve de tout...
test_1328,"Honesty was pretty disappointed. I really wanted mac n cheese for one of my sides but didn't see it on the menu,  decided I would ask just in case and I was excited to know they actually did have Mac n cheese, it just wasn't in the menu. I ordered the New York steak with mashed potatoes and corn also. Everything was great until I got my mac n cheese only to realize it was just kraft mac n cheese. I wish they would have told me that before I was told I had to pay and additional   2+$ when I could have gotten my own box for .99! Not cool Texas road house.. not cool.."
test_1329,"I would not eat here! First, smoking is allowed in the outside eating area, the wait is 2+ hours with excuses for everything, flies in most everything, silverware in open cups, worst of all... when I went to nicely state that it had been over 2 hours since we ordered with no food, we got attitude with the staff cussing at us and not comping us food. Never have I ever been somewhere this horrible! Highly not recommended!"
test_1330,"Food was so so, but service was dishonest. We ordered a lobster house special and the waiter ran off and picked the largest without telling us.  The House Special Tofu was not made with fresh ingredients.  The meat was brown, old and a bit tough. The waiter knew he did something wrong because he avoided our table and let other people place the food. 

Buyer beware.  We will not be back and would not recommend this place.

My wife and I and two small kids. $140!!"
test_1331,"Oh Rio! You are delicious. I really enjoy burritos, quesadillas, salads with tortilla strips, and yada yada. I could spend forever telling you the food is delicious.  I know this place is a little pricey, burrito + drink =9.99, but their portions are monstrous. I cannot pick up my burrito and eat it like your suppose to. Nor would I even want to sit next to someone who tries to eat the whole burrito from here without cutting it up in pieces. They give a good amount of food for the price they charge I think. Their process of taking your order too is pretty efficient. When I first came here when they opened, everyone was excited to be there and they answered all my questions about ""Whats that?"", ""Whats this?, etc.  They were patient and the staff is usually still excited to be there. During lunch time I would never go, unless your dead serious about having Cafe Rio right then and there. Only because everyone and their mom is there at noon. I usually go around 2pm and get out in 5-10min. You can sit outside and in, and a massive favorite of mine is their ice. They have Sonic style baby cubed ice and I love that! Its my favorite kind of ice! :) 

The one bad thing and it could totally be just me, but their enchiladas kind of suck to me. I have had better. But their quesadillas are my favorite so far."
test_1332,This is my second time here and I have to say it is one of the best Chinese food restaurants around town. Their Singapore rice noodles are ah-mazing!the kids loved their chicken lo-mein. happy family is a mother great dish. I will definitely come back for that and the Singapore noodles. The hubby had pad Thai with shrimps and chicken it had the perfect spice level. All dishes were tasty.  Friendly staff and they are always on top of refills.
test_1333,"STAY AWAY FROM CONNS. Not just this location but ANY of them. I have contacted the Better Business Bureau and have spoken with other customers who've realized what a ""con"" of a place this store is. There are actually over 20 complaints to the North Carolina Attorney Generals office about this particular location. If you've had a bad experience, please call Marsha at the NCAG office and file a complaint. Especially the lady who wrote a review on here that they forged her signature... eventually the NCAG will pursue a lawsuit like they did to Conns in Texas. So call call call! 

Now, I went in yesterday to look at desktop computers. Applied for their credit, because I really need a computer for school but due to a bad inquiry on my credit history from years ago, I can't get approved for Best Buy or anything like that. I was approved for $2000 at Conns, which was more than enough for a computer. I found one I liked a lot and they brought out the box, as I was waiting to get everything in order I decided to look that computer up online to see reviews. Well, low and behold there was NO info on that computer. Not on any other dealers website, not on HP, NOWHERE! It's like that computer didn't even exist anywhere else. I informed the sales associate, and several others came to see if we could find any info on this computer. Nope, nada. So I said I wasn't willing to pay $1600 for a computer that's obviously been discontinued for a long time or doesn't exist or whatever. One associate supposedly called HP and said they supposedly told him ""it was last years model and that it is being replaced with a new model"" so therefore, I was NOT paying that much for an old computer. We eventually found the ""new model"" of the computer and the brand new model was priced $400-500 less everywhere else, than this old model. I told them if they could discount that computer to at least the price of the new model, that I would still buy. They completely refused, said the only way they could discount it is if I had an actual paper flyer from a local store that showed the exact same computer for a lower price. HOW CAN I FIND THE EXACT SAME MODEL WHEN IT DOESNT SEEM TO EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE?! I told them it was a total rip off that they could price gouge something because most people, like me, come there because that's the only place they can get credit. Now I know, you expect prices to be higher at a place that can approve anyone but that price is a total scam. That's literally taking advantage of people because most people don't do their research like I did. 

I decided once I left to check some of the other computers they sell there... guess what? EVERY SINGLE MODEL they sell is discontinued or whatever the case is. You look up any of the model numbers on google and it's literally like they do not exist anywhere other than CONNartist store. 

How is that legal? I believe they're walking a fine line and i will do my best to save anyone else from buying outdated things there for way more than they're even worth. I'd rather be computer-less than to put myself in a situation with that ""business"" especially after I've read more reviews of this company. 

The associates were all extremely nice so I have no complaint there but the whole business is a scam. I'm sure everything they sell, other than computers, is an outdated model as well. Do your research and save yourself the headache... go somewhere else."
test_1334,"The wait time wasn't bad at all. The most I waited at all my appointments was maybe 15 mins. I've waited longer at airports and when it comes to my vision I don't care how long I have to wait. 

Tehani at the front is so sweet and remembers everyone. The refractive counselor Rebecca was always on top of her game and even called me after my surgery to make sure I was ok. Britney was so caring and attentive and made sure I was comfortable right before my surgery.  Dr. Wellish was so amazing and awesome and kept me calm during the entire procedure. His staff is so caring and attentive. Dr. McCandless is so nice and caring and answered any questions I had.  Bernie did my pre-op exams and was awesome as well. 

I was -6.25 in one eye and -5 in the other and now I have 20/15 vision which is better than 20/20.  It's a freaking miracle I tell you!

I definitely recommend Dr. Kent Wellish if you're considering LASIK surgery. I can't thank him and his entire staff enough!"
test_1335,"I used to joke about this place when I was in high school because a classmate worked here and this place had a funny name. I wish I hadn't because it meant I missed eating here for many years.

My wife likes to watch Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Food Network and this restaurant was featured on the program a few years ago and we liked what we saw. We tried it out, liked it and have been going ever since. There is even an autographed poster of Guy Fieri on the wall but it seems quite a few people dislike him...

There are plenty of options to choose from and what's great is that you can get samples before you order. I tried the Jerk chicken and it was possibly the spiciest thing I have ever tasted and was glad I didn't order it. Instead I found something I really do like and that's the Jade Red Chicken. I get it on plain fried rice with a Chile Relleno and it's mighty tasty. They also give you a freshly baked cookie although you don't usually give you an option of what kind. More often than not it's a snickerdoodle.

I've also picked it up to go on several occasions and I live about 20 minutes away and the food is still hot by the time I get home.

The location itself seems to have grown a bit, taking over the adjacent storefronts to expand their dining room. This place is frequently busy so this was a good move. Unfortunately it's also a hole in the wall where you sit at cheap tables and chairs and sometimes the staff doesn't always get around to cleaning the tables after someone else used them. My wife doesn't care for eating in the dining room for this very reason and she prefers to get it to go.

There used to be a location on the southeast corner of Dobson and Chandler Boulevard in Chandler but it was way in the back of a strip mall hidden behind another strip mall and few people knew about it. That location was never busy so I'm not surprised it closed.

It may seem seem strange to mix Chinese and Mexican cuisine but it works. In the case what I order, it is definitely different to eat cheese with Chinese food but I like it. This place was doing fusion before it became popular and had become an institution here in Phoenix."
test_1336,"BEWARE! I'm very skeptical of moving and transport companies in the first place, but went with this company because they promised me (on a recorded call) they they were a primary shipping service and not a broker service, like so many others have nightmares with. Complete lie. Turned out to be a broker service, refused to refund my pickup fee I paid them after I dropped my car off in person, and then took 21 DAYS to deliver my car, during which it couldn't be located for most of the time. The dropoff process in person was also a complete hoax - the representative took nearly 45 MINUTES standing in the parking lot finding scratches that did not exist on the car to mark on the condition assessment - when I asked him about it he told me that he was doing it to ""cover ourselves"" and if I ""don't like it you can have someone else do it"". I could go on - small scratches on the fender of my car, and the parking brake pedal cover was pulled off and thrown in the passenger side floorboard. 

FYI, I contacted the company via email to let them know that I am dissatisfied and will be posting this negative review unless these issues are resolved - and of course never heard back."
test_1337,"Having been to the home grown one room escape games which you pay $20 for an hr,  this one by far is well worth the money and quite well done.  If you're a fan of escape games, this is a must try.  It takes place in the actual tower in casa loma.

It's $41 pp including taxes.  Books up quickly and you're looking at a 2-3 month time frame for a spot. For the tower escape there are 12 ppl per time slot.  Ideally you'd find 11 other good friends to fill this spot,  otherwise another group may join you.  The tunnels escape there are 16. 

Do you actually need this many people?  I would say for the tower you need at least 10. There are a lot of things to do in each room, dividing and conquer is necessary and only possible to complete it in the time frame with enough people to help. 

The whole escape experience was well designed and puzzles clever, challenging and cohesive.  Puzzles were not easy but not impossible making it fun and progressive. There is a good story,  with missions to complete and is followed through until the end. 

One of the best things was that the experience was guided by actors that not only immerse you in the story but provide guidance and focus.  Ask them questions,  and they also provide hints like that help you figure out what is relevant and not.  It's quite helpful to keep things going rather than dwell on things that are not relevant.  

Although $$ it's well worth it and pretty fun.  Excellent team building.  We are already planning to go again for the tunnels escape.  

Free parking on premises after 5pm. Enter on the left side

It is 1.5 hrs with 30 mins of intro and ground rules given.  Arrive 15 mins before your allotted time (5:30, 730, 930)"
test_1338,"Second time here and it was not the best. The staff was very unfriendly. One lady we ask for help with said she does not work for T-MOBILE Arena she was with a staffing agency (we serve) and was their just to watch. We several people behind us kicking us and screaming a lot not at the show because they were wasted.  


What a shame it's a great arena but they have poor customer service"
test_1339,"Ordinarily I wouldn't go here, but since it was walking distance from my hotel and I had no desire to drive on the snowy roads, chain food became acceptable fare.  
I want to know why this place has Cajun blackened mahi-mahi on the menu when they don't cook it with an ounce of Cajun seasoning?  I got a plain grilled fish.  The cauliflower and cheese side was nearly indistinguishable from the mashed potatoes.  Only small chunks of cauliflower which probably had all the nutrients cooked out of them signaled which dish I was eating."
test_1340,Overpriced rush job! The lady cut me while doing my nails pedicure was well below average! only 1 person actually knows what they are doing and he is in high demand so rushed as well. I could've done a better job myself and will start to do the dipped nails myself!
test_1341,"I'm torn.
Food: **** 1/2
Service: *

These were the juiciest, tastiest wings I've ever had.

But the service sucked. They seemed to be over staffed and also the MoD was rare to appear (and all the wait staff snapped to attention when he did show his face).

Coupled with the loud music and obnoxious birthday procedure, the eat-in experience left much to be desired.

We might come back... But probably for takeout."
test_1342,Really enjoyed this place before... Came here today to work for a little bit as I enjoy my coffee with my business partner. Asked for wifi connection and was told we had to order two drinks before we can get internet connection! Bullshit! We will take our business elsewhere! Not recommending this place to our network of friends anymore.
test_1343,"This restaurant is all that we read it was! The fajitas were excellent with enough to take home for at least one more meal. Omar was a very, very good waiter. We never waited for anything, and he was very polite. Absolutely will return!"
test_1344,"You always hear from the West coast cult that In-n-Out is the best burger ever. I would have to humbly agree, the double double Animal style was outrageous! I really didn't know what Animal style was but heard it on TV. In-n-Out burgers makes Shake Shack seems like a poor relation. Sorry Shake Shack, In-n-Out is the clear winner"
test_1345,"I'm gonna let you all in on a little secret. I'm a malcontent. I can't help myself... it's in my DNA. Just think about how truly F-d we'd all be if every time the world tried to crap all over us, there weren't any malcontents around to crap right back! So, you can thank your lucky stars that crapping back is where malcontents like me really SHINE!   

Now, let's get into the reason I'm writing today. I recently had an interesting experience tied to a local Walgreen's Health Clinic. I was having inner ear issues (minor stuff) and didn't want to wait for an appointment with my primary care doc. And word around the block was that these clinics were convenient and fairly cost effective. As it turns out, one was right across the street from where I worked. Hip-Hip-Hooray! 

So I took a chance. Signing up at the kiosk was simple and quick. Once I got in, the fellow who took my payment info was polite and efficient. The wait time to see the Nurse Practitioner was reasonable, and before long, I was given a course of treatment and sent on my way. 

Okay, so what's so bad about all that, you ask? Turns out that my credit card was kept on file with Walgreen's after I paid the initial deductible. I didn't know about this until a week later when Walgreen's tapped my account for an additional fee my insurance carrier wouldn't cover. 

Okay, so what's so bad about all that, you ask? Nothing, until I tried to call customer service to ask them to remove my credit card info from their system. This is where things started to get real dicey...

I called the clinic directly. ""Can't help you here,"" the lady said, so I was given a number for the billing department... which turned out to be in the Philippines. So I ask the rep in the Philippines to transfer me to a rep in the US, and they send me to Orlando. The Orlando rep says, ""You need the billing department,"" and she sends me back to the Philippines.
 
So, again, I ask for a US rep. They send me back to Orlando. Orlando says, ""You need the billing department."" I say, ""The Philippines told me YOU were the US billing department."" Then, right in the middle of the conversation, Orlando hangs up on me. 

Now my blood is really pumping and I'm thinking I'm gonna need a second visit to the Walgreen's Clinic for a fix for high blood pressure; they already have my credit card on file, right? 

So I call the clinic again. The office rep answers and says, ""I have no way to remove your credit card info so you'll have to go back to the billing department."" So I beg like a starving circus animal to have her to send me to the billing department in the USA. 

She says, ""I can't guarantee that,"" and gives me another 800 number to try. So I call that number and guess where I end up? You got it! The Philippines!

So I ask the fella on the phone, ""How's the weather over there in the Philippines?"" And he politely says, ""Very nice, with not a drop of rain in the sky."" And I say, ""I'm very glad the weather over there is so very nice with not a drop of rain in the sky."" I then thank him for his fine weather report, hang up and give up. 

What a shame that all those front end wins by the folks at the clinic were lost on the back end due to poor customer service around Walgreen's billing process. 

On the bright side, if I ever want to know what the weather's gonna be like in the Philippines on any given day, all I gotta do is call the Walgreen's billing department."
test_1346,"Middle of the road steak house, not bad but not good either.  Some many better options in the downtown core.  Last time I was there I asked for a NY rare and as the waiting walked away I got scared they would over cook it so I asked for BLUE rare, the waiter didn't know what that meant so I assured him the ""chef"" wold know.  I got a well done steak that o sent back and got another well done steak.  Long story short I grabbed a cheese burger on the way home.  Some hits, lots of misses."
test_1347,"Greg is absolutely wonderful!!!  He is super easy to communicate with, and a very talented all around Handyman.  I used him for a ceiling fan project, and then actually used him for an entire kitchen remodel!  He is great at drywall/paint/texture/electrical; capable of the small to large project.  He rolled with all the punches that can come with a big project, and at every turn helped me feel at ease with the whole process.  He has great attention to detail and offers wonderful suggestions and tips that the average homeowner wouldn't think of.  

I really can't say enough about how happy I am with his work, his work ethic, and his personality.

Can't wait to work with you again Greg!

(will update my review with photos of his amazing work once the tile floors are finished)"
test_1348,"This place has a pretty nice vibe. It's kind of an upscale fast food taco shop. The ordering process was odd. This line for this and this line for that. Definitely not fast food taco prices. We had 2 bowls and 2 fountain drinks and it came to just under $30

I had a chicken bowl. The chicken was good but overall the food lacked flavor. You definitely have to add some from the salsa bar which had tons of options to choose from. 

It was very clean and the staff was friendly. They have a ton of seating downstairs and upstairs. I went early in the day during the week so it wasn't very busy. 

I noticed you could order adult beverages at their bar which would be awesome if I was going for dinner."
test_1349,Food as always is good.  The Service on the other hand is very unaccomdating.  The girl at the register let us know when we asked if there was a manager available that they were all on vacation.  So I am guessing that customer service is the last thing this place realy cares about.  Because of the rudness.
test_1350,"The food was incredible. For the most part the meals are small portions, but great for sharing amongst many people (you can also tell they are not the healthiest meals - so small portions is a benefit). 

The cocktails were wonderful. The restaurants atmosphere itself is hugely busy and dark - but if this does not bother you, it will not ruin the experience. On the pricier end, but worth it!"
test_1351,"My first ever in-n-out burger here was amazing! The line was backed up around the store but it moved very fast. As I approached the cashier to put in my order, he made great suggestions as what to order (love the staff here, very friendly and helpful). I ordered the animal style fries, double cheese burger, and a chocolate milk shake. Their portions are huge and I got all that for less than $10! What a deal! I love in-n-out and I can't wait to go back to the mainland to get me some more!! :)"
test_1352,"Super good broth, excellent flavor. Prices and sizes of Pho have changed from yelp pics of the menu, but still totes worth it. Trying the sammies next time. 10/10 will return!"
test_1353,"Came here as a first timer to get a pedicure. First impression was that it was a beautiful salon and looked clean!
 The lady who did my pedicure was a bit rude and rushed through it. She was very rough handling my legs, she would ask me to lift my legs and then rudely pushed the down with force and seemed annoyed. She rushed through the best part of every pedicure, the massage. She tapped my legs once and called it a day. Everyone seemed to be pre-occupied and not interested in quality customer care. The salon was not busy when I went, not cool.

Wasn't impressed, I probably will not be coming back."
test_1354,"I hate coming to this urgent care but Because of my insurance and the proximity to my house its my default urgent care.  

There is no sense of urgency what's so ever here.  Some of the medical assistants look like they jut rolled out of bed without showering or laundering their scrubs. The front desk can be very slow.  Some of the dr's hate being there.  

If you have a choice go elsewhere."
test_1355,"Loved the sides. But that was about it. We went on a Saturday so they were a bit busy, so I will give them thtat, but they dont seem to igve you a waiter so it seems like they all help serve you. We ordered and then waited and waited. Still ok But we all ordered our burgers medium rare and they were all well done. Now one thing I do ask for in a burger only place is if you are only doing burgers, then at least get the temp right. The tea was good and so were the sides but the burger was about the same as I can do at home.  Its seemed a bit dry and crumbled, most likely because it was well done. I did like the way they made the lettuce as a bun when I asked for no bread due to allergies.  The decors is super nice"
test_1356,If you want to feel a LOT of pain use their hair removal service.  When I visited this place it was my first time using laser and I was naive enough to believe that laser hair removal was a painful thing.  Shop around and you will see that there are other providers with much better equipment that is NOT painful at all. Do not use this provider. Avoid at all costs!
test_1357,"Regardless of the rental car company, you need to take a shuttle to and from the Rent-a-car Center. We waited about 30 minute in 105+ degree heat on a hot Vegas Day waiting for a shuttle in line to just get on the shuttle. The drive is only about 10 minutes and once you get to the center it is easy to find your rental car company and to get on and off the garage. Just account for extra wait times to get to and from the airport if you travel in the summer or peak season time."
test_1358,"My family LOVES Tott's!  Its clean, fresh and honest food.  Never disappoints."
test_1359,"Ron's is definitely a dive 100% no frills. They have a 2.99 breakfast special eggs, meat, hash browns, buciut which is a great price. I got the western omelet it was good the grits were a little too watery for me. I haven't had anything else other than breakfast so I can't review them, but I hear The burgers are amazing. And all their prices are great!"
test_1360,"This outfit makes the post office look competent, and that's saying a lot. I do a lot of ordering from Drugstore.com; make that ""I used to"" do a lot of ordering from there. I haven't really had a problem up to now, but boy howdy, now I totally get OnTrac's horrendous reputation.

My original order was shipped 11/25/15, with a projected arrival date of 11/27/15. OnTrac's crackerjack tracking page showed as ""out for delivery"" until 11pm, then ""miraculously"" it showed as having been delivered at 4:17pm that afternoon. What the what? Oh, and like so many others here, I'd been trying to call their CS number since 7pm. At one point I was on hold for almost an hour before I gave up. I tried again at 11pm and again, ""all agents are busy"". Well, no doubt that actually was true, due to their shitty service and falsification of records.

Shot off an email to Drugstore.com, who I'm sure has heard these complaints ad infinitum, they yawned and rubberstamped the order for a repeat (duplicate) delivery. 

The second replacement order was due (in OnTrac's fantasy land time) to arrive 12/3/15. When that came and went and the package still showed as being ""out for delivery"" I entertained myself with wondering what lie they would make up this time. Badda-bing, I get up the next morning  (12/4) to see that they claimed to deliver it on 12/3 at 6:17pm. Hoo-ha. Sent another email to Drugstore.com, they shrugged it off and said they would send the order a THIRD time. I immediately emailed back and said DO NOT SEND IT VIA ONTRAC. Result: they sent it via OnTrac.

Almost forget the funniest part, after the fictitious 12/3/15 non-delivery on the tracking page, right below that they show, 12/5/15 ""out for delivery"". But, but, how can you deliver a package that was already delivered? Their incompetence is breathtaking.

Sooo, now I'm waiting on what will be my *third* non-delivery and taking guesses how many times Drugstore.com will send out the same order again and again and again and again, etc etc. It's pretty much a game at this point. It's their choice to use this POS delivery company, so they can ship out a thousand packages, I don't care, they will never get to me.

Oh, and Drugstore.com? I've been ordering from you for like, 15 years.  You're dead to me now. But please keep sending out the same order over and over, it does gives me a tiny bit of satisfaction that you are doomed to repeat this futile endeavor endlessly."
test_1361,"We had a great experience at the Cornelius, NC Enterprise location.  Brendon was quick to wait on us and when he mentioned an upgrade we were a little skeptical but after seeing the car, a 2015 Challenger, we quickly decided it would be worth it.  Thanks Brendon and Enterprise for a great experience."
test_1362,"Super nice, great job, and a short wait! So excited to have a threading place in the west valley. Will definitely be back!"
test_1363,"This Indigo location is one of my favourites.  They have the best selection of business books.  Their hold/special services department is very helpful too.

This store does get quite busy, so if you are looking for a quiet corner to read in, go to indep book store Nicholas Hoare (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/nicholas-hoare-toronto) or off the main drag awesome coffee spot Merchants of Green Coffee (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/merchants-of-green-coffee-toronto).

This Indigo seems to be the flagship shop.  If a celeb is going to be in town and sign their books - this is the spot.  Strange they choose here actually as the lay out is quite tight and not much extra space is available."
test_1364,"Very cozy restaurant with outside seating. On weekend nights, ton of energy. Awesome food. Pizza is thin and very generous with the quality toppings. Price is not too bad for the pizza size and taste you get."
test_1365,"As a local, and fan of Guy, I've been here many times. The burger recipes are great. My problem is I'm seeing the quality diminish each time I go back. Burgers are sloppy looking or burnt, and at $20 a burger, you expect better quality. Service is still sub par but I expect this on the Strip now sadly. Also, Guy always offered a discount to locals in his restaurants and now this is gone. If the management can improve quality, I'll go back. Until then, there are plenty of other places to choose from for the price point."
test_1366,"The house Trofie Pesto Genovese (pasta spirals with green beans, potatoes and a light fresh basil) is prepared to perfection with light Crissy green beans and cubed potatoes. The homemade pasta is delightfully tasty and the dish could be eaten hot or cold  No need to add anything, perfect the way it's prepared."
test_1367,First time here my experience was perfect at the bar.  Now i my friend has been trying to get service. And no one hears him.   They just walk past. I find it to be a bit on the rude side.
test_1368,"just from a ""tourist""'s point of view...this is one of the hotels i love visiting in vegas.  their decor is amazing...from the realistic sky to the backdrop of italian boutiques.  it was photo galore!!

i definitely took many pics here.

next time, i'll stay here and maybe try the gondola ride--it looks ultra romantico!!"
test_1369,"I stopped in one Friday night, not even realizing that the old Pub had closed and that this was an entirely new pub. But I decided to stay and I'm glad I did. It was about 10pm and the place was packed. There was a DJ playing, people dancing and the crowd was having a lot of fun. It was a great atmosphere. It was too late for dinner but I looked at a menu and everything looks delicious. I'm definitely going to go back for dinner. Overall, Rudy's seems like a great addition to Lee Rd and I'm glad they're there!"
test_1370,"I can't fathom why Pizzeria Bianco does not have a better average rating. We dined on a Saturday night and had a pleasant experience as always. We started out with the antipasti. The cheeses on the board were okay - I've definitely had better. However, everything else was delicious. The broccoli, butternut squash and brussel sprouts were seasoned well. The prosciutto was good. I had the gnocchi and it was AMAZING. It was cooked perfectly. The pork with the gnocchi was tender and tasty. My boyfriend had one of the main dishes that consisted of beef and kidney beans. He unfortunately did not like it at all. It was bland and the presentation was terrible. Our server was great and so was the ambiance. I definitely feel like Pizzeria Bianco is a place you would go to for amazing pizza and pasta. Everything else on the menu is mediocre."
test_1371,"We went here for my birthday last night (and my twin brother's birthday). I had done a lot of research and thought this was our best bet for a Mexican place on the strip.... maybe... but there has got to be something better. 

We started off with free chips and salsa (decent, green one was my favorite). Then, our server  asks if we'd like guacamole for the table ($10). We agreed thinking that it would be a big bowl of guacamole. Boy were we wrong. The guac arrived on a small plate and wasn't even enough to eat with chips and our meals. 

As for drinks, don't get the pitcher of margaritas. You're better off drinking before or after you come here because WHAT A RIP OFF!!!! We got a pitcher ($50) and it was very small and filled more than half way with ice!!! There was only enough for one round of margaritas for the four of us, plus 2 more glasses we had to split... sorry but in a $50 pitcher we should be able to refill our glasses once with no problems. 

Then came the food... I ordered the market vegetable quesadillas because I'm vegetarian and that was pretty much the only option besides the mushroom dish. I also asked for a side of black beans and rice, but I was told there was only black bean puree... um.. how do you get the puree if you don't have the beans? The quesadillas were gross and super soggy. The cheese was this thick white stuff (cojita? I think). Anyways, gross. I make better quesadillas myself. The rice tasted stale and the beans were weird  since I wanted real beans and not mush. 
They did bring us free birthday desserts, which was nice. Overall, this place is HORRIBLE."
test_1372,"Decided to come here after passing it on my way to 5Church. Glad I decided to stop by instead.

Ordered:
-Dando Crab Cakes: 4/5. Typical crab cakes, cooked well, flavorful sauce. 2x cakes served on a bed of leafy greens. 
-Grilled Lamb Lollipops: 3.5/5. The lamb lollipops themselves were great, but I was not a huge fan of the sweet, black cherry based jus they were served on.
-Surf and Turf: 5/5. Fantastic and definitely my favorite dish of the night. Tender scallops and perfectly cooked pork belly on an absolutely flavorful bed of sauce and pesto. 
-Sweet and Spicy Green Beans: 3.5/5. Fairly typical green beans served with a sweet, and very mildly spicy sauce. 

I would definitely come back in the future. Great selection of beer too."
test_1373,"Bottom Line: Don't waste your time, horrible/poor service... 

Lets just say we showed up at 6:20 pm and told they were running behind and we would have to wait a bit for food, which ok, we drove all this way we can wait no biggy. We set up our ""own table"", sat and waited. Twenty minutes passed, we watched the waitress serve two other tables, refill drinks and polish silver ware.  The whole time we sat parched with no service and treated as unwanted guests.  After seeing the waitress giggle with her co-worker numerous times as we sat unattended, we finally had enough of the poor service and walked out the door. I am sure they didn't care and were rather happy that we left because it was one less paying customer to deal with. 
That will be the first and last time we ever try Jake's especially with my out of town family members, thanks for the great story that we can tell over and over again."
test_1374,"Finally came here after much oohing and aahing one day. The outside can be very deceiving- it's a lot bigger on the inside! I was actually quite surprised.

The service was good, our waitress was friendly and was quick when we needed things. However, she wasn't the greatest with suggestions. I asked her thoughts between two dishes and instead she just told me she'll give me a few minutes and walked off.

We ordered the garlic bread to start and that was not good at all. It was burnt and just not a good garlic bread in my opinion. The pasta came shortly after and it was alright. I ordered the chicken florentine pasta and it was meh. It was bland most of the time and the other times the Alfredo sauce was just to much for my taste. However, my husband's special of the day was not bad but still more on the bland side. 

It was a good experience and nice place but my hunt for a mind blowing Italian food place is still a go!"
test_1375,"This has become my favorite thai restaurant in Cleveland. Been here a couple times now and truly enjoyed each time.
starting with apps, special mention of the steamed shumai (delish!) and chicken satay.
There are several entrees that are worth acknowledgment, but hands down, my favorite is mango curry and the thai style basil - just amazing.
I'm not a fan of the desert here, but everything else is awesome.
Service is quick, prices are very fair. Restaurant is bustling and very clean."

My first time I had a honeydew snow and it was so good.  I ordered the supersized one, but that's really more like a small at some places or the size of a regular drink at McDonald's.  That's under $4.

You can add boba, or other jelly concoctions to your drink at an additional charge, which I don't know what that is, but it's under $0.50, so less than it would be at a yogurt shop.

My son got a lychee milk tea and it was a cold drink with the boba being hot.  Which, for him recovering from Thrush, was the perfect combination.  My daughter is addicted to horchata and was able to get a Horchata drink with a Coffee Jelly and she loved that.  This time I got a Coconut Papaya Snow Boba and it was fabulous.

My mechanic got a Papaya Milk Tea Boba and his helper got a Coconut Yogurt Boba.  They liked those, too.  

Anyway, it's a bit far from where I live, but only a mile from my kids' school, so maybe as an afternoon treat sometimes, we can come here and try more flavors.  They have good service and are quick."
test_1378,"Yogurt is fine but the staff are not consistent with purchase of products.  3 months of going there & staff know they offer a 25% discount when you purchase the extra large cup. However, other evening went in got my extra large cup, filled it up & the owners son told me they have never offered 25% off!! He was very rude.  I was not there to argue - so I just walked out. So frustrating cause the little store is so close to home. Just wish they'd get there act together:("
test_1379,"Found out today the credit union is sending new credit cards to replace the visa cards we now have.  No reason for the change other than we get ""perks"" with the new cards.  Perks like Auto rental collision damage waiver, cellular telephone protection, etc.    The cards have new numbers so we have to update bill or recurring charges tied to the old card number.  Keep the perks or tie them to the card we have now.  I called the main office today to ask about the cards, and after answering 20 questions from them, I was able to ask are we getting new cards and why?  Seems like a move made by the credit union with no thought about the inconvenience to the customer."

test_1381,Cody did an awesome job on my car! Way better than going to a carwash. He obviously cares about his work. The best part is he came to my house.

Definitely recommend and will use Cody again!

I got a foot detox and a massage.

But about the Stadium itself. It's located in the heart of North side Pittsburgh with views of the skyscrapers.

test_1387,"Our pet Schnauzer ""Bear"" was diagnosed Lymphoma on 8/8/2016 by Dr. Hudman at Kennel Care in Chandler. He 
was prescribed Prednisone and I was told he had 30 to 60 days to live.  Hudman also recommended chemo therapy, which I declined. On 8/28 our pet started experiencing, what we thought was pain. On two evenings, my wife even slept with him on the floor to help comfort him. When I initially talked to Dr. Hudman he indicated dogs didn't experience pain with Lymphoma, if anything it would be like humans have the flu bug. On 8/29 I called his office 1st thing in the morning and left a message for Hudman to call me. At 4pm and not hearing back, I called again only to talk to a girl that got a little testy me saying he returns his calls after 5pm. I never heard back so 2 days later on 8/31 I called again and because of the tone in my voice, I was immediately transferred to the office manager Nick. By the time the call ended Nick understood how upset I was about not receiving a call back but more so how concerned I was about Bear. After another 2 days I never heard from their office at which point a friend of mine referred me to another animal hospital. I contacted them, set up an appointment and requested that they have the medical records on both of my dogs transferred from Hudman's office. Lord and behold within 20 minutes of the request, I then received a call from Dr. Hudman. How convenient. 
Even though his apology sounded sincere, his justifications didn't make sense.  I no longer trusted him or his staff to entrust the lives and welfare of my pets. There was no excuse for their lack of professionalism and sincere concerns for my pet's welfare. Perhaps they are disorganized, perhaps they were upset they weren't earning thousands of dollars for chemo therapy or perhaps they really lack a sincere interest in the welfare of my pets. Whatever the excuse or rationality, they will never attend to any of my pets and I will never recommend their medical services to any pet owner.
My appointment was today at the Alma School Animal Hospital and I visited with Dr. Christian. After examining my dog and asking me a lot of questions she prescribe a slight pain killer for Bear which will help him feel more comfortable for what remaining days he has left. Hudman never prescribed any pain killers! When it's time we will bring him in and have him euthanized by them. 
In conclusion, Hudman and Kennel Care for whatever rational, cause undue stress to both me and my wife and God knows how much pain Bear had to live through for a few days by not returning my calls and attending to his needs. After what we just experienced with them, I know they didn't have any sincere interest for Bear's welfare. I wouldn't recommend Dr. Hudman or Kennel Care to anyone for any reason.

test_1396,"I went to this establishment on 01/15/13 to fulfill my Wellness Benefit for my Health Benefits.  This visit was extremely quick as they weighed, measured, and checked my blood pressure.  They also influenced me to get the Flu shot, as they explained people had died from the flu at that point in the year. 

I paid my co-pay and left, planning to return in the future for a full physical.  A few days after this visit I found out that my HR department had made a mistake during my enrollment, and they made the mistake of showing no coverage for my domestic partner (my girlfriend) and I.  I was forced to place a dispute with my HR, which was a 30-45 day process.  

On 02/11/13 I received a phone call from Amber Perez from Warner Family Practice stating that I owed a balance of $227.00. I explained the situation I was in, as my HR had been taking the payment out for the Health Coverage all along and currently, as well as having AETNA cards.  I explained that I was in the middle of an appeal with my HR and that within a couple weeks it should all be fixed.  I also explained that I would willingly pay if for some reason they didn't fix the coverage, but I did not want to pay until this was over as it would be a nightmare to be reimbursed.  She coldly stated that they would not do that and they can arrange payment arrangements, and she will be mailing me a bill. 

I called after work days after receiving the bill hoping to speak to someone else to explain the situation.  There was never an answer and I left a voicemail asking for a call back, which I never received.  Below I have shown emails from Ms. Perez.  I sadly purchased a home just behind this office and planned to have them as my family's doctor.  But after this HORRIBLE treatment I would NEVER recommend anyone to go this money-hungry office.

Hello,

I called on Tuesday at 430pm and left a voicemail with my telephone number. I also explained that I am in an appeal with my HR department, as I paid for coverage this year. I would appreciate it if I could wait until the end of the month, as my appeal was filed on 1/28/13, and can take 45 days. I have no problem paying if I need to; however, my insurance should be paying this. 

Regards,
Colin 

---

I did speak with you on 2/11/13 and explained that we are not able to hold claims you are appealing. If the insurance contacts the office with payment information then we can put as their responsibility, but at this time they do state you are not covered. We can set you up on 40.00 monthly payments or payment in full and of course will reimburse you if they make payment.

Thank you for your prompt response. I will be checking with my HR department to see if there has been any resolution to my appeal. Paying in full is not an issue, but I know getting that back from my insurance company will be difficult. Regardless of this issue, I am baffled at your customer service, I will be sure to tell everyone I know how your company solely cares about a payment and your lack of concern for patients. 

-----

I just called my HR and was told my insurance has been corrected. The policy number remains the same as I provided. I then called AETNA and was told there is a 7-10 day time frame until this is fully fixed. 

Thank You,
--------

I can take out of your responsibility and I will verify with Aetna they are processing you claim for you in that time frame, thank you.

test_1397,"Coal Burger offers a healthier spin on your normal fast food burger place, which is refreshing. You can satisfy your craving and not feel too guilty about it after. Also, they  are very eco-friendly, from the straws they use, to the materials their tables are made of, even the bathrooms stress green-ness. 

I normally get the 1/3 coal burger on a gluten free bun with mixed fries. This amount of food always leaves me full, but not with the heavy feeling of a greasy meal. Which is something that I love about them - no nasty grease! The fries are cooked in rice oil, the beef is coal fired, AND they have gluten free buns?? It is really nice to have options when it comes to this kind of cuisine. 

The service is great, everyone is friendly. My order is always comes out perfect, just like I ordered it. 

I give the 4 star rating because I haven't tried a lot of other items on their menu."

They took care of handling the times with the church and the cemetery and they made sure that everything came together.  On the day of the funeral, everything went smoothly. We had no problems or disappointments.  They allowed us to have the procession go by my parents home and that was an added special touch to our grief.  They took care of
the website, DVD's, flyers, brochures, thank you cards...everything we needed was included.  We also had our Friday service there and the banquet food was delciious! 
Thank you Palm Cheyenne Mortuary and Phil W. for making our day stress free!"
test_1401,"I would just like to post this public service announcement for tourists:

Las Vegas is not Thunderdome.

Yes, there are laws here. They're pretty much the same as the laws in the city you just came from, except for maybe the gambling thing. 

Yes, you ARE expected to pay attention to traffic lights, signs and pedestrian right-of-way. On the other side of the coin, if you feel the need to fight over who is the true bottom bitch of D-Money's stable, please don't do it in the middle of a crosswalk. 

You can't Smokin' With Cigawettes on RTC buses, in elevators, or in the middle of Vons. Also, you have to actually pay bus fare or show a pass, you can't just drunkenly stumble on the bus and sit down while yelling ""YESH I HA MY PASS IS IN MY POCKET FUCK OFF"" at the driver. 

This also extends to social norms, which did not stop being a thing when you pulled off of I-15 or landed at McCarran. The entire city is not a giant theme park. Random other people you see are not animatronics or part of your tour package. If you talk loud stupid shit to them or put hands on them, be fully prepared for your dumb ass to be (deservedly) KO'd. Nobody outside casino/hotel employees is being paid to put up with you or an ounce of your shit. 

Let's also get some expectations in line. Casinos only care about people who spend shit tons of money at that particular casino. They don't care enough about the once-a-year tourist in the $60 a night room to let them get away with their reenactment of The Hangover. And no, Jon Favreau was mistaken in Swingers - ""you dress like you have your shit together and they comp you free shit"" is not even remotely how casino comp policies work. They don't care about how much money they think they might get from you, they care about how much you're already blown with them. 

I know there are a bunch of you who are basically sociopaths who have to repress it constantly in order to do things like not get fired from your job or be ostracized from the rest of the world. And I know Vegas tourism advertising sends you powerful ""dog whistles"" indicating the whole purpose of the city is to indulge your desire to run around and be a raging asshole with no consequences, just let your inner sociopath fly with no one ever telling you ""no"". However, try to keep in mind that the casinos that advertise this to you do not run the city of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Winchester, Paradise, etc. They only run their own casino. And the amount of shit they will actually let you get away with within those casino walls is entirely determined by how  many 0s are in your average daily value to them. Want to do your own personal Hangover? There better be five of those zeros, bare minimum. Six is where you can start to feel safe. Vegas casinos only cater to really rich sociopaths, not the broke ones.  

This has been a public service announcement."
test_1402,"I always had an inkling this place would be cute, bit it far exceeded my expectations. The inside is a blissful, Instagram-worthy pile of wickedly good cuteness. Bright colors, an indoor swing, huge picture frames and even a ""puppy protector"" await. What's a puppy protector? Well, you can't bring your dog inside, but you can take the key to the pink ""puppy protector"" house and your pup can wait safely outside while you grab your ice cream inside. They have seating outside, so not to worry, you can come back and eat with your pup. I didn't stay to enjoy my ice cream because too many kids were running around outside, but you definitely could.

The staff inside were super helpful for being teenagers at a likely summer job (god bless). Side note: holy moly, 1 scoop is HUGE! It was more than enough for me. I'm basically a Key Lime Pie ice cream aficionado. I try it at every ice cream place I visit (hey, we all have our favorite flavors, don't hate, okay), and Tremont Scoops is definitely up there in my favorites. It had a wonderful, lime flavor that wasn't overwhelmingly sugary. They also have vegan flavors (if that's important to you) and a pretty transparent menu (if again, that's important to you. Some of us just love ice cream and accept it for what it is, a calorie fiesta of unhealthiness). Love this spot for a new ice cream stop with friends or a date. Its casual enough without being stuffy and cute enough that it could be cozily romantic."

After 45 minutes I asked what happened and they immediately seated me at the outside bar. I ordered the cheesebuger and asket for it medium. They said they only cook them medium or medium well So I said definelty more on the medium side. This came with there assorted fries. The $19.00 burger arrived 30 minutes, after my first biter I realize it is overcooked to beyond well and cold! Dryed out and tasteless! The fries were also luke warm. I was very hungry from traveling all day and forced myself to eat half of this disgusting thing. My waitress was nice, however never asked how everything was? When she did come to clean up I told her how unhappy I was withe meal. Ans asked for the ck and said I was ready to leave. Five minutes later a so clled manger approaches me and says""You wanted me"" I said excuse me and let him know how unhappy I was with the food. he had a bad attitude, but did ask if I wanted a new one and said no. Had enough of this 2 hour fiasco. I eat out very frequently and must say :this was on of the worst burgers I have ever eaten at any cost. Stay away, for $19.00 get some real edible food. NOT HERE!"
test_1408,"This place is a hidden gem for getting delicious bread for cheap! All loafs of bread are only $2 after 6pm. My favourite is their cape seed bread made with whole wheat flour and packed with many grains and seeds. Its's so good! They also have a variety of other breads, rolls and baguettes that look just as good. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I am not a real big fan of their desserts. They have a wide variety of cakes and pies, but the once I tried so far did not really stand out. However, I will certainly be coming back for more of their delicious bread."
test_1409,This Target is great.  Super organized & clean.  The employees have worked there forever & that usually says something about management.
test_1410,Ordered House Friend Rice ..You can't go wrong with that right ? Almost $ 9 for a regular size box . When I opened it the box was packed full of rice and I kept searching for the chicken and pork and shrimp and no eggs . Well I counted 4 medium sized shrimp and the chicken and pork was very little and was in tiny micro pieces ?  So I called them back and asked to be accommodated with a credit to get something else . She told me next time to ask for extra meat? Didn't say she wouldn't charge me for it just ask for it ...WoW !  I am not a racist by any means but I hate literally eating from small mom and pop operations like this there is no customer service respect or guarantee.  Stick with the big chains at least if your food is bad or you are not satisfied they will accommodate you. They obviously know what they are doing and don't care . But charge the regular price like most Asian places .  I would seriously avoid this place they are here to nickle and dime you and very stingy with the servings of meat. Don't call something house fried rice if its just rice ...Good luck with your business .
test_1411,"This place is Awesome! Great Burgers, Great fries, and they serve Alcohol, I was not drinking this time! Only reason not 5 stars is because I spent $12.00, but its worth it!!!"

They have Fish, chicken, and beef awesome salads and awesome customer service!"
test_1416,"I have never had such awful service!
We ordered 2 pizzas online and showed up to pick them up right when the website told us our pizzas would be ready. When we walked in we were asked what our order was and then paid for it. We then sat down waiting for our food. About 20 minutes went by in which 4 more customers walked in, paid and left with their orders. Finally, we were asked what we had order. After informing the kid once again what we bought, he walked over to the heated pizza holder and pulled out our order. Then, with no words spoken, he set the order on the table we were waiting at and walked away. 
I didn't even know what to say to the worker so we just went home only to eat a soggy pizza with a chewy crust (assuming from sitting in the warmer for a half hour)."
test_1417,"I really love smiths so it breaks my heart that I have to give this store such a bad review but here is what happened. I went shopping to pick up a few things and there was something spilled on the floor, instead of cleaning it up one of the employees put a wet floor sign on top of it, well in the middle of the spill but it was a big spill. Obviously I didn't see the sign until after I fell, mind you I'm 40 weeks pregnant and this could of ended disastrously. I escaped from the incident with some painful bruises but when I approached an employee to tell them about the incident never once did they apologize they just asked me where the spill was. I will never shop at this store again! Bad enough that I fell while pregnant but what if it had been an elderly person? this is unacceptable!"
test_1418,The Chicken Chettinad was sublime. I ordered it 8/10 hotness and it did not disappoint. Most of the other Indian style restaurants I've ate ate have been mostly northern so a lot of the dishes on the menu I had not had before. The Chettinad is my new favorite! Paired with a Southern Teir 2xIPA and I was in heaven on earth. Can not wait to take some friends here!!
test_1419,Great tasting cannoli! A little pricy for the size though. Good as a one off desert when out with family/friends.
test_1420,Food was sosi but a lot of it. Had truffle fries to start. My partner eeally enjoyed because truffle. Im not into shoe string fries. I got the 14hr brisket. Needed to cook more. Wouldnt cut with a fork. Got a side of mac n cheese. Gross. Just noodles with velveta cheese poured over. No flavor at all. Partner had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Its a chicken Philly. We both would have exspected a lot more from Guy. All the dishes just lacked a lot.
test_1421,"This is the holy grail of restaurants for parents... a place that is kid-friendly AND has good food. I didn't think it was possible. Based on all the family-friendly spots we've been to, this one has the best food. Now, I don't think it's on par with elite restaurants on the Strip, but it's still very tasty.

What really makes this place special is the value -- a happy hour (from 4:30 - 6:30) where appetizers, wine, and cocktails are $5 and Kona pale ale is $3. They also have a three course prix-fixe menu for $35.

The mixed green salad ($7.95 and not on the HH menu) was respectable, although not the sexiest dish. Both the tempura crusted spicy ahi roll and crunchy lobster potstickers were delicious fusion options worth getting again. The wagyu sliders (2 per order) were tender and juicy and sat on a pretzel-like bun. They were accompanied by garlic sweet potato fries. The biggest letdown was the salt and pepper crisped calamari. While the sweet and spicy flavor was enjoyable and the addition of macadamia nuts was a nice contrast in texture, it was a heavy dish that could have benefited from having the sauce on the side.

The kid menu isn't cheap -- at $13 -- but it does come with three courses. The appetizer is a cheese quesadilla with sliced apples, celery and carrots. There are six kid entrees to choose from. The final course is either a sundae or fresh fruit (guess which one my kid chose).

Another pleasant surprise was the quality of service. From the host and hostess to our waiter and food runners... everyone was warm and welcoming. It's almost commonplace to walk into a ""nice"" restaurant with a child and suffer poor service from employees who don't want you there. So, getting the kind of attention and friendliness that we received was shocking. That level of care will turn us into repeat customers, as there's no doubt we'll be back, whether or not it's for a family night out or a date night."
test_1422,"Topgolf is one of the best ideas I have ever heard . It's a driving range/bar .

The driving range is not your typical driving range . It's three stories high with each group having your own lane and clubs. Wish they had a better selection of clubs though. Their is a couple of games you can play with the group from competitive to just having a great time . All levels of play can go and succeed at the games . 

The bar is really packed on the weekends and tough to get a drink but once you get on your lane which can sometimes be a hours long wait you have you own personal bar tender which is awesome . 

I definitely recommend going to top golf. The only reason I give it  4 stars is because of the slow bar service and the amount of choices for clubs is slim"
test_1423,"The Cabin Club offers outstanding steaks paired with an excellent wine selection.  If you are looking for a truly marvelous dining experience I would recommend sitting at the bar, the service from the bartenders (Katie and Tracy) is really exquisite,  They were very attentive and anticipated my needs without me even having to ask for a refill.  I would also suggest you try their outstanding ribs or the cowboy steak (a wonderful bone in rib eye not on the menu)."
test_1424,"The people here are knowledgeable, personal, and extremely helpful. I received my glasses promptly, and I got all the bells and whistles (transitions, scratch and glare resistant, lightweight, progressive...) for a fraction of what I would have paid elsewhere. Alex helped with my prescription, and when I returned for an adjustment, Renee was wonderful. She really knows her stuff, and she is always cheerful.  When I had questions about policy on changing eye prescription, she explained it and advised me of the timeframe to get the next pair at a reduced cost.  She told me to come back after I visited my ophthalmologist and to not hesitate to let them know what they could do to help.  It's refreshing to find such outstanding customer service as well as good products for such a reasonable price!

test_1426,"Allow me to begin by saying I love Mexican food.  Love. It.  That said, my opinion is based on lots of visits to Mexican restaurants.

The service was great.  I was seated quickly, my water and chips/salsa arrived almost immediately, and my food arrived less than 5 minutes after I ordered it.  The salsa was so spicy I couldn't eat it, but the chips were good (and warm!)

The food was meh.  It wasn't bad, but it was far from good.  Bland is the best word I can think to use; there really wasn't much flavor to anything.  Additionally, the portions were tiny, easily the smallest amount of food I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the one enchilada (chicken) and one hard taco (beef) lunch special, which came with fried beans and rice.  The plate was three-fourths covered in beans and rice, leaving just enough room for the tiny enchilada, and the taco placed on top of the rice.  There was hardly any cheese on my taco, enchilada or beans.  The taco was full of lettuce, with a tiny amount of beef.  It absolutely was NOT worth the money I paid for my lunch ""special.""  Honestly, you'd get more food going to Taco Bell and ordering a taco, and a beef enchirito  Plus it's way cheaper, and would taste better, too.

Two stars since it wasn't horrible food, and the service was excellent.  For people who can't handle spicy food, or don't like food with flavor, this is the perfect place for lunch or dinner!"
test_1427,"Greenland supermarket is slightly more expensive than 168 and SF for some things, but overall it is nicer and has the widest selection. The food court seems like a plus as well"
test_1428,Poor service. Waited 15 minutes without even being acknowledged.  At 3 other tables received attention. Too many options in Vegas to put up with such poor customer service.
test_1429,Horrible service! They didn't even come and check up on me and my guest! I had to ask my friend for some of their drink because i didn't have anymore! It was all about the money their! Smh ! They need to be closed down!
test_1430,"Great Food, Great Happy Hour, Great Sunday Brunch

Best Fish Taco's in Pittsburgh hands down"
test_1431,"BEST WONTONS EVER. Hands down. Large, plump, juicy, flavorful shrimp exploding from each one. Don't bother with any other noodle toppings--a mistake we made in attempt to diversify our food selection. Just straight up wonton noodles all the way for everyone. You'll thank me later. Very reasonably priced too!"
test_1432,"This restaurant is conveniently located while also in a but of an odd location.

After living in Mississauga for about a year and driving by several times we decided to stop in and we're glad we did. 

We chose from the Taste of Clarkson menu which featured three apps three mains and three desserts to choose from for one price at approximately $37 each.

The grilled goat cheese and beet salad was fresh and expertly presented.  The flank steak was cooked as ordered and surrounded by fresh greens. 

I had the creme brulee which was rich and flavourful (and bigger than expected).

A very good meal at a very good price.  

Service was superb.   Can't wait to go back and try another dish."
test_1433,"The food and service are good, but the overall experience lacks the fine dining feel and a balance of value. 

We had been interested in trying Landry's for some time. When we finally got in, we were quite excited. We were promptly greeted and show to our table. The dining room is REALLY dark. Our server was very nice. A little too casual, but he was doing okay. He knew the menu and the options, so I can say he was on his game as far as server professionalism. 

I had the Surf & Turf, which was good, but not great. The side of asparagus was over cooked and tasted like something gourmet that you tried to cook at home, but didn't get quite right the first time. 

I hate to be too down on the place, but it felt more ""cute"" than welcoming. 
About a week later, we had the same meal at a chain joint and it was twice the quality for 1/3 of the price. We spent the ride home comparing fine dining and casual experiences... it was interesting how we got there.

Landry's feels like a once great restaurant that has stopped investing in linens, silverware, and the accouterments of fine dining presentation. 

I want to try it again in a year or so to see if I can update this review."
test_1434,"In the space of where Kaba curry used to be is Tokyo Kitchen. My normal space for japanese curry is zen which is across the street, so i went with something new. 
The first thing you will notice is the furniture and layout. its very cafe-like and clean. its 2pm on saturday and its calm. it feels like a small retreat from the normal chinatown hustle.
the menu is a bit smaller than other places, but that is not always bad. i did notice chicken katsu missing, but there is always trusty pork katsu. i wanted to try okonomiyaki but it was crossed off the menu. the curry was delicious, but there was a slight difference than other curries. perhaps a different base. 
the attention to plating really does make it feel like from tokyo.
for dessert i had a chocolate banana parfait. the contents were sliced banana, vanilla ice cream, frosted flakes, whipped cream, and crumbled chocolate cake and  chocolate syrup and a chocolate pirouette. altogether very good. i will definitely be coming back."
test_1435,"Spacieux et confortable meme si un peu vieillissant. Tres bon iced latte. Gateaux corrects, meme si pas homemade"
test_1436,"LOVED IT!

Came here with my siblings and nephews. Party of 9 with reservations. We all staggered in but they sat us as we arrived. It was a Thursday so not too busy. But we didn't get menus or bread until everyone arrived though. But at least we had our drinks.

Nice ambiance. Great server. Great food.

Food Breakdown:

Bread: 3 types, a muffin kinda thing which was my favorite! slightly sweet and slighty salty and very soft. pretzel roll. and focaccia bread. comes with butter and horseradish type dip.

Appetizers - Rock Shrimp (tricky tricky... it looks like a big popcorn kinda container full, but its only about 1/3 full, but quite yummy), calamari (delicious! best app we got) and ahi tuna tar tar (yummy). 3 appetizers, plus the bread, was a decent portion for the table.

Main Course: I had the rack of lamb (comes with 4 AMAZING pieces of chop, and the best entree IMO and most of the party thought so too. very rich and flavorful), Filet Mignon bone-in with lobster surf... (if only the lobster was bigger!! but good size of filet and cooked a bit more rare than we ordered, but I loved it! Melts in your mouth delicious.) Kobe Burger (very pretty stack of fries included. an amazing burger, but still.. just a burger.) Porterhouse (HUGE and cooked more to the rare side), Scallops (pretty good and decent portion) - some orders were duplicated

Sides to share: Skinny fries (additive), mac&cheese (not that great), lobster mashed (I had really high expectations for this one and it didn't meet them, but it was good with lots of lobster chunks).

Dessert: specials were the Volcano Chocolate Cake and Chocolate Mousse. Both a disappointment. The chocolate mousse cake was kinda frozen in the center so it was kinda hard, not soft like mousse should be. The volcano cake was nothing special... just the molten cake. Banana split.. cute presentation, and just tasted okay. Wanted to try the smores cause it looked pretty, but we didn't :( In the pictures I saw a picture of like a dessert sampler, but they don't have that. Apparently it is only with preset menus and stuff. Bummer.

Overall? Great place, good service, fabolous food and nice portions. Could be better... especially the desserts, but a fantastic meal. One of the best lamb I've had."
test_1437,"I have no idea how the food tastes. We were here for over ninety five minutes and all that arrived were my finance's dinner and his appetizer. My food never arrived and fully thirty minutes after telling us it was given to another table (that complained because I made a modification), I still wasn't given anything. At that point, I cancelled my order. His meal came without soup and salad, so I did request he get those sent, too. Then it was another fifteen minutes for the bill and still fifteen minutes later, we were waiting for our change. At that point, I requested the money back, put down the exact amount including tip, and we left. The server was running around, and it was clear that the problems were in the kitchen. Our meal should have been comped. We will never be back."
test_1438,"The store itself is okay, but don't go here for a gel manicure. First of all, it's $35, which is more than most other places in the area. This would be fine if there was exceptional service, but the service and other places is better as well. There are no swatches of the colors, so you have to rely on the top of the bottle color and opening the bottle, which isn't very accurate. The girl spent a lot of time trying to sell me on other products, which I understand because I've been in sales before, but it didn't make the experience any more pleasant. Finally, the final product looked really bad. When I got outside and looked in the sunlight, there were literally parts of every nail that did not have any top coat on it, causing craters on the nail. I should have said something at the time, but it's really hard to tell somebody to their face that what they just did looks awful. I'm going to have to either fix it or just take it off myself. Next time I will just go to another salon in the area."
test_1439,"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend. We came here right when it opened at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty busy. For an AYCE restaurant, I would give it a 3.5 if I could but I'll rate it on the higher end to a 4.0. Our items came out all at once and the server always filled our tea/water right away. The sashimi was fresh, however cut a little on the thicker side, some pieces were also weirdly cut like a diamond. The concept of the rolls were tasty but the rice used was a little too soft so it was mushy when you put it in your mouth. Most of the cooked items tasted decent however the portion sizes were much smaller than the usual buffet size. I was looking forward to the beef ribs but they came out overcooked and oily..pretty disappointed here. I must comment on the service, the sushi chefs and servers were friendly and attentive which is rare for an all you can eat restaurant. I would probably come back if I'm ever in the area."
test_1440,Overcharged me then didn't refund me because they were 'busy' food was awful and way under portioned. If you are in the area I highly recommend a street rat medium rare rather then Ill Gut I mean Grill Hut!!
test_1441,"This place has the usual high quality ice cream to be expected from Baskin & Robbins ice cream outlets. The service is fast & efficient, the area is bright & spacious.

Pointers for improvements: the servers should smile more & be more welcoming if they want repeat business, and the floors can also get a better cleaning. Overall okay, I will come back for the ice cream, with the possibility of becoming a regular if they improve their overall customer service experience."
test_1442,"Love the drinks and Katie! The drinks are strong and actually give you a nice buzz without making you sick off sugar like the other daiquiri places. Katie is one of their main bartenders and she's amazing! Very nice, friendly and smart! We will be back for more!!!"
test_1443,"Wow what a bummer!! We used to really love this place and would take people here all the time.

This last time the owner really dropped the ball by super inappropriately handling a situation, embarrassing our table and being confrontational over how a steak was cooked!

Bottom line is 4 dinners ordered, 2 steaks came in beyond rare, blue rare we will call it. Sent them back and assumed they would fire new steaks like most decent steakhouses would. They did not. They retired the same steaks (which had mushroom sauces all over them) and burnt them. They tasted like ass. So we told the waitress the deal, she went and talked to the owner and came back and said ""the owner is taking care of your meal and a new one will be out"". Cool. No problem, things happen.

Out comes a perfect steak but unfortunately everyone was done eating. Took a few bites and put it in the to go box. We all know how awesome a reheated bone in ribeye is. Not.

Bill comes. Nothing taken off. Even charged more to add peopercorns to the steak! 

Told the waitress. She got the manager, Mandi. Who was about as helpful as boobs on a log. She literally said to us ""I came over because the owner doesn't like to deal with these situations and talk to people directly"". LOL! Wow. Ok Mandi, just take this off our bill. She couldn't and had to get the owner. This is where it got stupid.

Owner comes over and is confrontational. Says the first steak should have been perfect since it was medium rare. Everyone at the table agreed it was rare beyond belief and cold in the middle! We weren't gonna agree so avoid having an argument with the owner on a Saturday evening!

 I just said ""look I wouldn't have waited to eat after everyone else did if the server didn't tell me you were taking care of it"". Then he told me basically why should I buy your steak if it finally came out great at the end. Uh....because you're in the f'n service industry jackass and I send people here all the time and live in the neighborhood. The whole table couldn't believe it.

They literally took the to go container we had with various leftovers, removed the Offending Ribeye in question and then gave it back and removed it from the tab. No apology, nothing.

Tip for the owner: Look up ""cost of doing business"" you lost 4 regulars last night that spend $300 each in your bars on a regular basis each month. Over a $10 food cost. As a business owner myself I think you're a damned idiot.

Will be back, once, to use this groupon. Then we will start trying other places. If it's amazing the way it used to be next time I will put the review back how it was."
test_1444,Where do I begin? There were 3 in my party. When we arrived I was told there will only take 15 to 20 minutes to be seated. So my grandson husband and I waited. 15 goes by. 20 goes by.  30 mins go by. Ok so at this point I go up to the hostess. And wouldn't you know they had tables and a booth available. The hostess was a little mouthy and rolling her eyes. At that point I should have left. My husband ordered a beer and they forgot to bring it. I order my burger well done and it was pink. I'm the type of customer that does not send anything back. My grandson loved his sloppy joe. Our waiter was great. It was our first and last time.
test_1445,"Been here several times and each time I am greeted with the same warm smiles. For some odd coincidence, both times I was looking for costumes. Long story short........TOGA PARTY! Ok, maybe one of them was a toga party. Anyways, these guys here seem to know what they are doing because for every question I had, they were able to help me and lead me to the right section.

My second time coming here I had to find a costume for my son. As you can see from some of the pics, he was looking at masks and weird hat combinations. Needless to say we ended up ordering a master chief outfit for he has the helmet for it. Maybe I can put him to work on the strip getting tips form tourists taking pics with him.

I gotta say this place is probably one of the bigger locations. They keep it well kept and organized. Hats off to the crew here (literally because they got tons of them). Any time I need any kind of costume awkward or not, you guys are my go to place.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #76"
test_1446,"I'm absolutely in love with the place, food, ambience, staff and services. They were extremely accommodating for my picky food choices- without compromising on the quality. I'm going to be a regular here!!! My group and I were so much into food that we didn't click pictures- just dug right into the food. Well, shall post pictures next time on. We had ordered dosas, rice, schezwan and manchow soup."
test_1447,"Southwest Seas has stellar customer service.  We've been using their service for years now and they are always on time.  Our aquarium looks amazing and whenever we need them to help, they are prompt to respond.  I recommend them for service and installation!"
test_1448,New favorite restaurant for Peruvian Food! The moment we walked in the greetings were welcoming along with the assault on the senses of great food! :) My Mom and I both agree!
test_1449,"I wish I could give them negative stars because they suck badly. The food is really bad, I mean you smell it and you want to throw up. My sister ordered some plum wine and the glass had lipstick on it, so he brings out a different glass with probably the same wine and it also had finger prints. My sister ordered the dynamite sushi bowl and right away it smelled so fishy that I asked her to move it away from me. I was sitting outside and the wind was blowing the fishy smell towards me. The guy said he wouldn't charge her for it.  Also you are supposed to get miso soup with all of your meals but we never got it. The worst part is my girlfriend and her son got sick. All they got was a chicken teriyaki bowl and her son was pooping green. I guess that would be mild food poisoning. It's funny but I think that they changed their name to KB sushi grill. The service was so crappy, we had to stand up in order to signal that we wanted our check."
test_1450,Lynette did a great job with my Dermaplaning and photo facial. I leave looking like a new person.
test_1451,great buffet lots of food choices and the ice cream was delicious .i will definitely be back
test_1452,This business is not ADA wheelchair  accessible or ADA compliant. It would be interesting to see what building codes were applied and used.
test_1453,Was skeptical with it being in a gas station bit was one of the best Mexican restaurant I have had in a while.
test_1454,Love this place will eat this place if near here the only thing that gets me is the staff they need to smile more to there customers ps one staff member needs to stand up straight.
test_1455,"I don't get all the hype about the food? I came for a car wash and some breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito and it was less than impressive. The coffee tasted like mud, no matter the amount of sugar and cream I loaded into my cup and I wound up tossing it after 2 sips. The staff wasn't exactly friendly either. At 8am on a Saturday, the place wasn't exactly busy yet everyone did their  best to avoid eye contact or offer assistance of any kind.

The car wash was great though. Make sure to check in on Yelp and get $5 off."
test_1456,"Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner."
test_1457,"Mark is the real deal! He's obviously been around the business for awhile but he still makes you feel comfortable and explains things so anyone could understand. He was very thorough and made sure we knew everything about the house we were looking at.

If you don't know who to go with here in the Valley, use these guys for your inspection, you won't regret it!"
test_1458,"Such  bad service is very hard to find nowadays in toronto!
Not in KiKu or Sushi on 7 or Suygon.

Today go there at 1:38 pm no greeter, 15 min guy wear suite pass by and said wait then go away. Not till 2 pm we were told seat will be really soon behind us there is people like us not being serve at all.  Start or first order at 215.  Wait long 20min finally food on table . Keep searching for server to make the second order.  All together we got 3 chances to make order and a girl come by !  !! we were eating!,!  and told us it is the last call. We make our final order and also remind her some food not coming yet.  OK she soon bring the food to us.  Not more  than ten minutes server bring in a bill and put on the table ,,,Thank you she said Tips included She added! When I ask her if  I can paid credit card Serer said go to the cashier to paid.  There was a long line.  When we go back to our seat, all our food on the table gone!  Including my desert.  All above are poor customer service and is totally unacceptable.  Their manager call Fanny, cant get hold with her.  Wow,  it is very reasonable to acknowledge food not finished most not even start to eat.  I would say they intentionally to do that.  Is there something wrong with the restaurant that they don't want customer any more or they treat the server badly to make them bad to customer in return."
test_1459,"Freshly baked pizza while you wait for your flight. It wasn't memorable. But very filling. As one person reviewed, the cheese was fresh. Upside, charging stations are built into some of the bartops."
test_1460,Everything I've had here has been very good! The chocolate cakes was amazing.. Great choice of macarons and good price. The quiches are also delicious!
test_1461,"BEST. LUNCH. EVER.

If you are visiting Vegas, Milos is an ABSOLUTE eatery destination that is not to be missed.  Seriously.  You won't get a 3 course lunch that is THIS good for $20.   The space is beautiful, the bread is heavenly, and the food was nothing short of fabulous.  I had the appetizer sampler, which showcased their pita bread with a few different dips [hummus, cheese, etc.], their seared SEA BASS, and walnut cake for dessert.  

They are known for their seafood here at the restaurant, so if you get a chance, don't skip out on their catches.  The sea bass that I had was prepared simply- but it was super awesome because it didn't take anything away from the delicate flavor of the fish.  If i had to be completely honest, dessert was kind of a throwaway since they ran out of a lot of the other stuff, so I was kind of cornered into getting the walnut cake.  It was moist and reminded me of carrot cake... but I wasn't a big fan.

Service was impeccable, and I'm almost kicking myself for even writing a review because I don't want people to know about this place... but it's so amazing you HAVE to go."
test_1462,"I was there because I heard my friend saying that there's finally a bubble tea inside UofT! Yeah!!!
But it turns out that I didn't get bubble tea, instead I got the the whole grape fruit juice drink. It is truely refreshing, and very suitable to drink during the hard time study at Robarts library!
My friend said that the signature jasmine green cheesy tea is also very good, so I'm definitely gonna try that for the next time."
test_1463,"This being my first time here I was super nervous only because I have been going to the same barber for about 9 years. Favio was very welcoming from the time I walked into the door, also acknowledging my appointment. I showed him the cut I wanted and he did a stunning job. I've been to two other shops, but their listening skills were not so great. Favio is going to be my new barber from now on. Every penny well spent!"
test_1464,"Brought in the New a year at low key and it was the best New Year's Eve yet!!! Great music, great service, good drinks and a lively atmosphere! Really good place to bring a date. Music isn't so loud that you can actually talk. 
I only make reviews on here when I have a really good experience or a really bad one. This is one of the good times. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time."
test_1465,"Made a reservation here on 02/22/18. When we walked in we were promptly seated and greeted by someone who wasn't our server but got us started on water. The decor was neat and the menu was short and to the point.

We ordered the sweet potato soup which was amazing and piping hot! We also ordered the turkey meatballs but they came out cold in the center, they tasted alright though so we didn't bother to send them back, just wish they would've been hot.

For the main dish my boyfriend and I ordered an ahi tuna salad which was delicious! (But a very small portion size!) and the chicken curry, which was also a small portion size. The chicken curry was good except it was served with some sort of crunchy flatbread that wasn't complimenting to the dish. Also there were large chunks of bone in the curry which is to be expected, however it seemed like every other piece had a bone!

My boyfriend loved the cucumber mocktail, so much so he ordered two! 

Overall, this place is decent for the price, however your experience can go widely different directions based on you order. Or you can do as we did and order a couple things to share just in case some dishes aren't up to par. I may return to this restaurant but in a city like Vegas it isn't on the top of my list."
test_1466,"My husband and I love Jewels. The food is amazing, you would never guess it was GF. I love that they now serve their breakfast menu all day. I had the breakfast platter with sausage today, the sausage was yummy."
test_1467,"So let me start off by saying the food is absolutely amazing....amazing....however I will never ever go back her.  It was my sister's 21st birthday, we had a group of 12 of us.  We were a little late for our reservation but we called them and they said they were fine with us being a little late.  

We were seated in Jennifer's section, it took her ten minutes to come get our drink orders.  There were three two tops sat in our section after us, and she got their drinks out first.  We waited for our food to be brought out for 45 minutes, and no she didn't communicate what was going on in the kitchen.  A simple ""I am so sorry we are slammed"" or she could have brought out our salads, but of course not.  Then we finally got our dinner.  She dropped our plates and left, didn't ask us if we needed any condiments or anything else.  Thank god the bus boy was filling our waters.  We ordered another round of drinks and that took about 20 minutes to get.  Then we requested for the check..............30 minutes later still no check.  I spoke to the manager, still no check, waited another 5 minutes still no check.  Finally the check came and we split it up quickly..... . . . . . . .  . it took her 8 minutes to run the bill, 3/4 cash the rest on ONE CARD.  8 minutes....8 minutes to close out the bill???? of course she didn't apologize for how ridiculously useless and neglecting she was.  I feel like because she got an automatic gratuity she thinks she can give us crappy service.  She doesn't deserve an 18% tip, she barely deserves a 5% tip.  Manager didn't handle it well, and it was a crappy way to start the birthday girl's night.  I hope they get a new manager and staff otherwise, no matter how wonderful their food is everyone will avoid this place like a plague.  Jennifer you seriously suck and I have no idea how you even have a serving job, you couldn't serve a horse a carrot if you wanted to."
test_1468,"OMG!!! This restaurant is so busy!!! And the food is amazingly good!!! After you try Island Style food you will understand why... If you are in the mood for some Korean Hawaiian, Korean Chinese food I totally recommend this place."
test_1469,Came to Yardbird with high expectations after seeing it on television. I was extremely happy with my dining experience. I ordered the chicken and waffle which was packing with flavor! The chicken was nicely crisp and the waffle had a nice balance of sweet and savory flavors. Can't wait to check out the Miami location!
test_1470,I like the decor! They also have a lot of selection. The martinis are great. In one order I had about 12 sweet potato rolls. Awesome. Easy to go to a bar after since is right on W 6th.
test_1471,"Terrible service! very rude customer service agents that answer the calls. I have been calling about the same property for months and no response or actions from this agency. Its terrible to be a homeowner and tax payer and you can get no assistance from this agency.

Home owner allows dogs to bark non stop and when we are trying to enjoy our backyard we cant due to the dogs barking non stop with the homeowner sitting there allowing this to happen. We were doing some yard work and repairing a fence and my nephew was standing on the wall and the dog owner was calling commands to the dogs and allowing them to try and bite my nephew standing on the wall! I called animal control on Monday and was told an officer would come meet with me, It is now Wednesday and I was told Tuesday night this is not a priority! Really so its OK for someone to try and get your dogs to attack someone while you are sitting there calling commands! Unreal! So when someone gets hurt then it will be an issue? 

Sad to be a tax payer and can't get no help from Metro or Animal control. This person is an issue to the neighbor hood, He has cameras facing into my pool area and metro cant do anything then this dog issue and animal control wont even respond. The dogs are pit bull and we cant get any help, if anything happens whom is going to be held responsible? I will not be held liable when animal control will not address an issue that is going to become a bigger issue eventually. So Sad . Thanks for all your rude agents and lack of response for something that is your job!"
test_1472,"If I was just reviewing the food, I'd give KooKoo a full 5 stars without hesitation. Their chicken is perfectly crisp, incredibly fresh, and never very oily. The 20 minute waiting time isn't a problem, especially when you're getting such great chicken. The restaurant has even placed 6 shaker bottles on each table (Seaweed, Chili, etc.), which I think is quite cute, but I prefer the chicken as it is. The KooKoo bites are my personal favourite! 

Also, the taro smoothie is hands-down the best  I've ever had (like, in my life). I'd drink it more often, but too bad it only comes in a large size I can never seem to finish alone.  

The only reason I'm stripping KooKoo of their full s5 tars is because the food is a tad more pricey than other food of its sort. But it's totally worth it once in a while. 

The completely arbitrary and random wall-decor always makes me laugh. (I miss you because I never miss you). 

KooKoo's a great place that you should definitely try if you're a fried chicken connaisseur :)"
test_1473,Ordered a Chorizo super burrito and a Chorizo soft taco for delivery.  The soft taco was delicious.  The Chorizo in the burrito was singed and had a burnt smoky flavor to it.  Overdone.
test_1474,"We love this place!!

they remember me every time I walk in the door!

prices are right in the ballpark and portions are generous!

best for take out - no real atmosphere for eating in......"
test_1475,This ramen restaurant is fantastic!! They have your traditional and so many other kinds. The gentleman was so helpful with any questions we had about the menu. This place is great!
test_1476,"My car was hit while I was parked on my street, and the responsible insurance company (State Farm) covered the damage. Penn Auto was one of their recommended shops, so I went with them. I was absolutely blown away by their service. When I first got in touch with them, they were able to get me in the next morning before work (at 7 a.m.) which is a huge plus for me, to get my estimate. I was in and out in about ten minutes, and we scheduled to get my car in about two weeks later, which was fine with me - the car was drivable. The next week, though, I discovered a screw in one of my tires (unrelated to the accident) - they, again, were able to get me in the next morning before work. He repaired my tire within 20 minutes, and didn't charge me anything for the repair. I took my car in for the repairs the next Monday - they gave me a loaner car for the week, because the insurance didn't cover a rental. The car was done by Thursday, and it was great. It looked as if nothing had ever happened to the car. They also fixed a couple of scratches for no extra charge. Everyone was really friendly, as well. I would absolutely recommend their service to anyone and everyone."
test_1477,"Nothing beats walking down the street eating a croissant or sandwich.  It's sheer heaven.  I pulled the croissant from Fous Desserts out of its wax paper bag and I slowly took a bite. My nostrils flared as I paused to get my mind around what I was experiencing.  Flaky, light texture, yet moelleux, soft.  The butter.  Was. Evident.  But not like buttery.  I don't know how to explain it.  It was as if butter had been raised to an angelic state and gently blessed this croissant with its essence.  There is no other way to describe it.  This croissant was perfect.  So I know that I said that comparing Montreal and Paris was useless, but this fucking croissant was better than even the ones I've had in Paris.  For one thing, it was bigger.  Not much bigger, but maybe 5% bigger.  There was more exquisiteness to enjoy.  But never had I tasted something that harmonized the delightful savory/sweet balance of the croissant so perfectly.  It was a cloud with butter.  It was pastry with wings.  It was delicious!

You can read the rest of my review of this place at my blog.  It was good enough to blog about!  http://www.spiritcentric.com/montreal-delights-fous-desserts/"

test_1479,"Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm ""snap"" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future."
test_1480,"After reading through about 30 different pris fixe menus for restaurant week, my friends and I decided on Bonterra. Other menus were fairly simplistic, but this one stood out as really creative.

I had been here before for a dining competition, but it's been so long I couldn't remember if Bonterra was a competitor (it was an awesome evening though).

First let's talk about the wine list - amazing - extensive and somehow the waiters here really know the ""ins and outs"" of the wines. Our first bottle was a really fantastic Pinot Noir from Cali ($36) - nice choice John! I chose the second one, a Chilean Cab ($36) which was equally as rockin' - nice choice me! I left with a new appreciation for wine.

We each made sure to get something different so we could taste each other's dishes. My starter was the St Louis style ribs served with house made bread and butter pickles  - whoa baby - I could have eaten a full rack - for a non BBQ place - they nailed them! The shrimp, heirloom tomato and charcuterie starters were all good!

My filet was a perfect medium rare - whoever works the meat station here is the man!
The deconstructed Salted Caramel cheesecake was pure melt in your mouth silky creamy goodness - loved the homemade crust as a cookie served on the side.

Our waiter, Kerry, was a supreme gentleman with a great sense of humor. We were part of the last seating for the evening, so we really got to take our time and enjoy ourselves!"
test_1481,"Dull customer service. Forces you to get insurance even though we told them twice we didn't want it. Just took the insurance to make them shut up.
With Insurance it doubled our quote for the vehicle."
test_1482,I bent my classic round ray bans (everything is metal) brought them in and the guy seriously took them in the back and fixed them in under 5 minutes free of charge. Super good customer service and he was super nice. I tried to tip him but he wouldn't let me haha. If we ever actually break any glasses of ours we will definitely bring them to this guy.
test_1483,"I used to LOVE this location, but now I will NEVER go back.  I was here this evening with two of my colleagues. One of them had black stuff in her drink and a green bug crawling in her bowl. In hindsight, this is when we should have left. My colleague  got a replacement drink and an entire new meal. A few minutes later we noticed a roach. Yes a ROACH crawling on the chair next to us. That was it, we got our purses and headed out. The part that got me is how nonchalant the manager was about the roach. She did validate as customers we had every right to complain to headquarters, which I will be doing tomorrow. It's disappointing how this location has gone down. I hope the do a proper cleaning and extermination so nothing seriously happens to a customer. This will be my last time going to this location."
test_1484,"I found this place on the internet and thought I would give it a try. I will be taking my vehicles here from now on. I was greeted by the owner, Randy, with a smile and a handshake in the parking lot. He walked me in to the lobby and introduced me to Dominic who helped me set up my service. Randy then drove me home as my truck was being serviced. All during the service I was emailed and texted with updates. When it was done, Randy picked me up and brought me to the shop. The price was very fair and reasonable. Needless to say, I'm very impressed. I've never been to a garage like this before."
test_1485,"I would like to thank Dr. Banfield and the entire staff at Apex Endodontics for such an amazing visit! From the moment I walked in until the moment I left, I felt so comfortable and not anxious at all. Thanks for a wonderful visit!"
test_1486,"We eat lunch here at least once if not three times a month.  The monday lunch special pulled pork sandwich.  What we really like is the zippy bbq sauce, different sides and ice cone for desert."
test_1487,"Yeah, baby!

This place was terrific. The service was spot on. Friendly, helpful, and on it.  

We ended up with a mix of dishes; the rolls were unique, tasty and decently priced for Vegas. The BBQ duck breast was really great. Not too chewy and a great to split. And the yellowtail ceviche was a big surprise; awesome to taste with the right amount of sweet and tangy. 

The shishito peppers were a big hit as well. Though there was a spicy one in the mix! 

Overall, we really enjoyed this place."
test_1488,"I went on a Sunday of the long weekend in Sept (2014). It was a beautiful day and we wanted to sit on their lovely front patio. There was a 15 min wait and no one came to write down our name or ask how many people were in our party while we waited. Luckily we were only 2 and they were able to literally squeeze us in which later made it hard for us and others to get in a a out of our seats. But once seated it was cozy and comfortable. There was also shade which was nice. 

Only seemed to be one waiter and he was running around. It took him some time to get our order & he was abrupt (had that French attitude). I ordered a latte and it came quickly in a tall glass and was perfect! 

I also ordered eggs Benny which took a long time to come. We had to mention that we had ordered some time ago when a staff member came by. 

The table next to us was also waiting for quite some time and they got a free pastry (we did not and I was disappointed). 

Overall the food was good and the patio was lovely albeit tight fit. 

The decor inside which I only saw when I went to use the bathroom was so charming and made me think of a Parisian cafe. But I was glad not to be sitting inside on such a hot day as they didn't seem to have the a/c on. Perhaps because it's an old house that has been repurposed? 

Go with patience in mind for the service and the time it takes to get your food. Savour it. I would go again but perhaps just for a nice coffee and pastry. Or for food if I had a lot of time:)"
test_1489,Omg worst service ever. Went there to get some sweets and the girl attitude was so bad. She was so bad that she even told someone else to help us because she couldn't handle us. Her attitude was so bad. She didn't even apologize which was why that made her the worst customer service ever. I like the old staff at the old location before.
test_1490,"Here for a work lunch, I was excited to finally get a chance to try Vintner Grill.

We arrived before the lunch crowd and were seated quickly. The restaurant is adorable and I enjoyed the table settings quite a bit. We started with bread service and everyone recommended the pretzel bread but I can never turn down olive bread so I went with that. 

I ordered the lunch portion of halibut and it was delicious. Superbly cooked and I could have easily devoured the full portion if I had ordered it. 

While I had attempted to eat relatively healthy for lunch, we decided to splurge for dessert and I couldn't say no trying all the options we ordered. We ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake with pistachio gelato and honey, lemon & raspberry panna cotta and banana strudel. The cheesecake and panna cotta were the stars of the show. They were both so delicious and silky, I had to try my best to resist taking too many samples. 

Our lunch was great and the service lived up to our expectations as well. I look forward to coming back again soon for lunch and possibly to try their dinner options as well."
test_1491,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Shania and her staff are phenomenal. I am always satisfied with my results, I am a Brazilian regular! She makes it as comfortable and easy as can be. We have such great talks during that time, I'm always done before our conversation is...lol She walks through the whole process and makes it a painless as possible. The shop is super clean and so adorable. You will not find another shop that gives you the professionalism and friendly atmosphere that you get here!"
test_1492,"I was struggling on the rating of this casino because everyone in the group won some money, but the customer service we received from the servers was pretty bad. You can No longer get drunk while gambling since the server come and check up on you every 30 minutes and they only bring you 1 drink at a time. We wanted to continue gambling but wanted to drink as well so we opted out to go to a bar instead. Every time you ordered a drink the server asked, are you playing and are you going to continue to play. Even when we tipped they were still rude. And every server feels so entitled to tips, even with their shitty attitude!"
test_1493,Bad customer service and not much product in stock.
test_1494,"A family friend took me here and I was not impressed. This is a small, probably family-run Filipino establishment. Although you can see that the staff sincerely cares about the customers and the food, cleanliness can be improved. The tables aren't the cleanest. The buffet table doesn't seem that clean either. There aren't labels for the food; as a person with food allergies, it's a problem. The 7am crowd is made up of Filipino cab drivers getting ready for their morning shift. There is plenty of just-add-water coffee for each person to make for them self. If I wasn't with a regular at the restaurant that personally knows the staff, I don't think my experience would have been as enjoyable. Overall, I don't think I will be returning to this establishment. If they work on cleanliness and labeling the food, I'd consider returning. Even though I didn't thoroughly enjoy my first experience here, I'm still rooting for this hole-in-the-wall restaurant because of the caring and friendly staff."
test_1495,Nothing really special about this ramen but the appetizers were pretty good. The setting of the restaurant was more enjoyable.
test_1496,Great place for watching the Jays.   Food and beer selection and quality are very good.   Staff was attentive.   Stephanie and Josh were terrific.   Confusion about reservation was handled well.
test_1497,"slow service, and limited beer selection.   
Overpriced as well, just because its in an airport doesn't mean they should be adding a premium to alcohol."
test_1498,"I've had a few less-than-ideal experiences with Baum Blvd Automotive and will have to pass on going there again.

The first time, I bought some tires from Tire Rack to be installed at Baum. They called me when they arrived and I swung by to get the new tires installed. I gave them my keys, and before I left, I asked if they had an idea on when my car might be done. The guy seemed incredibly irritated and he said they couldn't tell me that, as if it were a completely ridiculous thing to ask. I didn't need to know the time down to the minute; I was just trying to get an idea of when the work would be complete. I don't know. Maybe he was having a bad day, but it really came across as rude. Ultimately the work was done fine, but I came away feeling pretty crappy about my experience.

The second time, my girlfriend took her car to get a state and emissions inspection. They passed the car for emissions (but wrote the wrong VIN on the sticker... :-/) and failed it for safety. They claimed that it would require about $900 worth of work to get it to pass inspection, which I was very suspicious of. We took it to Walter's down the street and showed them the inspection notes from Baum. It did fail inspection at Walter's, too, but as I suspected, some of the things that Baum failed the car for were pretty bogus. $480 in repairs from Walter's later, the car was back in business.

Between rude employees and obvious upselling, I can't really recommend Baum Boulevard to anyone when there are quality places like Walter's and Morningside Auto nearby. If your car needs work, take it to one of those places instead."
test_1499,"OMG my sister and myself just had the most wonderful massage in our lives at Sam's Spa by Ana and Joyce.  This was an oriental massage where the two of us were in the same room with our feet first being soaked (detox) while they did DEEP head, neck and shoulder massage. After about 20 minutes they removed our feet from the bucket of warm water, dried them off and started a stone massage on our feet and legs.  It was deep, which I like, and found spots that needed to be worked out.  Then pressure massage on our thighs with clothes on and a towel to keep it clean and not too personal.  Then flipped us and then we took off our tops when then did a 30 minute stone and hand massage.  I was about ready to call Uncle (stop) when she finished on me personally.  The two masseuse left the room where we put our tops back on in privacy.  My sister is visiting from Florida and was a masseuse for 15 years and said they were deeper and more incredible than she was taught or had ever experienced herself.  I highly recommend this very clean facility located just east of Rainbow in the Walmart Shopping Center.  It sounds like I own the place but I don't.  However, I did schedule another appointment already for next week.  All that for $39 plus tip.  A great deal!"
test_1500,"To be perfectly honest, I've only had the mushroom soup. Mostly because it is the most delicious soup I have ever eaten. It's so rich and 'meaty' (with no meat-meat, just 'shroom meat) that I just can't help but order it everytime I go there.

It has been a while but the last few times I went, my soup came with a home made biscuit (aweeeeesome) with some sort of home made red pepper jelly (awesomely delicious).

There are now two convenient locations - one at Adelaide and John and another at Queen and Dovercourt. yumyumyum!

GO HERE. You will be drifted away to soupy goodness..."
test_1501,"We are from Virginia (in Phoenix for a conference) so we have been fortunate enough to taste some amazing BBQ from North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.  I have to say Little Miss BBQ ranks right up there with the best of the best.

The brisket melts in your mouth.  The sides are out if this world, especially the tangy potato salad.

Totally worth the drive and the wait"
test_1502,Everytime we come to Vegas this is our spot!! We come for breakfast and sometimes even come back after hours!! We never ordered anything that wasn't good! Portions are soo huge big enough to share unless your a fatass!
test_1503,Fajita Quesdilla was huge but the cheese didn't have much taste.  Great location & good service.  Salads are huge.  Standard pub fare.
test_1504,Very good been looking for a good place for fry bread and I believe I've found one. Service was great very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend it. Just don't come to late. I was unfortunate and missed out on the green Chile.
test_1505,"Simply the best pizza in Bradford! Tons of toppings, great taste, competitive prices, and friendly staff. Check their website for the deals. We typically get the Double Up Special which includes 6 toppings between two pizzas. I find even having two toppings on one pizza more than enough as they are really generous with them! Overall a fantastic pizza joint!"
test_1506,This is a nice small place to grab some breakfast on the patio.  Their coffee is great and I usually get their breakfast burrito.  The breakfast burrito is on the small side but definitely plenty enough to get you going.  It's served with a fresh cilantro sauce.  The patio is very dog friendly which I love if your pup is a friendly one.  Leave the grumpy ones at home!  Nothing worse then trying to enjoy your meal and a dog fight breaks out right next to you.
test_1507,Went here to eat yesterday night... Not having reservation makes it tuff to just go anyplace and eat but it's New Years Eve and I can understand.
test_1508,"The food tasted great and I loved the decor.  They have a 12,000 lb black granite panda wearing a sombrero.  That was too cool.  The food was great and not expensive, but the menu was a disaster and you had to study how to write in the proper codes before you could order.  This really wasn't needed as we were the only people in line.  Also I got sick after eating this junk, it only last for ~4hours but it still sucked."
test_1509,"Everything was great, from the non-commission sales staff and being able to take our time looking at all the different styles of sofas and not being hounded by salespeople. To the wide open sales floor, the sales floor wasn't cramped or hard to move around.  Thomas our salesman was great, he answered all our questions and after answering my question he was not pushy at all about if we were going to purchase the furniture.

Only issue I had they never called to tell me my 3 hour window for delivery."
test_1510,"Heard great things about this place, eager to try it, but very disappointed. First off, the ordering process was extremely tedious. Tried to place an order online but frustrating so called in an order instead -- the menu items listed on the website aren't what the man said they were on the phone. More importantly, the food was just terrible. The crispy eggrolls were greasy and the filling was mealy and tasted off. The ""crispy"" pork over rice (listed as a favorite on the menu) was inedible. It was about as far away from crispy as it could get -- gummy, greasy, a mass of fat, with shards of bone. I ended up spitting it out and throwing it away. The Singapore chow mei fun was ok, but rather dry and the shrimp was flavorless. Wah Kee, also in town, has something similar, and it is worlds better. The beef chow fun in black bean sauce wasn't bad, the meat was relatively tender, and the noodles were authentic, but it was still a bit greasy and could have had more flavor. All in all extremely disappointed by this restaurant and won't be going back."
test_1511,"Cool place to relax and more family oriented. Not the place to come if you're one of those types who wanna ""see and be seen"" like those cesspools of nastiness at the better known pools (Rehab, Wet Republic, etc) which is totally fine with me!

Pool Attendants were great, always checking up if we needed anything, and totally took care of us throughout the day.

Only one pool and a hot tub there, but there are a lot of loungers and ample shaded areas. Hours are 9am-5pm with a $5 cover for locals on Weekends, pool attendant didn't charge us though, and towels are also provided. Water bottles are allowed and their drinks were okay as was their pizza which was from inside the food court.

Looking for a place to unwind without the party scene? Check this place out...ALOHA!!!"
test_1512,"They have the most authentic Taiwanese (and some Chinese) food in Pittsburgh metro area. Their beef noodle soup is comparable to the one you can get from Chinatown, NYC! Other than various deliciously drooling entrees, their appetizers and soup selections are also go-die-for, highly recommending the marinated duck!"
test_1513,"This is one of our happy hour group's favorite spots! We try different places all over the city, but always continue to come back here. The drinks and the food are great. I think I've tried everything off of the happy hour menu, and it all is delicious! The Carpaccio and Mushroom Ravioloi are my favs :)"
test_1514,This was a fun way to spend a couple hours in Vegas. The actors are funny and don't make you feel embarrassed when you have to interact. In the end you find out if you have what it takes to be part of the mob family. Good luck! Overall good time and learned a bunch about the history of mob and Vegas.
test_1515,Really an excellent place for a few drinks and an unusually diverse bar fair.  I enjoyed it very much.  Excellent experience !
test_1516,"Favorite pizza place in Cleveland Heights! I love the unique topping combinations. Currently, ""The Bombay"" and ""The Chicago"" are my usuals. It's a bit on the pricier side but you get what you pay for: quality pizza, loaded with fun toppings."
test_1517,"i came here today to finally get my dog washed and I really loved the place. it's the like whole foods supermarket for pets. so much ""natural"" dog food and all kinds of dog related stuff. they pretty much provide everything for u; blowdryers, towels, shampoos, body sprays, etc. their doggy tubs are pretty cool too. my dog usually goes crazy w/ other small dogs but he was pretty relaxed in here, he loved the water bath temperature. I will definitely come back, I would have given it 5 stars but I was a bit perturbed at the younger woman who looked like in her mid 20s because she didn't acknowledge me while I came in...I was waiting and waiting for her to help me but she just kept talking to one customer for freaking forever!!! she could've atleast said i'll be right there with u...but nothing and to top it off, once the other customer left, she just left and went inside in the grooming room passing me w/out even saying anything...I waited and waited and finally I just had to ask another lady to help me. argh what the hell? the older guy vacuuming the fur and older woman by the register are very accommodating and so nice, I would come back because of them."
test_1518,Shuttle came quick but line to get the rental was excruciatingly slow! I'll stick with enterprise from now on.
test_1519,"My boyfriend & his parents, all of us being huge fans of Guy, we're so excited to eat at his restaurant. But what a disappointment! Of all the yummy things he talks about and knows how to make, let alone Mac n cheese on a burger, why was there such a dull, tasteless and small serving on it? And two small strips of bacon? Nothing on the menu was over the top or anything to write home about. The fries were delicious. Just really expected more. I'm disappointed in you, Guy!!!!!!!!"
test_1520,"I have been going here for about 10 years mostly for the convenience and how quick they are. Recently I went there and got the SNS manicure and got a fungus. I feel that this shouldn't happen in a place that practices clean procedures. I now question if they are sanitary. 

That was enough to make me stop going there coupled with the fact that their front desk customer service is below par."
test_1521,"I just fell in love with this place.

Great staff, friendly and kind. Bianco was in da' house which added up extra kuddos to the place, specially because one would think that now that he's a rock star he would be arrogant but all the contrary, he was super pleasant and down to earth.

I had the specials of the day which were delicious. Watermelon salad and gnocci with meat. 

The gnocci were my very favorite, what a dish! 

The desert was made by Bianco's mother herself, which was also superb! A banana tiramisu-like cake that was one of the best deserts I've had lately. 

Apparently, Bianco's mother brings desert on Thursdays, keep that in mind.

I tried the wise guy pizza which was also excellent.

I'll be back within two weeks.

If that wasn't enough, the decor and charm of the place is outstanding. Rustic with a touch of elegant.

If I have to define Bianco's concepts I would say he trims the BS and focuses in food quality, which is pretty hard to find, specially in AZ.

An instant favorite for me, for sure.

Cheers!"
test_1522,"First time i am giving a Fox Restaurant such a low rating.

Really was not at all impressed by the dishes. My food was in the luke warm family when i got it. I really don't mind luke warm food. It's nice cause i can just start eating with out worrying about scalding my face. (wish it was a little bit warmer though). 

I got the veal raviolis and shrimp ontop (as recommend by the server).

Shrimp was overcooked... :\, ravioli was just okay... I wasn't really blown away by it. Veal tasted dry inside...is that possible with ravioli? 

I tried the rest of my parties dishes and i wasn't blown away. Maybe my expectations have become too high of the fox restaurants.

I will chalk it up to a bad night at the restaurant. I'd give them a second try because all the other fox restaurants i have been to, i've enjoyed. 

But out of this experience it was a 3.  :\"
test_1523,What a mess. Been in line over an hour and there are still about 10 people in front of me. Should've stuck with the company I usually use....next counter or two over. Came here based on SW Airlines suggestion and email. Ugh
test_1524,The most amazing and helpful employees I have ever experienced at any store ever! I even got a little hand massage when trying their awesome lotion! I had a spa experience! They were soooooo nice and helpful at this store! I didn't want to leave! If I could leave more than 5 stars I would!
test_1525,"Delicious salads and made from scratch pizza.  Excellent wait staff.  Prices are reasonable.   Rather small menu, but quite adequate.   Good parking at this location.   Highly recommended."
test_1526,OMG! Once you go their for the first time you can't drive  past it without going in!!! Their French onion soup is amazing! The waitresses are kind and friendly! Totally Recommend!
test_1527,"Yes the bread is amazing. Their morning staff is awful.  Waited 25 minutes for an order of French toast,  had 2 people ask me about it,  only 1 helped.  Horrible service in the morning.  Breakfast food is ok, maybe their lunch is better.  Go at night,  the manager is really nice at that time."
test_1528,"If you are looking for something that is consistent, has great flavor, and isn't going to kill your wallet, this family owned and operated Mexican restaurant with a decidedly New Mexican style menu is a great place.
Tonight I had a beef burrito with beans and rice, with the burrito done enchilada style with a red sauce. The beef inside was fantastic, shredded with a nice flavor and wonderful seasoning.

Something completely underrated? The mixed drinks from the bar. This isn't a hipster craft cocktail bar, but their bar does what it should: they make great margaritas and the Mexican beer is ice cold and plentiful.

The staff is always friendly, management is always on the floor and I have never seen it dirty or tables and not cleaned immediately after people depart. 

Enjoy. It's not fancy, but it's yours and it's local."
test_1529,"After living here for over a year, our experience has been great. It's always fairly quiet and the units have been well maintained. The office staff is helpful, courteous & friendly. And with the new management company, they've started hosting resident parties. Just a nice gesture.  I think in 13 months the only work order we've ever submitted was for garbage disposal repair. And the maintenance guys were here within an hour. 

Not to mention the convenient location!  Seconds from the light rail, minutes from the airport, easy drive to Scottsdale.  

Dog park is certainly a plus when you need to run your pup quickly and I've noticed that doggie poo bags are now consistently available. 

We really love it here."
test_1530,"Visited the Packhouse for the first time and we had a great time. Food is Southern cuisine and our table ordered the shrimp and grits 10/10, Crab cakes 8/10, fried chicken 8/10 and stuffed peppers - a low score. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty in keeping our table well stocked and refreshed. Wine selection is good along with full bar. Atmosphere is rustic with a tin roof and rough cut wood tables.
The bar area is great for mingling and the TV's have the big game on.

I plan on coming back soon - a great time for all!"
test_1531,"Service was excellent once I got their attention!  Approximately 1:30 pm, but not busy at all. It took a bit of time for them to recognize that I was seated by the greeter, and that no one had waited on me. The food was served hot, I ordered breakfast menu items. The waitstaff was friendly and courteous and my waitress acknowledged that I did not have a lot of time to eat."
test_1532,"Sooooo good!!!!  the bolognese was on point, the drinks were delicious, the burger was cooked well and very flavorful...the staff was amazing and friendly!  Love this place!"
test_1533,"I've been going here for over 2 months. The Staff and Doctors are very nice and professional. The wait is always prompt, which I'm not used to with past Doctors offices. I recommend this place."
test_1534,"I came into this restaurant to use a gift card and the I am so glad I didn't have to pay. I was appalled by the soggy shrimp, tasteless fish, greasy baked potato and the slop on my girlfriend's plate was atrocious. Everything from the flavor to the appearance was just a jumbled mess of ersatz food. The biscuits may be the only redeeming quality (kind of like the fries at McDonald's), however they are hardly compelling enough to return."
test_1535,"Went here on Sunday and it was really good. Sushi was amazing, and for the AYCE price i think it's a good deal on sushi. Sevice took a bit but other than that it was a nice place, and I even got seated pretty much instantly."
test_1536,"Mirage nails is the first nail salon I ever went to & since then have been so happy with their work ! I recently tried new salons to get a ""cheaper"" bill, it was not worth it ! Now that I have also had a little more insight and experience; I see that mirage nails prices are very fair and totally worth it! The staff is amazing and so friendly, they are always working hard to get the look that you want ! For as long as I'm here in chandler, Az, I'll be coming to mirage for all my nail appointments"
test_1537,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. There was no wait and we were seated quickly. The waitress was a polite young lady who gave us time to look over the menu. I've been here before and I love their tofu pho. It's hard to find but I like that Doan's gives you the option between plain tofu and fried tofu.

My partner ordered the veggie fried rice, and we had crispy spring rolls to split as an appetizer.

My pho was very good. I ordered the regular size portion. Good amount of noodles, enough tofu for my taste, and some extra green onions, mushrooms, and carrots. I added most of the toppings that they gave. 

Loved the portion sizes, loved the flavor, my partner loved his rice, and we will definitely be back to check out more of their vegetarian section!"
test_1538,"Lemme tell you something real quick about  this spot. No word of a lie, first of all, it's crazy hype because it came from some other place. But truth be told it's not that sick. I'd give it a solid 8/10 but its definitely something you'd randomly crave in the midst of Netflix N Chill.

Food and Drink combo is getting a bit overpriced, like real talk. This restaurant is in Markham, you tryna tell me that a bowl of noodle soup should be over $10? SMDH. I still eat with this restaurant styll.

Stuff to get:
- Peanut Spicy Soup
- Extra Hot Sauce
- Cold Green Milk Tea"
test_1539,"Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad from the drive through. One dressing packet, which isn't really enough for a full size salad, should be one for a half size and two for full. More importantly, no croutons! Thanks for nothing except taking my money. Is this job really that hard?"
test_1540,"Be prepared to wait a few minutes. This is a small location with limited space. There is also very limited space to wait. 

The soup dumplings, jellyfish salad and tofu appetizers were good. Everything else we got was fine. It was fun to watch them hand make the items though the window. Other than to get soup dumplings I don't think I'd return."
test_1541,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  It is not easy to find authentic Shanghai soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) that aren't too thick/doughy/stuck together and Everyday Noodles hits the mark.  If they would expand to Cincinnati I would be a happy camper and probably visit weekly for the xiaolongbao alone.   

I was a little less impressed with some of the other menu offerings: seaweed wasn't good, the boba milk tea tasted off (both the milk and the tea were off) and the soup I tried was not memorable.  But that is easily forgiven - if you come here for the soup dumplings you will not be disappointed!"
test_1542,"It's a really cute place with overpriced food, great service, and live music. 

Located right in the heart of Old Montreal, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot right when they opened on a Friday. We were seated in their covered terrace while the band was setting up. Our server was attentive, kind, and helped us decide what to get.

The drinks were surprisingly strong, especially for noon on a Friday. My Moscow Mule was nice and strong and my girlfriend really enjoyed her smoothie. We ended up sharing the baked goat cheese and the local cheese plate. The goat cheese was wrapped in a flaky pastry and served over a pesto sauce and a red pepper sauce. Really good. The cheese was all local and pretty decent, but it could have been bigger for the price.

You come here for the experience, not really for the food. All in all, a really fun place!"
test_1543,I'll have to say as a first time visit here this place was great the food was good and the service from the staff was great the options of games to play on a driving range were awesome definitely not a boring night will definitely go again
test_1544,"Stopped in to load up on carbs before the Arizona Rock n Roll Marathon since there was a lucrative Groupon available. From the get-go service was a highlight. The owner, Patricia, was very attentive and accommodating since we sat outside and one of the heaters wasn't working. It didn't stop there, though. She and her staff were great, even the in-training waiter that served us. The baked ziti, spaghetti with meatballs, slice of pizza, jalape√±o poppers, and angel bites were all perfect for us. The restaurant claims to make everything in-house and the taste of it made it hard to deny. Great local Phoenix spot!"
test_1545,Two stars is kind when you watch the pudgy manager lady (Renee?)roll her eyes about you but not talk to you or acknowledge you in any fashion. I asked the cashier to order me a replacement Mirror since mine arrived cracked online. She couldn't get the computer to pull up the order so she asked Renee for help which consisted of three phone calls (who the heck was she calling?!?) and then finally sent me away. Worst customer service ever. She treated me like I broke the mirror on purpose!
test_1546,"Choolaaaaahhhhh is my jam. Basically think of it as the Chipotle of Indian food, except better. The chickpea masala is a go to move here as well as the yellow lentil soup."
test_1547,"Not worth the price.  Peel and eat shrimp, snow crab legs that you have to crack yourself.  No King Crab, no Lobster.  I don't know why people think this is a good deal for what they charge.  For the record I wouldn't eat here again if it was half the price.  You can go to a much better buffet in town for the same money and get a lot more food and much better quality."
test_1548,I had purchases a Relax & Renew New client Introductory Package from this company to see if I like there massages. I had called many times to schedule an apt and was told they did not have any openings for weeks at a time. I called again to make an appointment and was told they would not honor the certificate because it had expired 6 weeks ago. Why will they not honor something I already paid for? Not a good way to get new clients who had already paid for your services.
test_1549,"This is what I have considered my secret spot for a while, mostly because it is the kind of restaurant you only enter accompanied by someone who knows the place! It is very difficult to find it if you can't read Chinese (you definitely know there is something up there as there is a sign, but you have no way of knowing if it is a secret Chinese spy agency, Jackie Chan's lair or the best Chinese restaurant you can possibly find in Montreal) but once you do, you become a privileged member of the very special club of those who know (I would have italicized ""know"" if I could). Alright, last time I checked I think there was something written in English, but you could still be confused, and you do have to climb some stairs,  I understand that this involves some kind of commitment, you know, you must be sure there is something worth it up there before you undertake to climb said stairs. You wouldn't want to go through all that trouble for nothing, or worse, have to climb down on an empty stomach. 

More seriously, you get a very good meal for 8$ (a side of rice with three dishes of your choice) and this is as cheap as Chinese food can get, especially for that quality! The lady who usually takes your order is very polite and there is no waiting time as she will just load up your plate as you point at the dishes and I never had to wait in line!
They do not deliver but you can take it to-go and I would definitely recommend getting your meal from here and bringing it back home rather than ordering over-priced Chinese food for delivery, it is worth it! (So, you know, climb the stairs!)"
test_1550,Big disappointment! I ordered the premium bouquet and i got the bargain basement bouquet. If you are expecting it to look like the picture don't buy from this place. I ordered the Love and Laughter premium $79.95. It looked nothing like the picture. And when I complained by email they never even responded to me.
test_1551,Very tasty but way overpriced.  You will leave hungry unless you order several plates of food.
test_1552,"Why don't more people know about this place? Dijlah is amazing. 

We had the lamb shank and the Iraqi kebab (opted for fries instead of rice). The lamb was incredibly tender and had the perfect amount of fat. The generous amount of rice that came with it was fantastically seasoned. We thought the portion of meat was going to be larger, but the quality more than made up for it. The Iraqi kebab was also a great choice and was prepared perfectly. I really wanted the fries because I'm in love with fries and they looked good from the photos on Yelp. They did not disappoint. 

It was a spacious dining area with seats and colorful decor along the walls. There was something quite charming about the atmosphere. From the patterned pillows to the very visible ceiling plugs, we felt like we were eating in a friend's living room. (Even the bathroom felt very home-like.)

Boyfriend said this is the best food he's had in Pittsburgh. It was the best meal I've had since coming back after three months in NYC. Dijlah has replaced our go-to Middle Eastern restaurant. Cannot wait to be back!

test_1553,"A great neighbourhood health food store! Surprised to find GF things I can eat here like Live prepackaged salads and kimchi, as well as Nancy Greniers' fantastic vegan ch√®vre. 

I send in various people to shop for me and they report that either they were treated very kindly or that they were treated like a potential thief and did not feel very comfortable. 

Great find in the 'hood. Someone here has en eye for true quality instead of fake ""healthy"" food."
test_1554,"I love AYCE places, and this was a really cool one located in between Scarborough and Markham. My accompanying friend had a few favourites, which were also things I liked to eat when I went to Asian AYCE places. We went at lunchtime. The sirloin steak was AMAZING. My goodness. So were all the deep fried items, the sushi, and they had a curry dish that was not spicy but tasted and felt like actual indian curry, it was such a weird feeling. The decor was very nice, until you look up and realize the top is warehouse-like. Service is slow, but for such a large AYCE restaurant, it's understandable.  Sometimes my friend and I were waiting for a long time for food, but luckily we are both chatterboxes and the wait time flew by. 

NOTE - The restaurant will charge you a tip, on top of the lunch AYCE price. Definately coming again to try more food."
test_1555,"Norm's is okay. I can't say that there's anything that stands out at this restaurant. 
It has a locals ambience. I've seen the owner walk around chatting and catching up with his returning customers, which is nice.
Norm's cafe offers quite a varied menu. There are Chinese (porridge) Hawaiian (loco mocos), Mexican, and American breakfast options. I have yet to try anything from the lunch menu. What got me in was the poster outside boasting that their eggs Benedict was the best. I got one with spinach and tomatoes and it was just meh. I barely remember eating it about a month ago. I do remember the sauce being bland. Wouldn't get it again. Their super breakfast is a super deal- comes with a lot of food. 
I've also had the grilled veggie hash, which was loaded with eggplant, onion, green onion, & potatoes. But not seasoned well at all. I drowned it in hot sauce and ketchup. My boyfriend's loco moco was just that. Rice, patty, & brown gravy. Nothing amazing. 

Everything considered, it's not a bad restaurant. It's just not preferred on my list. Portions are right & gets the job done by filling you up. Locals seem to frequent the place, so they must be doing something right!"
test_1556,A little on the pricy side especially for drinks. But the rooftop summer live shows are tops!
test_1557,"Mixed feelings about this place. We ordered a recliner about 10 or so years ago. It still works perfectly well and has really held up - no sagging, all mechanicals working properly. I gave it to my children when they moved out as I want a power recliner and that one had the bar on the side. They had a 30% off power and leather sale recently. Since the chair I wanted now was both power and leather, I went in to see if I could get what I wanted. The power chairs with the different motors for adjusting lumbar and head as well as legs and back are wonderful and this is the only place I know that has those options. But you will pay dearly for that comfort. The chair I ended up with was over $2000, tax and delivery included, even with the 30% off sale! I'm waiting for it to be delivered because it is semi-custom but I anticipate it being comfortable. However, the reasons for the lesser star rating is some of their wacky policies. Since this is a chair, we were going to save money ($70) by picking it up in my husband's truck. If you go that route, they will still charge you $39 to have it delivered to the store. What? Why? That is ridiculous. When you discuss (argue) these silly policies, they pretty much just shrug their shoulders and say ""company policy"" as if they have absolutely no control - and maybe they don't. Because they are corporate owned now (changed over two years ago according to store manager), they will not (cannot?) negotiate costs for anything. I asked if they had a warehouse where we could pick it up for free. No. Also, even if I paid the $39 and picked it up myself, I'd have to sign off on it (after inspecting it in the store). If I bring it home and put it together myself and then have a problem, I'm out of luck since I signed off that it was perfectly fine. Um no, not doing that so I paid the money for delivery. Very bad business practice and nothing to be done about it!  The next reason for the lower star rating is their policy for custom orders. Their pricing policies are really arcane! I really wanted a bright red leather for my new chair and they offered it in a lower grade leather than the standard one on the chair I ordered. But even though it was a lower grade leather, it wasn't an included leather option for this chair so the custom price was $500 more for a lesser quality leather. Huh? They really make it almost impossible to make your order custom without paying through the nose (which I'm already doing - $2000 for a CHAIR?)!  Apparently there's a set of fabrics/leathers for each model chair that you can choose as semi-custom for that chair without changing the price much. But go outside that standard set and you're going to pay A LOT for the privilege. I decided on the wine colored red that didn't cost me any more money. Definitely NOT what I wanted but acceptable. The staff was friendly. Because they don't work on commission, they don't hassle you but they also aren't running to meet you at the door to help you out. Overall, I'm hoping I'll be happy with this purchase because I'll be able to make adjustments to my chair to make it most comfortable for me but I'm paying a lot for that and not getting everything that I wanted. Hence my mixed feelings and 3 stars instead of 5."
test_1558,"We are leaving the practice. My 5 year old was showing signs of a bladder infection so I called to get her in, it was 1pm. They told me there was no one I could see until the following morning. I was leaving town and told them this which they just suggested going to urgent care. We did and she did in fact have an infection. It took 5 min at an urgent care and a $300 bill later. I called and spoke with the assistant practice manager and she said I should have asked to speak to her the three times I called to see if they could get me in prior to bringing my daughter to urgent care. She would have had someone see her- really? It takes no time to run urine. I'm going to another group that can see patients when they need to be seen."
test_1559,"This place is great, only problem I had was deciding what yo eat.  You walk in and the smell of great food over comes you.  Staff was very helpful and the food was very good and lots to choose from, everyone in our party was please with their lunch."
test_1560,"We went here to watch the Vegas Knights game, so we were there for a few hours. We sat outside which was nice, we got to see the pregame festivities coming by. Our server was pretty terrible. Anytime we needed anything we would have to flag her down. She would come out to bring food to one table & not check on any of her other tables. We started with a few small items, then we ordered a pizza. We wanted black olives on it, but we were told that they do not have them, no worries. When the pizza was brought out by someone other than our server, we asked him for Parmesan & red pepper, he seemed a little bothered by that & replied ""give me a minute"". Well after 10 minutes I just ate the pizza without it. When I saw him walk by later I said ""you never brought us our Parmesan & red pepper flakes"".  His reply was ""oh I told you're server to bring them to you"" & he turned around. No apology, no accepting any sort of responsibility, nothing. I've never had a server respond to me in that manner. I will never be back & would definitely not recommend anyone to go here. Oh also, one of the other problems is there is only ONE men's & ONE women's single stall bathroom for the whole restaurant!!! Ridiculous, I don't even see how that is legal!"
test_1561,I went back in today. The health rating was up to an A and everything looked a lot better. I had the pastrami melt. It was really good. Their pastrami is top notch.
test_1562,"I made a yelp account just so I could write this review, that's how rude the staff is here! The first time I came here I thought maybe it was just a one time thing. But they are consistently, unfailingly, disrespectful. I will never in my life come back here again."
test_1563,"BEST MEAL IN PHOENIX AREA-
Okay, background to qualify me to say this- I was raised in a family with a parent who is a Food & Beverage Director at very prestigious hotels all over the World. I grew up on 5 star restaurant food and basically lived in hotels. I moved out to the Phoenix area about ten years ago and eat out all the time. I have had meals for two that have cost $300 that didn't taste as life changing as the food at the Centurion.
A work friend has been bragging about this place for years now and for years I thought he was just exaggerating. Nope- wow- our taste buds were dancing with joy!
So this place has a pretty good beverage selection ;-) and the food they serve are Tapas (small plates). I believe there may be certain dishes you can order in an entree size but you'd have to check with them.
Our group sampled a few rounds of different beverages. They are very knowledgeable about their beer and wine choices and will even offer small tastes to pair with your tapas. Their menu is completely seasonal as they use fresh ingredients. We sat in the room with the kitchen, which is extremely small and you would never in a million years expect the quality and flavor in the dishes to come out of that kitchen. 
We ordered many items between two couples, here is what my Husband and I ordered: 
-Risotto of the Day (Pumpkin with a light cheese) x2- and then again at the end of the meal- my husband wanted more too, it was so amazing. Light and creamy and topped off with some very lightly sea salted pieces of delicate pumpkin. Wowza- incredible!
-Papas Bravas - ""Potatoes Pan Fried in A Spicy Pimento Sauce, Finished w/ Chive and Garlic Cr√®me Fraiche"". Most delicious and flavorful potato dish I have ever tasted. It was impressive that the outside had this nice crispiness to it but the inside was so fluffy.
-Chef Eric's Bolognese - ""Over House-made Fettuccini"" - Super flavorful and delicious! 
-Stuffed Mushrooms - ""Stuffed with Pesto Risotto and Wrapped in Prosciutto w/ Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce"" - OMG- Wow, flavor explosion. Cannot stress enough how delicious these are and you will love them regardless of if you like mushrooms. 
-Baked Brie - ""Brie and Raspberry Preserves Baked Fresh to Order -  Inside of Puff Pastry"" - Just melts in your mouth- yummy yummy!
-Pancetta Wrapped Gnocchi - ""With an Aged Cheddar Sauce & Harissa Toast Points"" - Okay, I honestly loved every single item we ordered, but I imagine these flavors in my dreams. This is probably the MOST DELICIOUS thing I have EVER eaten in my life. Wowza- no joke, get here, order this, make your food dreams come true!

We also had two desserts- one light and fluffy like a giant macaroon and the other was their famous chocolate siracha cake. Both delicious! 

Seriously cannot wait to go here again and take everyone I know there for a piece of heaven. :-)"
test_1564,"Last year I did two trips with Hit the Road - one from Calgary to Richmond Hill via Canada and the other from Ottawa to Victoria (mostly via the US) driving over 8100 km in total. 

Hit the Road is a vehicle deliver service. I can't speak for the aspect of getting a vehicle delivered, because I've only used Hit the Road as a driver. As a driver you go to their website and find a route that interests you. The routes will vary from where the start to where they go to, and when they occur. You get your paperwork in order (valid driver's licence, driver's abstract, etc are just some of the things you'll need for a trip) and apply for a route. You'll be given a contract to sign before you can drive a vehicle. Driver's are required to pay a deposit, but this is an insurance for both you and the vehicle owner. As long as you deliver the vehicle to the destination on time and in good condition then you're deposit will be returned to you (although the returning portion takes time). Driver's will also be given some reimbursement for gas costs - it likely won't cover everything, but it helps.

I chose to drive with Hit the Road because I had to go to Toronto, and because I love road trips and wanted to see more of Canada (and later the US). My first trip to (Calgary to Toronto) went off without any issues. It is a long drive particularly by yourself. You can have another driver with you, but you would need to discuss this with Hit the Road first. Hit the Road gives drivers plenty of time to get from point A to point B. They don't want their drivers on the road in the evening or for driving long periods of time, so the longest days I had on the road were about 8 hours. Driver's are also warned not to speed, obey traffic laws, etc. Basically Hit the Road wants you to deliver the vehicle in good condition, but they want to make sure your doing this safely and lawfully. 

On my 2nd trip from Ottawa to Victoria I hit a couple of small snags, but it wasn't anything that would deter me from using Hit the Road again in the future. Going from Ottawa to Victoria I had asked if it would be okay to drive through the US (via Sault Ste. Marie) because it would save me time. I experienced a bit of a delay at the US border crossing and was pulled into secondary screening at customs. Normally, as I was later told by Hit the Road's owner, dropping off a vehicle from Canada to the US involves specific paperwork and forms, but because I wasn't dropping off a vehicle in the US, just delivering it to Canada going through the US, the Customs officers were a bit hesitant to let me through; it was a bit stressful. I think border officials were also a bit confused at whether or not I was working for Hit the Road. Again this isn't a job, and really with other costs of travel (lodging, food, etc) you definitely won't be earning any kind of livable way of doing this. Hit the Road is a way to travel cheaply, and see different parts of Canada (and the US depending on your route), but it isn't a way to make money.  

The second small snag happened in rural Michigan when a vehicle in front of me spit a rock up, and cracked part of the windshield. It was noticeable, but I still felt it was safe enough for me to continue driving (didn't affect my visibility). I made sure to pull over (when it was safe) and take a photo of the window. I also phoned the owner of Hit the Road to let him know what had happened. He made sure to find out if I was okay first and foremost, and contacted the vehicle owner to find out what should happen. The vehicle owner was very understanding, and didn't charge or ask me to pay out of pocket for the window repair. I can't guarantee everyone's experience will be like this if damage happens to the vehicle they are driving, but this is how it was for me. This is also why you pay a deposit, in case something happens then you are covered or can at least get in for a repair.

Hit the Road won't be for everyone. You need to have a good driving record, be reliable, and flexible. Both of my trips took about a week each, but I was able to see parts of my country and the US that I had never seen before. It is important to remember that Hit the Road doesn't offer return trips, so you'll need to find a way to get home or to wherever you're going to next yourself. I took the second trip (Ottawa to Victoria) trip because I hadn't booked a way to get home, and while Victoria isn't anywhere near where I live (Edmonton, Alberta) I was going in the right direction, and I still wasn't ready to stop traveling. If you only have a week or two of vacation time Hit the Road might not be for you, but if you have some flexibility with your job (or if you're retired) then Hit the Road is a great way to see North America."
test_1565,"My friend and I decided it was time to try this place out after we have gotten a recommendation from one of our friends.

We came here on a Friday night at around 1115pm. The place had about 3 people online. I asked for recommendations to the employee and she was very attentive and gave me a variety of options . 
Will definitely be coming back here soon! The pizza was perfect."
test_1566,"I'd come here for dinner before and had a great meal but closer to when it first opened. This time, I tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience.

 I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.

I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.

On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how ""When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion."" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.

I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu). That coupled with my original visit mean I'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if I just caught them on a bad day."
test_1567,"This is the third time I've come in, now, I've only had their breakfast here (which is my favorite meal of the day) and it has always been good! Their buttermilk muffins are to die for! This last time, the girls and I decided to try their mimosas. It was all of our first time trying and this is the only reason I took a star off! We each tried each other's drinks and mine was the worst - simply because our waitress poured too much of the champagne in my drink, it tasted sour and bubbly; my friend had a smoother and sweet finish! I'd suggest you have yourself do the honors. Asides from never wanting to order a mimosa again, everything was great :-)"
test_1568,"Great drink specials, the server was awesome, quality atmosphere.  Not all that busy but that made it easier to converse with our friends.  Good place to meet up with friends and have a relaxing evening."
test_1569,We are so sad to see Sabrina leave Orange County!!!  We have depended on her for the past 4 years petsitting our huge English Mastiff.  Sabrina has made our lives so much easier to travel with peace of mind knowing that Kali would be well taken care of and even giving up updates and pictures while we were gone.  Do not hesitate to use Sabrina - she is really as fabulous as everyone on this site says.  NO KIDDING!!!  And if she ever comes back to O.C. we will welcome her back with OPEN PAWS!!!

test_1573,Interesting place to say the least. Crowd was good and lively and the beer was priced fairly. They have a foozball table and a good selection of music.
test_1574,I love island style!! The owner is super nice and the food is great every time.
test_1575,"Ever since I started doing my eyebrows I only trusted one person with them but I moved out here to Vegas and I was too scared to do anything to them myself so I did my research and found pink cherry wax. I've never had anything waxed before so I was nervous, especially trusting someone new with them, but I AM IN LOVE with my brows. I guess everyone was right about Victoria, she knows exactly what she's doing and she did an amazing job. She is my new eyebrow lady forever!"
test_1576,My best friend and I went to Sole last Friday night. It was such a nice meal. Very taste. Fresh bread was nice. Bananna chessecake so yummy. Management was very nice.
test_1577,"We hired this company to help us move our belongings from our house into a freight truck in front of our house. The two guys wanted to show up almost 4 hours early, but got upset when we told them the truck hadn't arrived yet. When they arrived after the specified time and the truck was there, they were just grabbing bags that we had explained were going into our vehicles for the move that had clothes, medications, etc. and putting them into the freight truck. When we found out about it, they refused to move boxes they'd put in front of them to get the bags out. We found out that several of our things were damaged, scratched, and before they left, one of the movers was caught trying to steal one of my glass items when he was caught putting it into his truck. The other mover, Bobby, said that he himself was on parole and wasn't about to steal anything. However, when we unloaded at our new house, we found over $600 worth of tools stolen that had last been loaded onto the truck by those two movers and unloaded by me. 
During the last hour we paid them for, they were just hanging around outside and not doing anything to help us move the beds or anything else. They finally decided to leave without moving a queen mattress, a crib, a recliner, coffee tables, etc. I ended up calling Justin, the owner, about everything they hadn't done before they'd left. Justin told me that the movers complained of having to step all over things (those things being my children), and boxes being in the way, things all over the place, and how disorganized we were. WE WERE MOVING! I explained that there were many things that weren't even moved and closets that were still full of big things that needed to be loaded. On top of calling me a liar, he claimed that he was a military man and knew how to pack things up quickly. He's telling this to a retired Army soldier who's moved 5 times while in the military and 3 times as a civilian, always having a moving company's help. Justin requested pictures sent to his phone and promised to get back to us. I sent them. When I never heard back, I tried calling him again, I only got voicemail. To this day, I'm still waiting for that phone call.. 
Justin and his company are a joke and it is just another way to rip off unsuspecting people who need help in a time when their lives are chaotic. Way to go Justin! Your thug employees robbed us and left us to do what we paid you for. Well played."
test_1578,"I did not even stay at this hotel, but had the BEST customer service experience.

I was on my way to a dance function, in mid October. We pulled up the Sheraton and stood outside realizing we had gone to the wrong hotel. We were freezing, when a front desk receptionist came out to and ushered us inside. He then proceeded to sit with us and help us find the hotel we were actually suppose to be at. We all felt very safe and thankful we didn't have to be outside in the dark and cold!! I wish I could have gotten his name!"
test_1579,"I recently stayed here for a very busy convention.  The hotel was filled to capacity and there were a lot of immature younger kids running around.  The staff was phenomenal. The hotel's check in time is 4 pm.  We arrived at 8 am for the convention and the desk staff was courteous and got us in our room right away.

The room was nice and large and clean.  The bathroom was clean.  I always look for mold in showers at hotels and there were none.  Housekeeping did a great job, especially since the hotel was filled to capacity.  My only complaint about my visit was the bed.  Which a bed is why you stay in a hotel.  That is the only thing keeping it from a 5 star review.  The mattress felt cheap and had just a thin pad on them.  However the amenities in the room were great.  I will say that the walls are a bit thin.  I could hear people/dogs at times.

Breakfast was good.  It wasn't the best hotel breakfast, but definitely better than a lot of places.  Being included with the room was a plus.  There was good variety.

And again about the staff, everyone was so friendly. I walked into a bathroom that had been trashed by other less considerate con goers. The lady cleaning up was very nice and friendly to us (especially considering the situation).  I thanked her.

I pretty much stayed here in what would be a nightmare situation, and the hotel exceeded my expectations."
test_1580,Awesome place! Had a great time....got the ultimate VIP treatment by going through Brian Pfeiffer 1 (773) 459-8133. Highly recommend!
test_1581,"Cannot go wrong here. Outstanding steaks, wine and wait staff. The lobster mashed potatoes and mac n cheese are a must have. Portio.n size makes it great for sharing for those like me who cannot decide. 

Beautiful view of north side of Camelback. Mtn from outside dining. Cool bar. 

Only regrets are we have not made it for Sunday brunch yet but will and they are not 30 minutes closer."
test_1582,"Doctor did not thoroughly assess issue with foot. Did independent research and my symptoms match more with another issue than the one this doctor recommended. Doctor has lots of experience, however attitudes changed in his office once I questioned getting a boot for treatment. More in the business of quickly seeing patients as numbers rather than actually analyzing what the issue could be."
test_1583,"This rating is not just about arrowhead lexus but also about lexus in general.  This is my third Lexus and each subsequent ownership experience has been worse than before.  Do not get the wrong, the cars R great and wonderful but it is the service department that  is crooked and dishonest even on the best day.  Unfortunately the car needs to be taken in every 5000 miles because the display is covered by a large warning sign.  Initial oil change was $80 and then I certainly got a shock when the 35,000 mile service was $900.  I grudgingly paid for it even though I felt I was getting cheated with a lot of things that the car really did not need.  Next time I went for the oil change discharged $660.  The oil change itself is $130.  The filters are another $200.  I was so angry at this that I walked out of the dealership and went to sun Devil and had the same service for $75.  I have now sworn that I will never ever own a Lexus ever again.  They are nothing but a bunch of crooks in every Lexus dealership that I have dealt with, whether it is a Lexus ( now the Scottsdale Lexus) or arrowhead Lexus now."
test_1584,"Maybe I should come here at night, get a tee up on a top floor and be on a date but this just wasn't a great time for me. I don't like the fact you can't make a time reservation without money commitment. The hour plus wait to start playing just wasn't worth it. I did like their beer selection and their appetizers were decent (but nothing I would order again). We had the fried pickles, queso with guacamole chips, flatbreads (steak and buffalo) and ice cream cookie. The best app was the buffalo flatbread, the rest were anticlimactic. The service was good but I just felt bored with the golf concept. At the end of the day you are still golfing so if you don't love golfing (I actually do like it) this might not be a fun time for you. It reminded me of bowling where it's continual waiting and confusion on who's turn it is. Next time I think I will just sneak a 6 pack into the driving range and save myself the time and wait!"
test_1585,I know little to nothing about biking and was looking for something to use on the Rail Trails and around the neighborhood.  The girl that helped me was super knowledgeable and did not make me feel as though my questions were silly (I can assure you to a pro biker I'm sure they were!) I never felt pressured in the least and was given all the time I needed to test out my options.  The entire staff was friendly and super helpful.  I will definitely be returning when I need any repairs or tune ups in the future!  A+ for their customer service!
test_1586,"Come here for great Greek food!! Don't go anywhere else for lunch,  THIS is the place you want to go! The Greek salad with gyros, I would strongly recommend!!"
test_1587,"I usually love Ruths Chris, but this particular location was pretty ghetto.  It's in the center of a strip mall next to a Subway.  It's not what I expected.  The food was consistently good as always like all the other Ruths Chris locations I've been to."
test_1588,"Maybe my experience was colored by the many great Sam Woo restaurants in California, but this location is just average. 

My aunt and uncle were in Las Vegas with some guests from Taiwan, and we decided to have dinner in Chinatown. Instead of Yelping, he picked this plaza, and then as a group we picked Sam Woo because of the brand name.

It wasn't until I checked in after sitting down that I noticed the two-star overall rating, which honestly shocked me a bit. In the end, I don't think the food is so bad that the whole restaurant deserves only two stars, but I will agree that it is not quite up to par with most Cantonese restaurants.

The eating bowls, plates, and cups were plastic, not ceramic, and looked a little cheap to be honest (and were this strange light blue color). Even some of our dishes were served on similar plastic plates (at least serve on plates with a little design if you opt for plastic)! I was surprised that the presentation of the dishes was so lackluster, given the pride the people from this region of China usually have about their food.

As for the food itself, it was decent but a bit too salty and oily, even for Chinese food. The menu was extensive but it was lacking some of the more prestigious/premium dishes, and where were all the quality soups? We ordered a vegetable dish, a tofu dish, a beef dish, a BBQ plate, and soup to share (see photos/captions). 

The interior of the restaurant is still relatively nice looking, though not as sleek as some other Cantonese places. And while some others have mentioned poor service, I thought that the service during our meal was fairly attentive from both waiters to bussers (maybe it helps if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese).

This Sam Woo is not terrible by any means but I feel like it's not quite up to the well-established Cantonese restaurant standard, and there are a lot of options in Chinatown. Granted, I still have to try more places in Vegas Chinatown to get a baseline impression of food in this region, since my gold standard is still California restaurants and we are spoiled there.

P.S. I've come to the conclusion that pretty much all of my lower-rated reviews have been at places that I didn't Yelp beforehand. Lesson learned: trust Yelp! If a place has more than just a few reviews by regular Yelpers, there is reason to take stock.

P.P.S. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. The waiter explained when he brought us our check that gratuity was already included. I thought this was kind of strange since we were only a party of 5. It looks like they do take credit card now (in reference to some older Yelp reviews of this place), but they have pretty high minimums (e.g. $20) and several categories (see the paper taped to the register)."
test_1589,"Excellent food, price is amazing. Always great! We ordered the family size ginger beef, shanghai noodles in black bean sauce, spring rolls and salt and pepper squid. All delicious and price was under $40"
test_1590,"My sister-in-law brought me here for a spa pedi while we were vacationing with them in AZ. From the moment I walked in I knew I would have a good experience. The place is absolutely beautiful. I was almost overwhelmed because the massage chairs are super high tech and I have never used a super state of the art massage chair. My sis-in-law has been going here for years and has a good relationship with the owner Mimi. 

We had to wait about 20-30 mins to be seated which didn't bother me since we didn't have an appt and there were three of us. Yen did my toes, Heidi did my Niece's toes and Mimi did my sis-in-law's. At first I thought Heidi was rude but then I quickly figured out she has a dry/sarcastic sense of humor and soon we were all laughing together and enjoying ourselves.

All three ladies were fantastic and the prices here are very reasonable, only $21 fir a spa pedicure. I hope to come back here again when I visit my family."
test_1591,"it's pretty flimsy. 
Like they're trying to be something they're not and not doing a good job at it. 
It's a nail bar so u sit at an uncomfortable BAR STOOL and get your nails done like you're at a bar... ooooh I get it. lol 
the people are fine and the list of services offered are pretty standard. 
It is overpriced and I stopped going after being charged 15 dollars to REMOVE shellac that I got done there. 
Shouldn't it be on the house if I got it done there? or less than 15 bucks? 
get out of here."
test_1592,Order pepperoni pizza and it was delicious and wings as well ! Everything was an delivery service they were fast and food was hot an ready. Very decent pricing. Would definitely recommend other people and would likely order all the time.
test_1593,"A bit of a limited breakfast menu, but the food was outstanding. Steak and eggs was perfect and the waffles are deceptively filling. Staff was friendly and attentive. Manager was all over the place making sure everything was done well and that customers are satisfied. Would do again :)"
test_1594,First time trying this place and I will definitely be back. Anthony was so helpful! Cyo burrito was amazing and the chicken teriyaki bowl was juicy and delicious! I'll become a regular really soon!
test_1595,"Pretty good shaved ice and i like the fact that its locatrd in the Northeast. I usually go with my younger siblings. They enjoy the BHM, which has once cream and condensed milk. We've been probably 6 times, enough to fill up two punch cards. I have tried the shaved ice, both regular and sugar-free and the coffee drinks. My advice, skip the coffee drinks and the sugar-free options. The coffee just isn't as good as something good you'd get at a coffee shop. It tastes watered down and lacks flavor. The sugar-free option are just disgusting. I actually threw it out. My advice would be to just get a smaller version of full flavor options and go light on the syrup. 

The ice is a bit pricey at around $4 or $5 with the bells and whistles, but it's still a nice treat."
test_1596,"Was here NYE, I wouldn't say it was perfect but heck they have only been open a month. The staff was over the top nice and attentive. The 4 course NYE menu was slow to the table but I was with an amazing lady and the food was great and the way it was presented was very artistic. No real complaints."
test_1597,"Served up some chili cheese dog for my lunch today. It was fresh, flavorful. The bun was nicely toasted and warm. The dog was plump juicy and had great 100% all beef flavor with no fillers. I enjoyed it and will be back. The service was great and the employees were nice, friendly and attentive. I did not try the fries or anything else. I have to come back now....lol."
test_1598,Suuuuuper disappointing! I thought I give this place a try and not listen to the reviews. Boy was I wrong! Prices are way to expensive and portions are super small. Guys come on! I'm going to have to stick with China go go.
test_1599,This was the worst food i ever had. They messed up our order when they delivered it. So we had to call and I brought the rest of the food. My daughter got sick a few hours  later and I believe she got food poisoning. So my review on this is do not eat here
test_1600,"There was briefly another, different mom-n-pop Mexican joint in this spot that I liked and was sad to see close down. So when it re-opened as El Burrito Loco I had to check it out and see if my dream of a legit Mexican joint close to home would once again come true. I got a tamale platter with a couple of chicken tamales, mole sauce, rice & beans. It was good. 

So I'd say, generally pretty legit Mexican food with plenty of menu items to choose from. I think it's run by a family--mom working the register and running food out from the kitchen, and her two sons cooking. At least I think so since the counter lady said ""mi hijo"" (""my son"") to one of the guys in the kitchen. 

So yeah, go support my neighborhood mom-n-pop (mom-n-sons?) Mexican joint!"
test_1601,"The food at Giuseppe's had always been good. In 2011, you would even put up with their terrible non-existent service to eat their pizzas.

Lately though I read that service had improved. And after checking them out again, it really has improved! Giuseppe's now has tasty food in concert with great service. 

I look forward to going back soon."
test_1602,"Two words, bruschetta board! My gawd was it good! I've heard a lot of good things about Postinos's from my AZ peeps and am so glad I finally made it in. They are definitely a wine and tapas place (limited menu) but if you're trying to keep your girlish figure you won't mind. We stopped in with a group of 4 on a Saturday night after top golf (745ish), so needless to say attire is casual. It was pretty crowded, no room at the bar, but were able to secure a table inside within 15 minutes. Now back to that bruschetta board... you are able to pick 4 different concoctions from a list of 12 and boy did we do a good job. We did the brie apple and fig, the burratta arugula and bacon, prosciutto mascarpone and jam and the trusty caprese rounded out our picks. Each piece cut into 4 so it was a perfect appetizer for our crew. Bottles of wine a priced well; (we did a decent Pinot for mid $20's) as well as their by the glass and beer selection. My husband and I shared the tuna and a soup and were super satisfied. This will definitely be in the Scottdale rotation moving forward."
test_1603,"First a complaint about Hollywood Gelato: I don't live closer.

As a big fan of frozen treats, Hollywood Gelato is a place I make special trips to visit. I'm a big fan of all the flavours and amount of choice. Staff are happy to let you try and handful of samples I think because they understand it's not every day you've had a snickers gelato and you want to make sure you're making the right choice.

Amount of gelato for the price here is fair and while they have other products on display, I've never bought one. If you're looking for baked goods on Bayview, there are better choices.

There are lots of sizes and ways to get your gelato at Hollywood Gelato. From small in a cup or waffle through a large take-home container. It's nice because you can get the amount of gelato you want without having to debate in your head if you should get the small and want more or get the medium and have too much.

The layout of Hollywood Gelato sucks. The gelato is at the front of the store but you have to walk by the crowd huddled around the display case to pay first. This process is actually not a bad idea but you have to go by a (usually) big crowd only to work your way back again. Staff do their best to keep the line moving, however, and I don't mind paying first before I get the product as it keeps my hands free to get my wallet.

There's also very little seating room in the restaurant and the patio is often busy. Even if it's not busy the metal chairs they have aren't that comfortable. 

When we go for Hollywood Gelato we usually plan to take it with us.

Pros: lots of awesome flavours of delicious gelato at a reasonable price and friendly staff

Cons: the process to get it means squeezing by people and don't plan on staying."
test_1604,"If I could pick zero stars I would ! This place is full of cheap clothes that tear on the first wash & their employees are stuck up , useless people . I tried to return a shirt w all tags & the receipt & their manager said I couldn't ! She even tried calling me a liar . NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN"
test_1605,Lol this place is disgusting. There were many flies inside the restaurant and the whole place smelt like sewage. I couldn't help but notice the young lady who takes the orders picking her face and nose the entire time while just standing there. It wasn't busy when we ate there today so the employees had a lot of down time. They should've turned that down time into cleaning time but they preferred just to stand around. The tables were dirty the floor had old food all over the place but the smell instantly ruined your appetite. I can't imagine what the bathrooms were like. I didn't have enough courage to find out. Fries were hot but that's about the only positive thing I can put in this review. Do yourself a favor and eat at one of the many other places Scottsdale has to offer.
test_1606,"Mr. G's has some of the best pizza in town! We love the pepperoni pizza and the sausage pizza!! Whenever we do make it there, there is always a wait to get a table but it's worth the wait..! The wait for our food is also a little long just because there is a lot of people there too. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. but most of the time we order out so enjoy!"
test_1607,"Surrender = Encore Beach Club!!!

I came here earlier in the day for EBC and couldn't put two and two together so my girls and I arrived dressed to the 9's expecting a club atmosphere like XS. Don't make the same mistakes we did!! It's much more casual as you can still wear your bathing suit into the pool!

The water by the pool gets very wet and slick (more so than other pools) so be careful!!

There is also a water fountain available, by the far end of the little casino/bar area. Find a plastic cup and keep hydrated!"
test_1608,"In a day where customer service seems to be nonexistent, this place is very refreshing. I started coming for waxing, which were amazing and fast and perfect. I  Then noticed that they started doing lashes. I had only gotten lashes previously one time, and they fell out every five seconds. I started getting them there, and they are amazing. I don't even realize I have them. I see Andrea and she's the best there is. She actually cares about the health of your real lashes also. I highly recommend this place for waxes and lashes, I wish I could give them more stars. Also the owner is amazing."
test_1609,First time I went there had a great experience. The owner did my nails and did a great job. Went back again had a terrible time my nails look awful they charge you to take the nails off that they originally put on they charge you for a new set on top of that charge and they charge you for design being a glitter overcoat. Never going back
test_1610,"I absolutely love winking lizard but this is the last time I will let the staff at this location make me feel uncomfortable.

Not only did the hostess bombard us, almost beg us, to sit at a table and not the bar so the servers could make money....but with less than 5 minutes of the game left all of the wait staff screamed at us to get out. Saying ""you have two minutes and then we're taking your drinks."" 

Very disappointed and upset almost embarrassed about this evening. Will be a very long time before we return....lost a few loyal customers tonight."
test_1611,"You are going to have a great meal here, great ambiance, over the top service and the Martini's?   Best you'll ever have.   Very pricey."
test_1612,"Someone please explain what I would have done before the advent of the smart phone and Yelp?  Eating a ton of terrible buffets in Vegas, that's what.  We came here after a friend suggested a buffet at Terrible's and my boyfriend and I were not in the mood for ANOTHER buffet.  After about 3 minutes of scouring the internet, we found this place.  Score.

I was a little worried at first because of the hole-in-the-wall look on the outside with reflective windows.  I thought it was closed at first but I was dead wrong.  I walked in there was wall to wall Asians everywhere.  Good sign.

I had the Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bop and my boyfriend had the Meat Combo over rice.  It was a great change up from what we normally do in Vegas.  If you have a car, it's just outside the strip and easily accessible."
test_1613,"We sat and wandered for 30 minutes and not a single one of the 4 or 5 sales people even acknowledged us.  Even a simple I'll be right with you would have kept us there.  We were ready to buy.  Their loss for sure.
We told the lady at the front as we walked out and all she could do was say, we'll be right with you.  Where was that 30 minutes ago."
test_1614,Had a great low-carb carnitas bowl from the Wandering Donkey food truck at the Queen Creek Olive mill today. They were very flexible filling my order. Thanks!
test_1615,"My husband and I came here last weekend for a Yelp Event and we can't stop thinking about their wings and fries! Upon entering, we were greeted and welcomed right away. The owners explained their menu and the different flavors they have for the wings. We ended up ordering the Fingers and Wings combo. With this combo, we were able to choose 3 different flavors. This combo also came with fries, toast, and a drink. All for $11.99! Definitely one of the best deals I've seen.

Between my husband and I, we got the flavors: mild, bbq, lemon pepper, teriyaki, and garlic parmesan. My favorite was the mild, teriyaki, and lemon pepper. They were so good, I couldn't just pick one. Their wings were awesome. I was a little hesitant ordering the tenders at first because I'm not a huge fan of them. Boy am I glad I ordered them! These tenders were bigger than your average tender. They were also still crispy even with the mild flavoring I ordered it with. Honestly, I ended up loving the tenders more! They were breaded just right! Most places have too much breading and too much sauce. Not Wing Time! Their fries were also one of the best that I have had. They were sooo good! Man, I hope they open another location in Summerlin."
test_1616,The staff here made my experiences very pleasant. I didn't know what to expect from the first visit.  Chico loved it and the staff love him.  I also referred my brother to take his dog.  She also did great so our dogs definitely enjoy their visits.  Thanks again Avondale staff
test_1617,These are the best people I will always use them they follow up follow through and a very thorough I had a difficult situation with a roommate I known for 20 years he tried to stay and stay and stay and they make sure it was over there great use them
test_1618,"One of my fav buffets in Charlotte. The Vietnamese rolls and Chicken/Broccoli are the best! 

Ambiance: Nice and Cozy, albeit a lil' dim. Booth and Table seating availability.

Customer service: Some of the waitresses have language barriers, but they do their best to accommodate you, even if that means bringing over the owner.

Food: Consistently hot, fresh and tasty."
test_1619,This was. The better place and then they got comfortable. And it's the run of the mill chilis 2 orders now completely incorrect go 5 min down the road it gets better
test_1620,"I absolutely love this place on all points. I went to Body English in the middle of Vegas' dead season (end of Fall/start of Winter) and it was still the best place to be. 

-There are many attractive people there so it's a great place to people watch. 
-They make strong drinks, so it's a great place to get drunk. 
-They have an amazing venue where you enter on an upper floor and walk up to a hopping dancefloor which you get to by walking down a wide grand stair so it's just a great place to be. 
-and last but absolutely not least, they have the best DJ i have seen in a very long time. Classics are updated and mixed in with new jams seamlessly and the DJ certainly knows how to keep the vibe up with the right music selection and sequence.

I highly recommend checking out Body English the next time you go to Vegas. I went there after a crazy/no-sleep/work conference week and still had a great time."
test_1621,"I was really happy with this newly opened cafe, and can easily get over the few flaws that I found.
I had the combo which includes sandwich, soup, and salad for $8.79
I added the pomegranate coconut water green tea .
There are 13 sandwiches to choose from , 12 salads and 10 soups . You can also add deserts if you choose and they also look delish. 
Expect a large lunch time crowd here .
Here are the few drawbacks I encountered during my visit . At the time of this writing (April 2016) the cafe is newly opened. There seemed to be some minor confusion between the employees trying to match sandwiches to salads and soups for different orders. With time , this problem will fix itself .
The other drawback was a poor design of the cafe. Aparantly they don't have a back service entry door for deliveries. That means that the daily (because they use fresh ingredients) come through the same small door which customers are using . Awkward to hold up foot traffic for a pallet jack full of deliveries. Even more akward is they use this same customer entry door to wheel out the trash bins (yuck).
Aside from those two drawbacks ... I really enjoyed the food and will DEFINATELY come here again and again ."
test_1622,"Burgers are average and overpriced. I had high hopes for this place. It's cute on the inside and fun to sit on the patio in the summer. I've been here a couple times hoping to be wow'd by a burger, but I just wasn't impressed."
test_1623,"I really like this place.  It is kid friendly during the day, and great for happy hour or late night drinks/eats with your friends.  

The menu, while not huge, is really well planned out. 

The staff is great, there are fun games to play, and good music is on all the time.

HIGHLY recommend!"
test_1624,"I'm a new addition to the staff and yesterday my guest couldn't make it into the salon so the amazing Chantelle gave me a complete makeover! I was ready to ditch my purple hairdo for something that speaks elegant and mature hairstylist! And this girl gave me such a beautiful color, cut, and sent me over to have my makeup done! The whole time she was complimenting me and made me feel awesome! She's great at what she does and I love my new beautiful brown color and love how she cut my bangs! She is so sweet and and keeps a great conversation."
test_1625,"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. 

Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area."
test_1626,"I have been going here since they opened and everyone who works there is great and its always nice to talk to everyone both the employees and customers. The coffee and food are great, I have had coffee all over North America and this definitely ranks high for me."
test_1627,"Tried to buy a wedding gift. 2 people at the register, which by the way is unusual to find a soul, clueless. They had no idea what was in the store. They also have quit wrapping gifts. TJ Maxx here I come. Why bother with parking and high prices when you get no service???"
test_1628,"Server not intuitive but friendly and courteous.   Table side guacamole was blah, no flavor.   My son did not like the chicjen tenders on the kids menu.  I think the batter was the same as you would use on fush sticjs.  We added more jalapeno and it didn't help.  My salmon was dry snd overly lemon flavored.   Watermelon Cooler was good."
test_1629,"Well, I was a fan until I came to fill my dogs prescription here. I dropped it off during a busy time and they said one hour to fill. I come back and they say they didn't fill it because of how much it cost. They wanted to make sure I was ok with the high price. Umm...how about call me or something? Too bad. Still get photos here but no longer fill prescriptions"
test_1630,"Crush vaulted to one of our favorite Vegas restaurants, especially on the strip. Had the ricotta gnocchi with braised beef, and my fianc√© had the date, artichoke, and jalape√±o pizza. Both were outstanding. French onion soup was solid as well."
test_1631,"Hands down the best Chicken & Waffles I have EVER had ! 

They know exactly what they're doing. My boyfriend and I had this dish 2 days in a row because they were so good and we were craving ! 

We also shared a berry fruit smoothie that was good but do not recommend adding any energy/protein to it. powder they used didn't mix well and was chunky. 

Great place ! Looking forward to returning and getting another order !"
test_1632,"HD quoted me a discounted rate for 10 hours of service, but when I checked my credit card statement I saw that he charged me full price. When I called him he said that my company wasn't giving him enough business, so he charged me full price. (I had used his service for 2 trips totaling nearly 20 hrs of service in two months!)

Congratulations Starr Limousine, you took my money but you lost my business."
test_1633,"Finally found a decent take-out Chinese restaurant in Charlotte! Trusted Yelp on this one, and wasn't let down. Ordered the house lo mein and it's a huge portion with a good mix of noodles, meat, and fresh cooked (not canned & slimy) veggies. Also ordered the General's Chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was very pleasant and tasted homemade with a mixture of honey & spice. We'll be back! :)"
test_1634,"I don't know many people who come to the Vegas Strip to watch a movie but this is a good place to beat the heat, kill some time, and maybe take the kiddies if they've run out of family friendly things to do on the Strip.

The UA Showcase Cinemas are located right around the corner from Coke World and tickets are available for purchase at a kiosk next to M&M World. The theater isn't anything special but it has A/C on full blast and the seats are somewhat comfy with plenty of leg room.

This theater also offers $7.50 matinees which for me turned out to be a convenient 3 PM matinee. Score! I don't know any other place in the country that offers first run movies that cheap. I spent my last day in Vegas watching Oceans 13 (the perfect Vegas movie to end a Vegas trip). It was entertaining and yes Brad is still munching in this film."
test_1635,"The Assistant Manager was super nice and great customer service, will come again! The Shrimp avocado salad was delicious!"
test_1636,"Came with my family (wife,  8-month-old girl,  and mom)  on a Friday morning for some light eats and Turkish coffee.  The sesame bagel with salmon lox was one of the best ever,  and I enjoyed the ""mastic""  version of the Turkish coffee (supposed to have added resin on top?).  Very friendly staff,  relaxed atmosphere,  and a convenient location. Will definitely return."
test_1637,"I love what they've done with this place. The decor is sweet in this small space. They have Nessalla kombucha on tap and the most unique pies you've ever known. Get there early, though, as the lines can be long. 

Don't worry, your boring friends can still order ""normal"" pizza, but this is the place to branch out and try new flavors, like Nami Moon Farms red harissa chicken, spruce goad salami, za'atar, tzatziki sauce and oyster mushrooms or Ssamjang marinated Acadian red fish and shrimp, smoked Gouda, scallions, micro shingiku (chrysanthemum), basil and tobiko. Whaaat?? Seriously, I don't know how they think of these combinations, but they have something different every night, and often have fun tacos too. They also make interesting desserts. Last night's offering was rosemary shortbread, earl grey buttercream with orange curd. I'm not sure what this is, but I need more of it in my life (and my belly).

They post their daily pies on Facebook, but you don't even need to read that to decide to stop in. Walk in, say you want the special and go with it!"
test_1638,"This is for the Las Vegas location but the quality of the trainer can apply to any of their locations.

For one thing the projector bulb was so dim we had to make the room pitch dark to see the screen.

If Im paying you $4000 to see a PowerPoint please have the respect to put a projector in with a working bulb! After complaints the lights were turned off and the bulb not replaced.

The instructor just read the Microsoft PowerPoint slides and it was obvious he did not have a command of the subject.

A few of us in the class just started asking him questions we knew the answers to and he never explicitly answered since he was not clear on the subject.

I could have taught the class!

Should have saved the $4K and bought the Microsoft books and read it myself.

Will never use these guys for our company again.

The positives: the food was good and the front desk guy was eager to make sure the right meals were given to the students.

Also the Desert Rose is a good place to stay. No gambling to distract but close enough to walk to the strip.
Rooms have full kitchen and the rooms are clean and updated."
test_1639,"It's in the mall people! A nice corporate chain restaurant that aims to offend no one.  Taken on that level, it's not bad.  Prices are fairly high and the food is fairly bland.  It's a place to stop in while getting some shopping done with the sweetie, not a place to take her to."
test_1640,"Any place that has belly dancers shake their stuff in your face during dinner gets high marks in my book.

I think the belly dancer(s) are there only on the weekends around 8, but you might want to check it out.

Loved the food.   Garlic naan, very good.  The kitchen is partially open which is nice because you can see them put the meat skewers out of the ovens (maybe they call them tandoors or something) anyways very good food.

I bit more upscale than most other Indian places in the valley."
test_1641,"There are lots of sushi burrito options in Las Vegas - only Soho gets it right.  This is their second outpost and arguably their best effort to date.  Not only can you get their now well known burritos, but you can also get poke bowls and teriyaki bowls!  My office is around the corner from here, and once a week I see people in the office easting food from Soho. We all love it and for good reason.  The food is fresh, tasty, well prepared, and affordable.  The people who work there are well trained, but more importantly they are hospitable and welcoming.  Try the 3 Amigos, Twin Dragon, Lion King, or Fire Cracker as rolls (with soy paper), or the Hilo, Lahaina, or North Shore Poke Bowls.  Grab a Ramune Strawberry Soda from Japan, sit back, and enjoy your meal!"
test_1642,"omg hyper bien! et pas trop cher non plus! sauf peut-√™tre le vin (qui √©tait espagnol bien et d√©licieux) ... mais apr√®s avoir v√©cu √† Paris, du vin partout ailleurs semble √™tre une arnaque!

vraiment, nous avons mang√© trop bien ici. le seul commentaire n√©gatif que j'ai est qu'ils nous ont pouss√© un peu pour commander des tapas beaucoup quand nous aurions pu faire avec moins. mais c'est normal pour les restaurants comme celui-ci je crois.

je recommanderais la crevette, le p√©toncle (un particulier), et la betterave. le r√¥ti de boeuf √©tait aussi tr√®s bon.
--------------------------------

omg sooooooo good ! and not too expensive either ! except for maybe the wine (which was spanish of course and delicious)... but after living in paris, wine anywhere else seems like a rip off ! 

really, we ate too well here. the only negative comment i have is that they pushed us a bit to order many tapas when we could have done with less. but that is normal for restaurants like this i believe.

i would recomend the shrimp, the scallop (a special), and the beetroot. the roast beef was also quite good."
test_1643,"The large bean and cheese burrito tasted like mush. It fell apart. I used to like this place but either it's gone downhill or I've developed a taste for better, like Quesada.

Plus, they won't give you a glass of water? Inexcusable."
test_1644,This place was Great and the food was delicious! I couldn't give 5 stars only because the service wasn't the best. Our waiter would walk by our table but rarely stopped to check on us. Outside of the off service everything else was great!! I had the keg burger and my mother enjoyed the prime rib and stuffed potato.
test_1645,"Hands down, the best Mexican food in the area for the price.  Flavorful chicken tacos and tostadas are my favorite, while my husband likes the carne asada burritos.  Not much on ambience, but the food is scrumptious."
test_1646,"All of the curry dishes are great. The barbecue rice is fantastic. Great staff. 
Fairly priced."
test_1647,"Nice happy hour selections for both cocktails and appetizers.  We tried the Brie & Bacon and Pesto Goat Cheese.  For our dinner selections, we tried the Mushroom melt and Pork Taco.  Everything we selected was prepared well.  For me the Pesto was really nice, not overly greasy like some pesto sauces can be.  The grilled cheese mushroom melt was very crispy/crunchy like one would expect for a grilled cheese sandwich.  Greens in the sandwich made for a nice freshness to sandwich.  The folk that served us were very nice, from greeting us at the door to our waitress."
test_1648,"Want good Food ? .... Eat Here 
Want great Service ....Go Here.  Ask to be seated in MELISSA section . 
Don't want to wait in Line ....wake up earlier =)  
The fast food line is just as long next door ."
test_1649,"Excellent wood fired pizza.  The service is great.  The food came quickly.  I couldn't recommend Pizzeria Blanco more if I tried.

Our order.

Mozzarella Appetizer - The mozzarella was soft and buttery.  It was great.  The peppers were very good too.  I would order it again.
Romaine Salad - It's a take on the Caesar Salad.  Excellent.  I would order it again.
Sonny Boy - My favorite of the 3 from the night.
Rosa - No sauce.  Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella.  And a pistachio topping.  It was very good.  The parmesan was sharp and had a great taste to it, but it was a little too much for me.  
Margherita - You can't go wrong here.  It was excellent and would definitely order it again."
test_1650,"Claims to be ""Charlotte's Most Unique Optical Boutique""  ok you have my attention... This place looks Nice!  Artistic Created Boutique instead of the typical Clinical ""Sterile"" looking Optical space!  Notice the Displays... Nice Touch!  

Eye Doc!  So your insurance will be footing part of the bill!  You can make an appointment to see her... 4 Eyes used to be the opposite of a compliment!

SALT

They Carry SALT... SALT Optics is a US (California) Company who has some Cool, I say Vintage, they say ""Timeless"", ""Modern, Honoring the Past""... SALT was what got me and kept me here so I'll be keeping an eye or two on SALT!

Dude!  They have Plenty of Great Looking less typical Eyewear for Men!  

Plenty of Styles for Ladies too!

They Carry a line which Donates a Pair of Glasses when you Buy a Pair!

Many Brands I have heard of and a few I have not!  Wish they had some they did not!

On the Second Floor (or Third) ""Upper Level"" on top of Which Wich!  Near ""Al's Pizza"""
test_1651,"I really do enjoy this place (: i will keep it pretty simple.
I always get some chicken shwarma-warmanarma whatever the kitchy name is, basically, i order grilled chicken, tomatoe, and lettuce in a pita. Always comes out warm & fresh. I find it very good, the chicken (for my taste) does not need fancy sauces. Although, since i nix many of the other items that it comes with, i do feel sliightly overcharged, however, i reaize i have 'customized' their menu. P:
the inside is clean, the servers are nice. I cannot complain, they do their job. I reccomend this place for a nice lunch, early dinner. We have frequented this place after weightlifting seshs."
test_1652,"FISHY FISH MARKET
If you're looking for fresh seafood, come no further than Fishy Fish Market in Charlotte, North Carolina!!! They have a wide assortment of fish that will blow your mind! This is also the ONLY place that I've ever seen that sells Sting Ray Wings!!! Totally wanna try next time! Prices are reasonable and they even cook it for you!"
test_1653,"Went based on reviews. It does look divey on the outside but sometimes the best restaurants do. Walked in and wasnt greeted, shuffled around the dining room for awhile looking for a booth to sit in not covered in crumbs. A lady working in the dining room called for a waitress to come out to me. She brought chips and salsa and was nice enough. I asked for a water which came out shortly. I ordered a beer and said I needed another minute with the menu. I guess there was my mistake. At least 10 minutes later my beer and server had never materialized again.  There were only 2 other people in the restaurant. I left a dollar for the chips and salsa i ate while waiting for my waitress to return and walked out. I passed a couple employees behind the counter talking happily. Shame, the cordon bleu shrimp and smoked marlin quesadillas sounded really damn good."
test_1654,It smelt super fresh and clean when we walked in and the associate took everyone's orders quickly with a smile and great attitude. There was a sense of urgency and care for each customer. Definitely my place to come!
test_1655,Great place to grab a bite to eat. Potato Scrambled delicious. I would recommend this please for sure.
test_1656,"What a disappointment!!! I love Guy's shows on food network and I expected a higher level of excellence from one of his restaurants.  I ordered the Vegas fries and after waiting for about 25 minutes they came out ice cold, soggy and with barely a hint of blue cheese crumbles.  My son had the mac n cheese burger which was pretty good but the fries he got had so much seasoning that they looked like the seasoning bottle was dropped on them and most were inedible. The sweet iced tea tasted like the swiss sweet tea you buy by the gallon for 2.99.  My husband had the wings which were ok but nothing special i can make much better at home but the celery they brought with them looked like the pcs that you throw away before chopping, the leafy yellow soft part, when he complained the waitress said they come pre-made.  That left us perplexed.   To top off the evening the waitress spilled blue cheese dressing all over my sons pants.   If you want good food, fresh brewed iced tea and good service go to Burgr from Gordon Ramsey"
test_1657,"I cannot say enough good things about this salon! Had TERRIBLE neon highlights done where the guy also bumped my base color to some yucky caramel color and Rudy fixed it! Just moved here from Chicago a month ago and needed a salon, saw their groupon and thought I would give it a try. So glad I did. Everyone was so friendly and my color as corrected with lowlights and highlights and he listened to EXACTLY what I wanted and then helped me with how to grow my angled chin length bob out. AMAZING."
test_1658,"If I could I would give no stars at all. Service was horrible, the lady wearing glasses was rude and unprofessional. The customer before me and after me were both complaining proving I wasn't the only one. I will not come back and don't recommend anyone on coming here. If you guys are craving McDonalds go to another one a few blocks away, you'll be glad you did."
test_1659,"Although you pay a pretty penny the work is worth it. It's art! We got Armando he was legit, professional as well as very knowledgeable the staff was very friendly. My husband and I are very happy with the work. Definitely going back for any future tattoos."
test_1660,Called ahead for a specific shoe item & was told they had it. We get there and same gentleman tells us the don't have it. WTF?
test_1661,Always good food and good service. I love the green apple Boba here!!!!  Perfect string bean chicken lunch special. I've never had bad food here.
test_1662,"One of my favorite places to stay in Vegas while with a large posse of girls. 

Staff are always SO friendly-- their smiles and greetings are always genuine.  I typically stay in one of the suites... why is it that these things always have huge foyers?  Total waste of space, not that the luxury suites really need more space..."
test_1663,"Why did I have to come to this buffet on my last day?

The buffet at Bellagio is the pinnacle of Vegas buffetery (sp?)

When you see a line stretching out well beyond the buffet entrance and into a table of poker players, you'll know you found the right place.

Everything here is so good. If you hate something, give it a try here. They'll make it ""derricious"" and you'll be eating pig farts all day long.

Ok, I made that up, but if they served pig farts I am sure they would make it delectable.

I actually hate fish. I refuse to eat it. But I saw a lady grab a plate full of Chilean Sea Bass and I was enticed. Since she took all the sea bass, the chef promptly put out some fresh ones... Why not? I'll give it a shot.

Good lord, it's like eating bacon fat without the negative side effects.

I was sad I found out about this fish after I was done with the usual prime rib and crab faire, but I was leaving this place with a happy kind of full.

Desserts here are average. They have a lot of sugar free options but nothing really special.

My only complaint is that sauce like au jus and melted butter are in very weird and hard to find places. But once you get that down, you're in for a treat."
test_1664,"Nice place to fulfill your craving for spicy fruity snacks. They also have a killer shrimp tostada that is like a tower of shrimp and it's fresh and satisfying. I had their chamoyada and it was sooo good. The tamarind slush was perfect with chamoy and fresh mango, Japanese style penuts and bits of tamarindo, my daughter had the mangoneada and she loved the fresh mango slush with fresh mango bits. She also had the strawberries and cream and said they were super good. We will definitely be back to try more of their treats."
test_1665,"Not much to say about this little Starbucks that is located towards the entrance of Albertsons. Really like this Starbucks simply for the convenient location. Got groceries and then a pumpkin latte. Love the selection of travel mugs, but not willing to pay twenty dollars for one. Fast and friendly customer service."
test_1666,"We've shopped at this Loblaws for years and always had a good customer service experience throughout our shopping until most recently when they hired on this lady at one of the cash registers. 

This review is ONLY specific to ""Nancy"" who worked Till #11 on Sunday August 10th, and ended her shift at 7:30:

She left her till at the end of her shift and us (her last customers before her break) without a word, and did not assist us in finishing bagging our groceries.  She didn't even:
- say she was going, 
- ask us if we can finish bagging ourselves or if we needed help, or
- follow-through and finish HER JOB and bag our purchases. 

This is the second Sunday in which we so happen to be putting our purchases through her cash register and it's off-putting that she's consistently given us a terrible customer service experience. The previous incident was she barely used words or spoken language to communicate with us.  English may be your second language Nancy, but you're in Canada, you work at Loblaws, and you are in a position to provide customer service AND THAT REQUIRES TALKING. 

On top of that, when we wanted to leave a comment about our disappointing experience, there was no clear escalation protocol, or the employees weren't aware what was the escalation protocol, OR they were reluctant to participate in order to protect one of their own or save their own asses.

Loblaws employees may think that being unionized is an automatic shield from ""doing no wrong"", and I am deeply disappointed that we had to encounter these shopping experiences."
test_1667,"Came here with a friend who highly recommended this place.  He even ate here the day before taking us!

We ordered the buffalo chicken tacos, Korean beef tacos and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  I gotta say the fries were amazing!!!! I could eat them all day.  For the tacos I preferred the Korean beef ones more. It came with a type of slaw inside which was refreshing.  The buffalo chicken one reminded me more of a spicy mcchicken type of thing, but still good.  The great thing is that all tacos are only $8 everyday between 3-5pm. (Or maybe it was 2-5pm... Can't remember)

We will be coming back"
test_1668,"Judge a book by it's cover? Not here! 

Don't be fooled by the non-exciting signage outside or the plain ""diner"" interior! This place was recommended by foodie & yelp elitist Natalie T., so I was prepared to be wowed by the food & service & atmosphere!

If it were not for the girls & I passing this way to attend another event down the street, I would not have discovered this delectable eatery!


SERVICE
We arrived when it was still bright and sunny out (5:45pm), so it was easy to snag a seat. It was very thoughtful of the host-slash-waiter to give us the option of sitting where ever we pleased! Love having options! Secretly, seating is VERY important to me. I like - no I NEED - to sit where I can see the full view of the space! 

It is evident at the start that the staff here are exceptionally friendly and very inviting! However, while the taking of our order was prompt, the delivery was veeeeery s-l-o-w! The appetizers was a decent wait, but we probably waited 45 minutes for our entrees! I'm guessing they didn't want us to feel rushed, as the staff did approach our table often or looked our way to ensure we were in good hands. 


EAT THIS
CRABCAKES    $10
-soft meaty crabcakes with a creamy sauce and a nice surprise ""kick""! YUM! Tip: dip the soft freshly baked bread into the sauce! DIVINE!
DUCK CONFEIT   $20
-juicy lean duck drumsticks with creamy heavenly whipped potato and crunchy green beans and white carrots! DELISH! And oh-so-filling! 


AMBIANCE
Although, I wasn't immediately smitten by the interior, as soon as the lights went low, and the candles were lit, the space magically transformed to a whole other setting! Cozy, intimate, and romantic! TIP: Not good for large groups. Come early or risk waiting! Bar seating on your right, and booth seating for groups of 4 on your left. Great place to get chummy with your date, or for small group shenanigans!


PRICE
Affordable! Everything on the menu was less than $25 - average entree $20.
Great prices for downtown dinner!

We were all first timers for DINNER, and now fellow fans! But apparently BRUNCH here is all the rave! So BOOKMARK it! ..."
test_1669,"My experience was similar to Christi's below. We popped over to Free Range Brewing to try Joe's Doughs and Hiya was out front. I ordered the Bulgogi bowl. I was picturing rice topped with slices of thin beef in a sweet sauce. Crisp and savory meat with a sweet sauce to mop up with rice. I was thinking way ahead of myself. Instead I got clumpy, over cooked rice with chopped meat topped with lettuce drizzled with spicy mayo and a couple pieces of fluorescent pickled something. There were also cellophane rice noodles on one side...? Not at all what I expected. $9 - price isn't bad but the execution wasn't there."
test_1670,"Best pizza and wings in town! Honey BBQ Hot wings are the best, perfectly crispy and flavorful. We've even had their hot sandwiches before, also amazing! Not only do they have great food, but the staff is also very friendly every time we visit."
test_1671,"Really one of dirtiest places to eat,not sure how they get past the Health inspections,very rude staff and management. Spend your money elsewhere."
test_1672,"In La Mesa the internet is very spotting and ALWAYS intermittent. I have upgraded service packages over and over as well as had service calls periodically over the past two years and nothing changes in service while my bill continue to climb!
 
AT&T UVerse is not offered in my area, so I guess it is time to go to satellite. :( 

I hate you Cox!"
test_1673,"Hands down best donuts !! And drive thru, but it is a slow drive thru .... I have tried coffee.. I prefer a dark bold roast .. All in all I will return"
test_1674,"Great sushi. I did not place an order on the phone, I just showed up and ordered. Service was awesome. I ordered the Panko crusted crab and shrimp/veggie tempura. I was in a rush so I just went with the Bento Box 30 (for 2). No complaints whatsoever it was very good. I hear their specialties are awesome will order that next time :-)."
test_1675,"When you first walk into this place, it seems like an English afternoon tea cafe.  It's actually a cafe from Taiwan and part of a restaurant chain.

The food is very very very average, it's like average food dressed up in tuxedo, every drink has been dressed up with flakes of roses, fancy eh?  The chicken spaghetti was ok, although could be better if it was more flavourful.    The lychee strawberry drink that I got was nothing more than lychee juice you could buy from supermarket dressed up fancy with rose flakes.

Service was good and prompt, they even cut the toast for you.   The dinning time is 90 minutes maximum so it's not a place to chill for a long time.

The cafe gives good first impression with its design and feel but it lacks good food to compliment it."
test_1676,"It's McDonalds, what can you say. The workers are usually pretty nice and always get my order right. Only thing is that once, after ordering from here, one of the employees loudly told one of the others that my order was disgusting..."
test_1677,OMFG!!!!    this place is a dump!!!  i should stop trying to be cheap!!!
test_1678,"I wish there was an option for 0 stars... I went in, and asked them to take off my acrylics. They started to pick at them and rip them off with their nails. If I wanted to get them ripped off I would've done that myself. I then asked to soak them off and they groaned, but did it. They soaked for a bit and then they picked at the nails AGAIN. Which led to my pinky nail being ripped in half, I am missing the top half of my nail. Eventually the first girl got too annoyed so someone came to take over. She fixed them and then painted my nails. She left a little bit of acrylic on so its still there. And there are bubbles in the polish."
test_1679,"I have been with Geico for years..... always  thinking well this is the best I will ever do for insurance... I happen to be online looking around for some more reasonable priced insurance one day. I don't even remember checking out Farmers insurance, but I received a nice letter in my mail box with a quote on insurance that I could not even believe was true. I work some crazy hours and Ashlee dealt with all of  that and all my emails back and forth on info and setting me up with this awesome low price but excellent insurance for my home and my 2 cars. I will  be saving over 700 dollars a year with this insurance,,,, thank you Ashlee for all you done and assisting me... I really hate change but this change was wonderful because Ashlee was caring and so helpful"
test_1680,"This place has a small dance floor. But the music is great! A good mix of salsa, merengue, banda, etc  etc. It was free for ladies the night we went and $20 for men."
test_1681,"This pizza is awesome, definitely recommend if you are looking for something quick to sit down and eat. The pizza is a great price (for Vegas) and you could split it between 2 people as long as your not starving."
test_1682,"My daughter is 4 months and is currently enrolled at La Petite Academy. She's in the infant toddler room with Mrs. Ann and Monica. They are very loving and kind to her. Each day I AM updated by email when she naps, eats and even poops.. They email pics of her as well of her during her daily activities. I never thought I would need daycare with my baby being so young but I am happy I found LPA. Its a very clean facility in a safe area. The director Viana in always available at the site in case I have questions. I'm forever grateful for the staff at LPA."
test_1683,"Omg this food is amazing I have never had chicken tikka masala so fresh and authentic. I've been looking for a good Indian cuisine spot in Arizona for so long and this is now my #1
Oh yeah the staff is so nice very humble!!!!!"
test_1684,"I have never been to El Hefe at night, only for lunch or early happy hours so my review is for the food an ambiance during the daytime. I come here often for lunch, they have great street tacos, salsas and quesadillas. The happy hour is spot on with both food and drink specials from 3-7pm. Taco Tuesdays have $2 tacos and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice. 

While I can't speak to the night time atmosphere this is a great spot to grab lunch or happy hour on Mill."
test_1685,"I have been in the market and  working with this company for over 3 months now. They have been the best since day one. I opted out twice to place an order and they were still cordial. From helping with design, measuring and personal opinions, they were 5 stars all the way! I am looking forward to my install!"
test_1686,"Let me first just say that I am surprised this place only has 3 stars. It is definitely a great place to stay. We stayed here a few nights to attend TIFF. It's not a luxury hotel, but definitely a very clean and and above average hotel. I have stayed at Westins before and the rooms are generally average or smaller than the boutique hotels I usually stay at. I knew this going in. We were happy with our room, however. It was a corner room on a high floor as requested and we had a lake view. The heavenly beds are very comfortable. We enjoyed the in room Starbucks Coffee and Tea as well as the Heavenly beds.

Facilities...

Pool/Gym: We did use their pool and sundeck. If we had more time we would have used their tennis courts. The pool is not too bad and pretty clean. Looks better in person than in the picks. I was able to swim laps as they had a section for lap swimming. I love that the gym and pool are open from 5:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. IF you go early, it's not too crowded.

Location: The terminal to visit the Toronto Islands is directly behind the hotel which was a nice perk that we took advantage of. It is about a 7-10 minute walk to the Union Subway Station. It's near the CN Tower, Hockey Hall of Fame, and it is possible to find some adequate food options within walking distance. Of course there is a Tim Horton's directly across the street.

Bar/Lounge Area: Very clean and comfortable. Great place to meet up with others before going out. Drinks are expensive! $9 for a beer!  There are also two restaurants there which we did not have a chance to explore.


Service...

Parking/Valet: After a pleasant 8 hour drive from NYC we were tired and starting to show signs of fatigue. We had stopped at Niagara Falls just before and got really wet on the Hornblower tour of the falls. We didn't realize that we let on that we were tired. The attendant noticed this and asked if we would like Valet Parking for the same price of Self-Parking. I thanked the attendant and said she didn't have to, but it was much appreciated! Parking in Toronto is very expensive. $35 per day for self park and $45 per day for Valet. However, the good news is that there are in/out privileges. I wish I would have gotten the name of our attendant to write her a thank you!

Front Desk: Checking In & Out was pretty easy. Give yourself time to checkout as there may be a line. The staff was friendly. Make sure you sign up to be an SPG member if you are not already.

Concierge: All of the reps at the concierge were very friendly. One rep was a huge TIFF fan and we enjoyed speaking with her about our film choices. Another rep was helpful in finding many of the places we wanted to go to. However, we had a hard time extracting good restaurants out of them. Use Yelp for that! Minus 1/2 a star for that.


I subtracted another 1/2 star because I think this hotel should offer free Internet for all customers in their rooms. There is free Wifi in the lobby, so that helped a little bit.

Overall I would stay here again as I had a great experience."
test_1687,"Checked out Jimbo's, having heard of the good wings to be had. We were not disappointed. This is a good basic, dark, non-pretentious bar in a small strip-mall. A local's hangout. A couple of pool tables, a wall of dartboards and plenty of tv's showing various sports. Our margaritas were simple, basic and tasty but nothing overly fancy. The wings come with a variety of flavors served regular or extra crispy and are a must-try. They're advertised as dozen but it sure felt like quite a bit more on the plate, though we didn't take the time to count, just enjoyed 'em. We'll be back for more. The staff was friendly, attentive and just plain cool. If you're looking for a simple place to hang out, grab a few drinks and get some grub, check out Jimbo's."
test_1688,"I was visiting my home town of Toronto from Middle Georgia, where the word ""poutine"" might be mistaken for a french cuss word rather than a Canadian delicacy. Needless to say, the South is pretty devoid of cheese curds, so I am unable to enjoy this dish for the larger part of the year.

Having exhausted Poutini's the past few times I visited, I decided to give Big Smoke Burger a whirl. 

The service here was very good. With a lot of quick-service food places, you get the sense from the employees that they would rather be getting a root canal than to be slinging food at you. But at Big Smoke Burger, they were very pleasant, helpful and polite and seemed to enjoy working there, which adds to a pleasant dining experience, fast or not. 

I loved the fact that the gravy was veggie friendly. At least, that's how they hesitantly conveyed it to me, which I took at face value. I don't have meat allergies, so what I don't know can't hurt me if it actually was beef gravy. 

I ordered the spicy poutine which came with carmelized onions and I believe a spicy mayo sauce on top of all the other poutiney ingredients. 

It was good, but very comparable to all the other poutineries and did not stand out from any other poutines I have ingested. 

I decided to kick up the spice level a few thousand scovilles but when I inquired about hot sauce, they informed me that they do not have any and that the spicy mayo was the spiciest sauce they had on hand. 

I think if they added a bottle of Sriracha to their condiment section it would really enhance an o.k. poutine to a really good poutine. So for me, it stayed at an o.k. poutine.

But that's o.k. Not all poutines were meant to be outstanding. I might be back to check out their veggie burger because I have heard great things about it. But I will have to remember to bring my travel Sriracha bottle."
test_1689,Best breakfast buffet in USA I say. I hate buffets but love the Bellagios for breakfast. The coffee is better than starbucks. Understand there may be a line but its well worth it. Came here for my wifes 30th birthday breakfast and look..shes picky and high falootin and still loves it. Maybe she wont admit it...but....
test_1690,Great place! I really needed my dress dry cleaned for an event tomorrow. Two previous places I went to couldn't have my dress ready the same day. I came here and it was no problem. Dropped it off at around 9:30AM and was able to pick it up around the 3:00PM hour. It was a wonderful experience.
test_1691,"Went here before a show at Comerica. Parked in the garage attached - all was within easy walking distance. Parking was spendy ($24). Food was spendy. Service here was TERRIBLE. I dont know if our server was new (she was shaking, many of her words were inaudible, she down sold beer...) or what. I spent good money on appetizers and she removed them from the table before our food came out and without asking - this is not only rude, but a waste of $$/food. I should have grabbed it back or said something, but she was fast lol. Food was good. Beer was good. Overall a fun evening, but service will prevent me from coming again. There are lots of other options downtown."
test_1692,"This is located in one of those buildings where many businesses come and go so I tend not to pay attention. Finally I realized just how long Crostini has been there; must be doing something right!

We did a pick up order. It was a little chaotic on the pick up and pay. They didn't seem to know if some items were packaged or not. I didn't know if we'd find things missing or duplicated. From other reviews it seems like that's part of the adventure. In actuality only a cookie with the kid's sandwich was missing. 

Our group ordered a Rueben, Italian beef, Italian combo (beef+sausage), a kid's turkey sub, and an egg salad sandwich. Everyone like their food and no one was seriously disappointed at the size but ""there should have been more egg salad for the amount of bread.""

The kid's meal was missing the cookie and had no mayo or mustard on it which we found odd but we just added our own. The Italian beef was quite good but not Chicago good where both diners grew up.)

We will definitely order from there again when the time is right. It's right in our neighborhood and a good delicious time was had by all."
test_1693,"My insurance company recommend Hydro-Pro carpet cleaners to fix a leak in my shower.
First off my insurance company said they were plumbers and a drywall/plumbing company that takes care of everything.
Well loose lips sink ships. 
Thank's Jennifer!
The other plumber was Dave Capko from ""Ideal Plumbing"" same office as Ray Odom the plumber from Hydro-Pro carpet cleaner/plumbing!
I just needed to follow this paper trail.
Dave Capko's line was disconnected when I called.
No wonder my insurance adjuster was told that Ray take care of it!
Lie number one.
I had a simple problem that has now lasted  3 weeks from the start when Ray Odom showed up with his thermal camera.
I had a leak coming from my shower that buckled my wall a little bit.
Ray Odom proclaimed ""Oh you have a leak"" 
My reply was yes I can see that Ray.
You would think if a plumber showed up at your house he would start the process.
Did he NO!
Ray Odom said he would be back with my insurance adjuster.
Patrick from Farmers Insurance came on time.
We both waited for Ray Odom. 
Ray Odom finally showed up!
Ray Odom said he had to open up my wall.
Ray Odom was 45 minutes late he should have apologized to Patrick from Farmers Insurance for waiting around for him. 
Ray Odom had no apology to me!. 
Ray Odom treats women terribly and tries to dismiss me.
I am not a women you dismiss.
Ray Odom found the problem there was a leak where ceramic tile sealant should have been put when the house was built.
Ray showed up again on Thursday I thought he was there to work he set up these fans to dry the water in my wall.
To which shocked my mind because the shower was not used for 2 weeks by this time.
It was dry already. 
Ray Odom also told my insurance company Farmers I had mold.
Ray Odom told me I had no mold just water that needed to be dried.
Ray Odem told me he could not stay and do my work because there were larger problems with people who have flooded homes.
Ray blew me off and said he did not work weekends because he likes to ride his motor cycle.
Why I thought is Ray here? His office girl Jennifer told me he was coming every day when I called. 
Ray never came on time and spent a total of 2 hours that was his longest stretch.
He came to my home 4 times and this project started in late August!
It is now mid September.
Never ever have I had I had so much mayhem.
Later yesterday a dry wall man showed up named Omar he said why isn't the tile work done? 
I said Ray Odom has not finished that yet.
Lie # 2. Yes Ray Odom said he would be finished.
Omar also said there is no sealant put on that needed to dry.
Once again the undependable Ray Odom sent a dry wall man out who was in shock.
Omar called Ray Odom on loud speaker Ray said just don't worry about any sealant or the tile.
Omar asked him about the missing tile.
Ray Odom said he would knock it out from the other side! 
That side has NOTHING wrong with it.
Omar just shook his head and kept saying he was so sorry.
Omar is a nice man he kept saying Ray Odom is a bad man.
I agreed.
I am so tired of having this 3 day project take 3 weeks. 
Don't count of their promises Hydro-Pro Ray Odom will leave you empty handed without fixing the problem.
Ray Odom will not work weekends bad business decisions! 
That was the missing piece to this puzzle.
I bet if it was a home flooded Ray Odom would be at that house on the weekends that = more money!
A handshake means nothing to Ray he said he would come and lied to me.
Ray Odom is a piece of work if he shows up it's hours too late.
Lie # 2 RAY ODOM GAVE ME HIS WORD THAT HE COULD DO THE JOB.
DON'T EVER USE HYDRO-PRO IN SCOTTSDALE, OR ANY OTHER PART OF PHX.
RAY ODEM IS A COMPLETE FAILURE IN MY BOOK.
RAY IS A PSYCHOTIC MAN WHO WILL CONTINUE TO LIE.
RAY SHOULD BE TAKING SOME KIND OF MEDICATION.

****BEWARE LADIES******
BEWARE ALL WOMEN RAY ODOM WILL TRY TO TALK OVER YOU AND BLOW OFF YOUR PROJECT.
DON'T GIVE THIS MAN ANY MONEY.
RAY ODOM WALKED OFF MY JOB AND THAT WAS IT AS HE MUMBLED SOMETHING DEROGATORY UNDER HIS BREATH.
RAY ODOM WILL MAKE A HOLE IN YOUR WALL AND NOT COME BACK AND FIX IT.
FOOL ME ONCE SHAME ON YOU, FOOL ME TWICE SHAME ON ME.

test_1694,I've gone twice to Nohea Nails. Although a bit pricey and the location in the Gramercy is kind of a PITA - the ladies doing work there do not disappoint!
test_1695,"farm to table pizza is truly difficult to find, especially if you want gluten free.  This is the only pizza place I will go to in Charlotte.  Props for using quality ingredients!"
test_1696,"We visited Petinos during the long-weekend for the first time. From our research, we only found 3 locations of the brunch spot and chose to visit the Laval branch due to the great reviews. It was there that we discovered that they recently opened in the South Shore but ah well, it was worth the drive!

We arrived around 12ish which is usually when the crowds are clearing at breakfast places but there was still quite a line up. It was a Saturday and long weekend, so it was expected I guess. We waited approximately 15-20minutes and were given a super warm welcome by the lady taking the names... It was a pleasure to meet her, she was friendly and full of life! Despite being very busy, they really have excellent service and attention. For the service alone, I would definitely return. Our waiter understood our special meal requests without us even having to explain and immediately knew how to amend our orders to suit us! Very impressive!

My husband and I both ordered from the Monteregie section (it was super difficult to nail it down to one selection as the menu is never ending! We both wanted eggs, potatoes and waffles so it was the perfect combination for us! Every single thing on the plate was mouth-watering and delicious. I would happily go back just to devour a whole plate of home-style potatoes - they were perfect! I found it difficult to finish my plate as even half a waffle is huge - I had the waffle with oreos and Nutella! I was in heaven  This kept me full all day!

Overall, extremely impressed by the quality of the food, the impeccable service and hospitality and the coffee/tea refills throughout! They really know how to spoil their clients. 
Petinos has easily become my favourite breakfast/brunch spot and I cannot wait to try the South-Shore branch to see if it does Laval justice"
test_1697,"I've been a member for almost a year.  Price is ok, not the best in the city, but location is why I go here.
The 6am classes are the best - worth every penny.
The cinema room is very cool.

Issue comes in their billing.  Golds gym on more than one occasion has decided to randomly take extra money out of my account without notifying me.  Once it was handled by the management in house, they were really nice & credited me the month after they decided that my membership was going to be $19.99 (which was not in my contract agreement).

This month, however, I spoke to Justine - who was a total jerk on the phone.  She said that they tried taking money out of my account on 4 different days in the month - which is exactly when I get paid, so I can't even explain why they said the account was declined.  
Either way, they decided to go ahead and charge me a late fee of MORE THAN DOUBLE my monthly membership dues. 
Not only that - they never called me, never emailed me, AND when I came into the gym and they swiped my card, NEVER told me there was a problem!!!

With attitude, Justine basically said 'there's nothing I can do, you have to call ABC'  some outside company that assesses the charges. So I get to wait on hold with them...

I constantly have to watch over this company and make sure that I'm being charged the correct amount every month.

Great gym, shady billing"
test_1698,"Sort of the airport version of your frat days.  Local Carolina beers on tap with bar food to boot. This is the place for serious drinking at CLT.  And why not?  TSA can't see you from here.  Watch those insurance salesmen loosen their ties as they go round 4.
Concourse D."
test_1699,"Usually I don't pay much attention to the negative reviews of a place, as we like to form our own opinion but...lesson learned.

Table of 6 was sat pretty quickly after we called and were told in a very valley girl accent that they were ""like......10 deep.""

Our server was great. I've seen reviews about bad service, but ours was really attentive. 

Great old fashioned drinks there. Highly suggest.

Here's where the yelp reviews are true:

Avocado toast is SUPER lemony. Overpowering to the whole dish.

Lobster Mac and cheese is fettuccini (which is accurately presented on the menu.) it's not macaroni, which let's be honest...is what we're all looking for. The lobster Mac and cheese at Namastay Kitchen is better. Seriously. 

Biggest charcuterie board only comes with 5 tiny pancakes to use with the cheese. We had to ask for extra. 

And speaking of the charcuterie board, I've seen complaints about things on their website menu being a different price when you get to the restaurant. This is absolutely true. The full blown charcuterie board online was $36, and when we got there it was $50. $50 FOR A CHARCUTERIE BOARD? I'm sorry...I'm not sure you got that. It was $50! I'd love those margins if I were Zeppelin. 

My advice is go grab a drink and a snack, and leave. Immediately."
test_1700,"It's all about the mobster feel and old school Las Vegas vibe here. Old Vegas celebrity pictures line the walls and you feel like you've stepped back in time to when Frank and Dean were the kings of the strip. 

It is a very unique restaurant but with a fairly limited menu. It was good, not great but it's more about the experience I think. We had a great time. I thought it was better than your average pasta joint and I'd probably go back. Maybe not the next time I'm in Vegas but maybe once every couple of visits."
test_1701,"Our first time to visit Block & Grinder will certainly not be our last!
My husband (a Culinary Institute of America Chef graduate) and our two dear ""foodie"" friends decided to try it out!
We all checked out the menu and reviews prior to our reservation and wanted to see this unique concept and try out their interesting menu.
We were hesitant at first as few (very few) of the reviews were not very good. Leads me to wonder if their critique is an example of their experiences every place they sample?

Let me say this first, those negative reviews are not reflective of our experience at all! We has a delightful experience!

It began with our reservation we needed to push back 30 minutes because we had a delay. They were more than accommodating on a busy Friday night, and we enjoyed waiting at the bar having great and interesting cocktails from a bar well dressed in interesting spirits & friendly knowledgable bartenders!
The bar & dining area are a bit small, but from our research prior to our visit, we were prepared for that, NO problems here! As I said, bartenders were attentive and very quick at taking our drink order. Plus, a small bar area only lends itself to easy, fun conversation and the ability to share great conversation with other patrons! 
Our cocktails were great. The guys chose the Maple Manhattan, wonderful and their Dark & Stormy, that is an interesting and delicious black rum and ginger beer combo.

Our waiter John was exceptional, offered great commentary of the dishes and very knowledgable about wine offerings.  Wonderful personally!

We all shared deviled eggs and beef  carpaccio, we loved the carpaccio, but the deviled eggs needed a bit of seasoning and were pleasantly supplied with their own blend of seasoning salt, one mesquite flavored, the other their own mixture pared well as the accent needed. Awesome! 

The guys shared the bone in ribeye and short ribs. OUTSTANDING! The veggie sides were farm to marker local and the best green beans I ever had, nice preparation and flavor. Beef was absolutely seasoned and prepared to perfection! 
We girls shared the shiitake mushroom with gruyere cheese burger cooked medium on a delicious bun.... RIDICULOUSLY delicious! The pommes frites      again, perfectly seasoned, and green beans delicious! The grits with the short rib dish also great! 

Finish with the table splitting the  brandy bread pudding (thanks waiter John) and call it a win!

Cool, decor, great ambiance, outstanding service and food worthy of my hubby's praise (that don't come easy) and a table side visit from the chef, made dining at B&G a memorable first impression! Add in fabulous table conversation, this place is surly to be on all 4 of our must do list of great places to dine in Charlotte!"
test_1702,"Before I get into the food, the atmosphere is the first thing that catches your eye obviously. It's set up like a cross between a 50's diner and a casino lounge. The waitresses are dressed the part, too. 

My wife and I got there on a Monday morning around 10 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. And the food... restaurants always claim to have ""huge portions."" This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too. 


Another bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely go out of our way to stop here a"
test_1703,"I came here because of a cat with special dietary needs--the food selection at Petco/Petsmart just wasn't cutting it anymore. Wow, does ATYS ever have a huge selection! It was a little overwhelming really, but one of the employees (also a vet student) listened to what I was looking for in a food and helped point me to a few brands/varieties that fit the bill. 

Helpful, reasonable prices, knowledgeable staff. Yep, this is my new pet store!"
test_1704,"Went to see Tracy Morgan in the showroom last night. It does not smell of cigarette smoke like the casino floor does! Yay..The seats were great and the employees were helpful in finding seats, friendly and the bar serves plenty of cold drinks. Overall a hilarious show as I expected. I really do wish they had a better casino air filtration. still a decent casino and good options for late night eating."
test_1705,"I came by this evening for eyebrow threading; the threading session took about 3 minutes for a basic clean up.  

Verdict: Mediocre job and service."
test_1706,"I've taken my kids here several times, and we've never had to wait more then 5 minutes. We go right up, sign in, and they usually call us back right as I'm done signing their paperwork. The doctors have always been super nice. My daughter had stitches done, and she was a nervous wreck. The staff tried so hard to make her comfortable and gave her a stuffed toy when she was done. It was very nice. I wish they would open a bit earlier in the day...otherwise, they're great."
test_1707,"I just realized that I have not Yelped this spot.   The food is above average sports bar food.   I have never had a bad meal there.........   Keep in mind, it is a quasi sports bar - combined with nightly food and drink specials, makes for a busy place.   They have done a good job remodeling, but even with the open side seating area, there is usually a wait.

My family and I have been doing Thursday night $5 burger night.   It's five bucks, build your own burger.   Choice of side.   Their fries rock, extra crispy and very good.    My family usually gets the burg with bacon, avocado, saut√©ed onions and cheddar cheese.  You cannot beat it!!!!!!  What has really frost my ass, they used to have $3.50 local draft on Thursday, that was a rocking deal, but no more...... sniff sniff.

So, other misc. comments.   Wings are decent, above average.  Nachos rock, I think they use real velvetta, its nice and creamy, yum yum.   HINT - they ran a Yelp Check In offer for a free app last year.   It came up last week when I checked in....... Saweet.   Seared Tuna app is small, but really great.

5 star for local craft beer, rotating taps.   Yum Yum.  Dilly dilly.  Cheers.

On a bad note, they get so busy, the servers have to work there ass off, every server my family has ever had, has never been friendly or even smiled.   By no means, was service bad, maybe slow at times, but their face would break if they smiled."
test_1708,"I had a lot of construction debris from my remodel and other large patio and household items that I needed cleared from my backyard.  Eric from Super Junk  Removal responded with a very competitive quote and did the job beyond my satisfaction.  He showed up the next day with his crew and was very courteous.  If you need this type of service,  Super Junk Removal is your company - look no further! You won't be sorry  Thank you Eric for giving me a good service at a good price"
test_1709,After reading the great reviews I was so happy to have found this dentist! Had my first visit today and everyone was so nice and comforting! I would recommend anyone needing dental work to check this place out!
test_1710,"I went on the weekend with some friends. The service was ok but the food wasn't worth it. I got the lille fluk thing and steak frittes to share. The lille pizza thing wasn't good, just way to much mushrooms and not enough cheese.  There isn't any sauce, so it pretty much tasted like a cracker with a bunch of mediocre toppings. The steak was ok could have used  more flavour. The only thing that was good was the garlic fries that came with the steak. Overall it just wasn't worth it. I wouldn't eat there again."
test_1711,"My family and I  decided to grab a small bite here and I  can say they definitely have never let us down! We got the hummus with seared ahi tuna, probably my FAVORITE thing there, quite a big portion and filling. It was definitely worth the splurge! The costumer service there was better than I expected. This girl, I  believe her name was Hadley, brought us our food, very sweet! They kept checking in to make sure everything was okay for us! Super cute and friendly place and will come back again soon!!"
test_1712,"Ive only been to one other chiropractor. But this facility is awesome. So many different areas, and they really go in depth explaining everything to you. From the treatments to all that your spine and nerve endings control. If you need some adjusting i recommend Active Life."
test_1713,"I've been here twice now at different times of the day, each time was a great experience  my bartender made sure I had a cold beer in hand always and the food was always on point"
test_1714,Cherletta was very sweet and patient. She helped get me my dress online so I wouldn't have to buy a dress of the rack for my wedding. Had a great experience!
test_1715,My experience in the past was good but today I went to pick up my car and was told because Iam a local I showed provide all my documentation for my insurance where is shows my actual full coverage  I said office wasn't opened they told me to call and guy at the counter was very reluctant to help me and told me to go to another rental place you lost all my business and I will let all my friends know not to use you in future.
test_1716,"If you want to know the strength of a buffet, go during dinner because that's where they pull all their guns out. We got comped so it was a no-brainer what meal to use it on.

I'll say outside of maybe the prime rib and crab legs, it was a really an average spread. Even the dessert bar wasn't anything to get excited about. They had the usual suspects: pizza, mac n cheese, Chinese food, sushi, etc. but I had a hard time figuring out what to get because I don't like to waste my appetite of fillers like carbs. 

At $30 a pop it isn't outrageous, but it could be better. Our server also was just ok so that's adds to the experience too. Considering the ton of restaurants inside the resort, I kind of expect the buffet to step it up. MGM isn't known for their buffet and now I know why."
test_1717,"Bad customer service. Do not go here!!!
I had a treatment and it worked for about an hour but then later that night my neck had the same pain. I don't think that she knew what she was doing. She didn't even look at my tongue. I have had a lot of acupuncture.

I went here because when I walked by they were offering a free day at the end of the month. I was hurting the day after I made the appointment so I called the same people. Because I made the 2nd appointment and went in to that one first I didn't qualify for the free day since I am ""now a patient"". What kind of customer service is this?"
test_1718,"I usually use Clean Air Cab but their rate from my house to the airport is $25.00, so after seeing all the adds for Triple A Yellow Cab and their $15 rate, I thought I would give them a try.  BIG MISTAKE.

I called the night before my flight and asked for a 6:30 am pickup.  Received a confirmation and the dispatcher's name.  At 6:30, however, no cab arrived.  By 6:45 I called and was told that the taxi was on its way, and that I had ""plenty of time"" to make my flight.  When I told the dispatcher that I was meeting co-workers at the airport and that I specifically requested a 6:30 pick up time, she replied ""that's not how we work"".  I called back at 6:55, still no taxi, and was told the car was on its way, but this time the location of the car was farther away from my house than what I was first told.  I asked for the dispatcher's name, and she replied ""why do you want that""?  Of course no supervisor was unavailable as well.  I ended up having to scramble and drive myself to the airport.

Do not use this company if you need to get to the airport at a specific time.  You only have yourself to blame if you do so and end up late..."
test_1719,"Great Place! Excellent, friendly service. Tasty food. Been here three times and tried many selections from the menu (not sushi). All were very good!! Pretty good atmosphere. Can be noisy when crowded. Reasonable prices and portions."
test_1720,"The portion is huge but mostly fries and less fish. Coleslaw and tartar sauce needs to be ordered as a side. This can make their less expensive dish $10 go up to $15+. The sides should be included. The fish and chips definitely needed the tartar sauce to help cut all the grease. It's ok, not sure I'd go back."
test_1721,"I really like Ten Spot, and they do a great brazilian here. Always a good experience, despite the pain!! Only thing is, it's stupid expensive! That makes this my ""special occassions"" waxer. All the girls that work at Ten Spot are really nice, and the service is great. I love that I can book an appt online, easy easy. Having tried both, I definitely prefer Ten Spot to Fuzz Wax Bar, check my profile to compare reviews."
test_1722,I bought a car from them six months later the AC compressor goes out and the warranty that comes with the car does not cover that but there mechanics fixed it for around $650 which isn't bad and they put it on a payment plan my car runs good haven't had any problems for having a high milage ten year old car when I went to JD Byrider my credit was really bad and my car was on its last leg and I was stressed about getting to work so when I bought a car from here I was happy I had reliable transportation and my credit score has gone up like two hundred points everybody that works there is really helpful except DeeDee who's a collection manger she is really unprofessional she lies and is not good at her job at all other then that and paying three times the value of my car  I feel good about giving them my business and suggest it to others because they helped me when I needed it and in the end my credit is going to be a lot better so when I do go buy a new car I should have no problem getting what I really want
test_1723,"I found this cute little niche spot for lunch when I was working nearby. I was excited to have a variety of vegetarian and vegan options. I also like the relaxed atmosphere and artsy vibe. You order at the counter, and find a seat. I sat on the patio, as it was a sunny and balmy 68¬∞ . The machiatto coffee was really good with coconut milk .
I ordered the Roasted Veggie wrap which comes out warm and with the tortilla grilled on the outside. When the plate was first put in front of me, I was a little surprised that it didn't come with a small side of hummus or salsa that typically accompanies wraps, and also missing was any side at all. No chips, grapes, fries, not even a pickle spear. Nothing at all. So it was a wrap on a big empty plate. I did ask for something for a sauce, and they were accommodating, and brought me some balsamic vinaigrette, and some vegan cheese they call Pleezsh. I will give them the wrap is delicious! The Pleezsh actually was the icing in the cake. It enhanced everything so much more. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. However, I do think it is a bit spendy especially considering that there are no sides, and think that should be considered on their wrap or sandwich plates in the future. But, overall nice vibes, friendly staff, and great food!"
test_1724,"I dig this place. Quality drinks for a low price.

Parlour is one if the more recent renovations made in the El Cortez. It has a bit of an old school vibe to it all the way from the decor, to the bartender. Despite the rather cheap drink prices, they do not skimp on quality. I ordered a gin and tonic ($4) and my buddy ordered a specialty cocktail ($9). Drinks got a thumbs up from me. There are way too many bars around the downtown area that give me a drink that tastes watered down.

Towards the later hours there's usually some live music playing. There was some guy on piano doing covers of all sorts of mellow pop songs. Props for throwing some Regina Spektor in the mix.

All in all, I'm impressed with this place. This has become my new area to kick back when I'm waiting for a seat at Le Thai."
test_1725,Hey for all you can eat sushi it was amazing !!!! sake was good ...service was fabulous friendly kind and fast and they play great music ..thanks omg you guys rock!!!!
test_1726,Best place in Vegas to get a fade kaleb hooked it up will definelty be coming back whenever I'm im in Vegas
test_1727,Portions huge.  Service was great. Everything tasted great. Did the family meal with 2 entrees and soup and egg rolls. Great prices would definitely come back again.
test_1728,"Pasta was great, portions were HUGE. Bread was amazing. Will definitely return. We had the linguini with clams, veal parm, and pasta bolognese"
test_1729,"Change in ownership , now Vietnamese , is reflected in the product . A salty ,not tasteless mess topping with a soggy unattachable crust .Friendly people.An overall definite deterioration  . Try Vesuvio's"
test_1730,i really like this part of town...the sams clubs are always busy though...its best to go in the morning because after the afternoon the lines start getting long! and people in line have alot of item so you can imagine just how long it takes! overall everything seems clean and they have a great freindly staff...
test_1731,I went to Lifted Trucks to obviously look for a truck. I was very specific on what I wanted. They didn't have anything on their lot that I liked. I told the salesman that and he wouldn't let me leave. SUPER Pushy and kept trying to sell me something I didn't want. I was looking for a Diesel truck and the salesman didn't know anything at all about diesel trucks. Just because a motor is the same size don't mean they don't change things year to year. Finally I just walked out on them in the middle of the salesman talking....   I would not recommend them to anyone.
test_1732,"We had an amazing experience here. The fish was extremely fresh, the service was spot on and the atmosphere was very sophisticated. Each delicate piece of sushi was made with such thought and precision. The meal was not cheap, but you pay for what you get.  I feel we truly experienced the art of sushi at Yasu! We will be back soon!"
test_1733,"We stopped by here yesterday. This is a 20-acre park with tennis & volleyball courts plus a lake, waterfall & dinosaur-themed kids area.

The waterfall is so beautiful, sadly the lake is filled with trash around the corner. It is so charming to see the lake filled with ducks and a small trail with benches... The dinosaur theme is pretty cool. Splash pad for the kids when it's hot.

I loved the lake but for me, it was too close to the street, and so it was noisy and was not peaceful. People were constantly feeding the ducks, geese and the birds. There is duck and goose poop everywhere. You can't walk in the grass there because there is so much of it.

In addition, there are Horseshoe pits, volleyball and tennis courts too.

As with any other parks, it looks like it gets crowded on the weekend. If your child is into dinosaurs, this is the place to be."
test_1734,"Dunkin Donuts has better edibles than Starbucks, just my opinion. This location is newer and is kept clean with decent customer service. They have some very tasty frozen drinks and some people like the coffee here better than Starbucks, after all it's cheaper and if it tastes better to you, even better. They have a drive-thru as well as a large area where you can sit down and eat or drink your breakfast."
test_1735,"I love the house BBQ sauce. Also the Mac & Cheese was verrrry good. We finished the meal with the two desserts, the Banana Pudding and the Raspberry glazed cheesecake topped doughnut. Both were amazing!"
test_1736,"I love Pizza Pizza in general due to their ability to make ordering so easy. They have the mobile apps that can take order for you and customize to your liking. On top of that the deals are pretty good too.

This review is strictly for the Grand Park location. Through my experience, they are rather quick with their orders. Always on time and staff are polite while serving you. However, the pizza are hit or miss. One day it can be amazing and others the flavors are a little off. I've had an experience where my pizza didn't taste fresh and a little cold on top of that but I've also experience times where I wish I had more.

If this location can provide consistency with the pizza, I would definitely rate it a little higher. I would still recommend to not stray away from pizza pizza since their product are just too good."
test_1737,"We would technically give this restaurant a 3.5, if possible. It began as a 5 and wouldn't have had a hard time keeping it, if it weren't for a few key things at the end of our meal. 

We were charged $8 to swap out the pan seared atlantic salmon's rice for penne pasta. We were not told about this difference in price. If we were told about it, we would have passed on the ""upgrade"", as there's not enough of a difference between rice and pasta to warrant $28 vs. $20. 

My girlfriend and I went here in part for her birthday, and we ordered dessert in the form of creme brulee and cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The creme brulee was for her, and this was mentioned when I called in advance to see if we had to make reservations and what they had for birthday girls :) I was served her creme brulee, and she was served my cheesecake with ""Happy Birthday"" written in sauce, minus the scoop of ice cream! We were charged for that scoop of ice cream. 

The food was very good! The lemon cream sauce w/the salmon was especially fantastic, but being charged an extra $11 is relatively significant, and is what kept this place from being a 5 in our book."
test_1738,"This is our favorite fish and chip shop!  I find fish and chips are expensive take out to begin with, but its worth it.  We have always had super friendly dining experiences, and they are very family friendly.  

The Greek salad is also an amazing addon, but be sure to ask for dresssing on the side."
test_1739,Really deserves a one star. Calamari was fried hard and tough. Pizza was mediocre at best. Went with several people who all ordered different items. No one really cared for the food. The service was so so slow so many better options. I won't be back. We were at the Ballantine location
test_1740,"I was so excited to see this Outback was now open for lunch.  I cannot get enough of Outbacks salad.  Not that it is anything spectacular by any means.  It's just usually fresh and well chilled.  Service is so

Like seriously slow... The first time I came I chopped it up to being newly opened for lunch and still figuring out staffing but nope!  I've been here 3 times and it sucks.  I order the endless soup and salad with barely enough time to eat even the salad.

-love soupless in Phoenix"
test_1741,"Took the ""after hours"" brew tour last week. Tour guide Brian was extremely knowledgeable about the beer-making process. Certainly an adequate number of samples were had at the 4 breweries toured. The only complaint was that the dinner at Penn Brewery was the 3rd of 4th stops. That means you're sampling beers on likely an empty stomach (tour departed at 5:30) so several of us felt the food should've been at the first or second brewery. No food till the 8pm hour not ideal!"
test_1742,Alot of kids work here all they Do is talk about there personal life at a check out stand with there back facing toward you. Lack of customer service.. Just horrible go to another store
test_1743,Stumbled upon this place around midnight. Ordered a seafood pancake and it was awesome. Another reviewer said they didn't have a lot of seafood but mine was packed! Guess depends on the chef maybe? Will definitely come here again to try other dishes!
test_1744,"Nope. Never going back.
10pm at night, empty waiting area, and we wait 3 hours to be seen.  
The MA taking vitals has NO bedside manner for working with children.  And this place only serves children, so that's a huge turn off.  The receptionist clearly wanted to be elsewhere.  I get it, being at work is not the best, but it's part of being a grown up, so at least fake being friendly?
The doctor was too fast.  I don't feel like he spent even 5 minutes with us.  I don't think he listened to our problem, I don't think he gave my child a proper exam for the complaint presented, and I don't think he was all that great with kids either.  
For being a new facility, as in they just moved here, it was dirty.  Things were dusty, the floor needed a good sweeping and mopping.  The exam rooms were dingy and several lights were already burned out in the place.  
I was desperate, couldn't wait until the following morning for the urgent care we usually go to, and the ER would be overkill for the issue.  
But I do not recommend Good Night. At all."
test_1745,Been here twice. One of the tastiest Americanos I've ever had. So rich! Not sure what they're doing right. Free wifi and a fair bit of workspace. They just need more comfortable seats.
test_1746,"Very trendy and tasty restaurant. I recommend only purchasing what you intend to eat. The portions are very large and you don't want to end up wasting money by ordering something you can't finish. Try the Kiwi Watermelon vodka cocktail, very tasty."
test_1747,Maria's is where I go when I want some good cheap traditional Mexican food! It is a great place that always has good service and is owned and operated by Maria who is super nice.... really good food and daily drink specials!!
test_1748,"Go for the funky furniture, stay for the Swedish meatballs and lingonberry jelly . 
I had a latent urge to whinny and gallop after I ate, I don't know why. LMAO!
There are excellent bargains on glassware in their kitchen area. 
Two star deduction for lack of service.
The bedside lamp that showed in stock on their website - wasn't available."
test_1749,Went here for the first time since I've been hearing a lot about this place. I had the double charburger with avocado and no onions. The wait wasn't long at all and it was pretty delicious. The fries were tastey as well and it's an appropriate amount of fries. I'd recommend going here definitely.
test_1750,"Lines, lines, lines, lines, oh and more lines for tokens! 3rd year and don't remember the lines being so ridiculous! Will think twice about going next year"
test_1751,"There was the best vibes in this restaurant as I walked in. There was a nice morning buzz is people chatting, laughing, and the sound of clinking silverware. It was what the expected in places like breakfast joints. This location is seemingly better in popularity than the one on Sunset, and I've heard that the one on sunset road has more grease, and does not look/deem too tasty to others. 
I was with my friends and we had Blade serve us--she was great! Really chill and laid back, but willing to always be alert to everything and anything that we needed. She was courteous, and made sure our orders were all placed and correctly written down. 
Our food took a maximum of only about ten to fifteen minutes to come out."
test_1752,Extremely overpriced. Poor customer service. After paying 60 dollars for 2 kids to race once we had to wait 1.5 hours to race. Would prefer other options in the area. Save your money and go to Go Pro Motorplex. Won't be back!
test_1753,"Gorgeous hotel! Beautiful casino, great restaurants, friendly service and plenty of pools. Our favorite part is that all the rooms are suites, I was able to convince a friend who had booked a suite elsewhere, to stay here with us. Our second time, her first time, we all had a great time. 

Make sure to become a gratzi club member, but have them go over the details with you before you spend any money at the hotel. We spent a ton of money at cabanas, restaurants and gambling, only to find out afterwords that everything you want counted to the club must be billed to the room. Oops. A reminder at the tables for the club card would be nice too."
test_1754,"It was my first time to Union Social Eatery last night and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  When I first saw their menu I was sort of wondering how a place could have such a diverse menu from such things as sushi rolls to vindaloo chicken to swordfish but yes they do it.

I can't speak for all the menu items but we did get a chance to try a lot because Kris (GTA CM) held a CM event and as usual treated us to an array of apps which were generously passed around for everybody to try.  We had nachos, truffle fries, wings, flat bread, calamari from what I could remember.  The quality of the food was great.  The wings were really different but they were divine. 

While I was speaking to everybody I could, Bilal who I've met only once before said he was a regular there and he highly recommended the swordfish burger.  I had noticed there were several menu items featuring the swordfish (swordfish tacos, swordfish burger and swordfish dinner).  I had to take his word for it because he said it was awesome.

I had ordered my swordfish burger which came on a really interesting bun.  Like an Ace bakery bun but not as spongy as a ciabatta.  It was almost as if it was just baked and it was great.  The swordfish burger was grilled and was topped with charred leeks, grilled onions, roasted red peppers and mayo.  It was a great combination and the swordfish wasn't dry.  The last time I had swordfish it was a thick cut but was dry but it was at a different place.

The fries that normally come with the meal are Yukon gold but I had subbed it with their version of poutine.  It wasn't a great poutine since the cheese they used seemed to be shredded cheddar, I could be wrong but for sure it wasn't cheese curds.  Still the burger was awesome and is a really nice change from the everyday kind of sandwiches I would have or would have access to.  I chose the swordfish because I don't have the chance to order it often and this menu again was very diverse.

They even had options to sub out your fries for a sushi roll instead for an additional charge.  

What made the night special is that Mondays they feature craft beers and this evening it was Great Lakes Brewery's ""Yel-PA"" as in Yelp Pale Ale.  This was a specially made beer for Yelp coordinated by Kris and Great Lakes which is offered at select restaurants in the GTA and also available at the Great Lakes Brewery store near Queensway and Royal York in Etobicoke.

One dollar of every Yel-PA sold is being donated to the Daily Food Bank while supplies last.

This restaurant while it was a CM event was also a really nice place to get together.  We had a group around 11 or 12 and from what I could gather everybody was comfortable and the evening was filled with great food, great drink and great conversation.  

Union Social Eatery is a nice facility which has good lighting and a good all around vibe.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  We didn't have to wait long for anything as service was great.  I can't say I have anything negative to mention at all.  The place was great all around.

I would come back here to try more of the menu as one meal for me here just won't be good enough."
test_1755,"This is a little gem on the outskirts of Leslieville. My friend had been wanting to go here for months now, and miraculously there was parking outside....and free to boot! I'm sure it was well worth the wait and he won't be waiting long to go back, because the food was the kind of comforting Italian that you can just melt into. The menu is simple and concise (just the way I like them because I'm uber indecisive), with the usually antipasti, pizzas and pastas. After a long winded debate in my head, I decided on the beef cheek braised with onions and red wine over housemade pasta. My dinnermate had spaghetti and meatballs. I absolutely loved my beef cheeks, tender enough to break apart with a fork, but maintained meaty bite. I could taste every ingredient in the braise from the gently cooked onions to the luscious red wine. I didn't really want to share my dish, so I didn't dare ask for some spaghetti. But I hear it's as good an Italian sister-in-law....which sounds pretty good to me."
test_1756,"The Landmark Diner has been around for years and years for a reason...really good food at decent prices. They were even featured on diners- drive ins- and dives, yep it serves up a tasty dish.....usually. But just like any other establishment they can have an off day, but you had better not say anything while you are there. They have a reputation for not  handling critiziism very well. The last time our family ate there, my wife said that the chocolate cake was that great ( usually is ) ......mind you she just said  this to the waitress who asked if all was ok. The owner came to our table and really showed is butt off. Sadly this was not the first such experience but I can assure you it will be the last. We put up with their rudeness and poor service because the food was better than average for too long. If Guy fieri had not complimented that tool of an owner he would have been tepreated the same too."
test_1757,"Ahh another unique gem in Montreal! The location is fantastic and the food was super tasty.  The only downside would be that since it is relatively in the tourist area, the price might be steep.

Food: 4/5, I got the pate chinois au canard, which is simply Shepards pie with duck instead served with beets and homemade tomato ketchup. It was very good and but the main attraction of the meal was the giant cookie on a skillet with ice cream on top. I'd return next time just for the cookie.

Service: 4/5, our waitress was great, she came by often to check up on us and even though some of our friends took longer to decide, she was super patient.

Ambience: 5/5, amazing with live music and open concept feel. Even with all the noise around, it's great for conversations and comfortable seating.

Price: 2/5, around $40+ per person if you get a main dish, dessert and drinks.  The drinks and desserts were reasonably priced. The main dishes however are $20+ which is not exactly what you paid for.  

Highly recommended for patio-dessert-drinks type of night and perhaps skip a meal ;)"
test_1758,"It's pretty much every man for himself on arrival.  Waited at least 10 or 15 mins before waitress came over to take names.  If I hadn't shouted to her that we had been waiting, she'd have seated others who came in after us first.  They need a greeter on busy days to avoid chaos.  I ordered a crepe with fire roasted chicken and harissa.  If there was three ounces of chicken, i'd be surprised, more likely two.  I spent most of my meal thinking, well, there'll probably be some in the next bite. Don't get me wrong, the crepes are good, but prices are a bit high to be skimping.  Paid extra for avocado and literally got about a sixth of a small avocado.  Yes, Americans are spoiled on portion size, but this place needs to get a clue."
test_1759,"I've been going to see Jinia since moving to the East Valley in 2012. I found Flict through Yelp reviews, and I am SO glad I gave them a call. Absolutely the best staff and atmosphere out of any salon I have ever experienced. Everyone knows your name when you walk in the door, and you receive the best service every single visit. I am super picky when it comes to my hair, and it can be very finicky to style (thick, coarse, wavy), but I've never walked out with a cut I didn't LOVE!!!"
test_1760,"Very nice staff, from check in to check out! Cafeteria is great! We forgot my Dad's cane and the  gal that wheeled us down from the 8th floor was so kind to go all the way back and get it!! 

Nurses were all very kind to my Dad as well!"
test_1761,"Was sold a ""new"" battery for $95. I was told I had a three year warranty; 5 year limited warranty, because of buying new. I paid for the battery and was given only my credit card receipt. I asked about a warranty form and he said the sticker on my battery and information in the computer was all I needed.  After about three months, it started dying frequently. About six times in the span of 2 1/2 months. I took it to my mechanic and he said it was all juiced out. I also took it through valvoline, for a second opinion, same response. So I went to bulldog battery to fix the problem. I told my situation to the guy at the desk, he had me take my car into the garage. The guy in the garage said it was a used battery. They offered to sell me a new battery. No warranty, because the battery was used. Really crappy even for used. So instead of saving me 30 bucks, bulldog battery cost me $95, and a headache. I give zero stars 0!"
test_1762,Had a very nice dinner here with the family all of the food was great. We all got different cuts of beef and everyone was very pleased. While I was happy to see they had bourbon they butchered the old fashioned. Maybe I'm just a snob but an old fashioned should never have muddled fruit in it. It's an old simple drink of bitters sugar whiskey and an orange peel. But that was my fault for not reading the menu so the stars stay! Very friendly service as well!
test_1763,"This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed. 

Come for the food, but stay for the shakes.  If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town. 

The monthly food specials keep the menu interesting. 

The absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else. 

In short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron."
test_1764,Amazing hand crafted burritos. Everything made in house and full of great flavours. The rice or noodles option is a nice twist on a classic. Great price and well worth it.
test_1765,"Delicious, local and sexy...

Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. There really isn't a better word to describe this place. This restaurant has been on my list of places to try in Pittsburgh for a LONG time - and I finally got here! 

I went during the polar vortex (when it was about -7 degrees without the windchill), and they had $3.00 valet parking for Spoon and BRGR. Perfect. 

The waiters and waitresses were friendly and attentive - and they knew what they were talking about. There were so many delicious choices - but the staff had a way with words that helped me decide. 

I went for the Alaskan Black Cod and Crab Cakes with root veggies, potato risotto, brussels sprout leaves and beets - #yum. Oh! And the bread that they served from BreadWorks...melt in your mouth good. Their menu changes often as they support Western PA farmers by using fresh and local ingredients - always a big fan of establishments that abide by the 'Farm to Table' movement. 

The atmosphere was romantic - dark, quiet and calming. I didn't like that they sat us near the windows (a bit too much cold for the heavy curtains to keep out) - there weren't many other people dining due to the weather - so I would have thought that they would placed us a little more central in the restaurant, away from the cold windows... 

They had a high top table for about 8 (maybe more) near a fireplace close to the bar - not sure if they consider that to be a separate bar area different than the restaurant - but I thought how fun it would be for a group dinner - great cocktails and delicious food. 

I'll definitely be back."
test_1766,"Had the fish tacos! Best ever!! Yummy! Yummy!! Great food, great price, great service!!"
test_1767,"This place is like a little piece of Las Vegas history.  An older gentleman serenades you with the accordion and a song that is relevant to your table...he's adorable and talented.  You get FREE (really) house white wine and red wine with your meal, as well as a house salad or minestrone, and after your meal, you get ""cappuccino"" which is more like hot chocolate with whipped cream on top.  I didn't have very high expectations for this joint, as my father was born in Sicily, so I get the ""real deal"" at home.  But, I had the cannelloni - and it was pretty darn good!!  Came with a side of cheesy, creamed spinach.  My husband had Cioppino- which had half a lobster tail, chunks of salmon, mussels, and scallops - a big bowl of good seafood in a mildly spicy tomato broth.  And every table gets unlimited garlic cheese Italian bread.  Portions are huge- taste is good-service is spot on.  It's as close to the real deal for those prices as you will ever get!  And you are privileged to dine in a nostalgic place, where the west was once wild, albeit Italian.  That's Amore!!!"
test_1768,"I've been back here a few times, and seriously, I think it was a fluke that they did my eyebrows nicely the first time.  It was already shaped nicely to begin with, so it didn't even require that much effort.

The next few times when I let the eyebrows get bushier they made me look like my eyebrow was a line that thinned out at the end... what a disaster, and the worst part is that I never realize how bad it is until after I get home.  Why, oh why. 

They've also taken off the student discount sign."
test_1769,"Carne Asada tacos were good, pulled pork tacos were average. The atmosphere and location is great, fun place to hang out with friends. The house margarita wasn't sour enough, but the sangria was a solid choice."
test_1770,"Got Served the best burger I have ever had. Came here with a colleague with for lunch during a business trip to Vegas and me being me had to Yelp the best restaurants for lunch before picking a spot. Served came up top so we went with that. 

Upon entering the restaurant it was shocking. Place was absolutely deserted, literally no one. Shocked we still decided to sit down and give the spot a try. A very nice hostess came over and took out order and dropped off some spiced chips and salsa. From the chips and salsa both my colleague and I both knew this was going to be a special lunch. We both couldn't stop eating the chips they were that delicious. 

For entree my colleague ordered their club (against my advise) with sweet potato fries and I went with their BBQ Bacon Burger with potato wedges. His club was good but nothing special but my Burger my god was that delicious. Perfectly cooked, quality bacon, and on a solid bun. 

Overall, this has easily beat Midtown Eats in Reno for me (since they removed the Bison Burger off their menu) for my favorite burger. Delicious. Will be back!!"
test_1771,"This place is adorable. I came here in summer, and it was perfect - cool inside, fresh and cold water, great service, incredible food. I live a little too far away now to come back, but maybe when it's warm again I'll head back to Hochelaga..."
test_1772,"Since this location is brand spankin' new, you can expect that the floors are still sparkly clean, the seats have not yet been subjected by mysterious stains, and the interior design is modern and classy.

My only complaint is that it is really friggen cold in here! I know most movie theaters are well ventilated because let's be real, you're contained in a room with 200 odorous bodies for 2-3 hours at a time.. BUT this theater is just really chilly and I was already wearing a long sleeve."
test_1773,"Love this place. Awesome beer, always cold, unique taste. I have tried about 7 different beers here and everyone is great. I love to try all different kind of brewery's in Akron area (tried almost all of them) and this place is very hard to beat. Not to mention the place is huge, has a fun vibe to it; fun things to do there while your drinking. You must try this place out you won't be disappointed"
test_1774,Didn't expect much and was disappointed. Looking for and average Vegas buffet with some seafood treats. It was below average and the seafood was sub par even the frozen crab
test_1775,"Wow, what can I say without giving the show away?

I am aware of the Beatles and their contribution to pop culture, but was never a follower. The way they blend all generations through aerial acrobatics, costumes, props, and blend of musical hits is brilliant!

There's no bad seat in the house, we sat in section 207. Though we missed out on some of the interaction between the stage actors and props, we had a nice view of the entire integration of acts.

Everyone should go see this CDS show! We've been to Zumanity and Ka, and this is by far our favorite!"
test_1776,"I tried to take pictures on my cell Phone.   I was stopped by the security guard and told to delete them.  I will not be returning to this store.  Please be open and free.

test_1777,"I just went to this restaurant tonight and it was so incredible that I  ate and ate and ate and couldn't stop and now I want to die from fullness.

Incredible food. 10/10 would overeat here again."
test_1778,"If you are headed to a Golden Knights game and you want to chow down before hand, stop here for a great selection of foods and spirits.  Prompt, friendly service and a delicious reasonable priced meal for 3 of us including multiple apps and some drinks along w entrees.  Our waitress Tiffany was awesome and Erin wants to be friends with her.  Overwhelmingly pleasing experience."
test_1779,"Very nice park for a variety of activities including playground and amusement park for children, jogging, walking, golfing and just enjoying the great outdoors."
test_1780,"This place is awesome. All-you-can-eat sushi lunch for under $30, with delicacies like uni and ebi?? Yes please. Sushi was supremely fresh. I've eaten sushi at some of the best places on earth, and this stacks up among the best I've had state-side. I walked out stuffed and happy. Go here!"
test_1781,"I don't normally leave bad reviews, so when I do, it's warranted. I actually feel WORSE after having massage here. Seriously, I've never experienced that before. I mean, who feels worse after a massage!? Even my bf complained he was hurting afterwards,  but his pain went away. Mine seems to be getting worse, right between my shoulder blades. I'm NEVER going there again, I don't care how cheap it is. That's my fault for allowing someone with very little training touch my muscles"
test_1782,I'm in Madison for work and came across this place in July.  The coffee is great (love the house dark roast) and the grilled cheese sandwiches are worth every calorie!  I've tried at least 3 different versions and they were all fantastic!   The coffee here is as good if not better than the Intellgentsia coffee I pay considerably more for in Silver Lake.
test_1783,"Overall the items I had were ok.  The ribs were tender, the potato salad and Mac and cheese was great.  The baked beans tasted ok, but the texture was kinda strange.  Like it was maybe undercooked.  The muffin tops were also a little dry.  My biggest issue was the burnt ends and brisket.  I was disappointed to find chuck steak used instead of brisket meat.  Also no smoke ring to be found and the meat was dry.  Since they used chuck the burnt ends were basically just big chunks of chuck and not really burnt and not smoked.  I'm gonna hope that they ran out of brisket and baked or grilled a chuck roast in a pinch.  I'll give it another shot cause the ribs and sauces were good.  Ask before you order brisket!"
test_1784,"Had a reservation, restaurant was less than half full, and we waited an hour to only get one salad and waters. No waitress or food in sight."
test_1785,"I been going to jp since it open. Menu are great, will try breakfast one of these days if I wake up that early on the weekend. But rest of the menu are great and portion are great compare to price. Mac and cheese,fresh chilled are great, love onion rings,parmesan French fries, most sinful are late night menu of fried peanut butter and jolley and also fried twinkie too.trust me everything are good. Too many good things too lust"
test_1786,"We had to wait for over an hour for our food AFTER we were seated and put our order in.  The service was horrible and the food was luke warm at best when it was served to is.  Cute spot, horrible service."
test_1787,Had an amazing dinner here for the first night of EDC!! Michael was an amazing server. Definitely coming back!!!
test_1788,"Recently visited Hi-Rollers for the first time in September and am already planning on coming back (I live in Canada). I grew up in Las Vegas before moving to Toronto and wish this place was around throughout my childhood and teen years. 

I was lucky enough to have Martin (the owner) cut my hair, but by the looks of it, I can easily say that everyone who works there knows everything there is to know about hair and style. Anyone looking for a barbershop with great atmosphere, service, and people let Hi-Rollers be your first stop."
test_1789,"I didn't know about Local Breeze but a friend did and he wanted to take me there. On the day we went they were, sadly, closed. I say ""sadly"" because it caused us to lope on over to Cibo, which is right next door, where I was served a meager, poorly dressed salad with cold, tasteless chicken chunks. Well, we finally made our way back to Local Breeze and I got served the kind of salad a man wants to get served. I'd go so far as to say that this without question one of the best salads I've had in Phoenix. I had the ""chopped salad,"" overstuffed with greens, fire-roasted corn, olives, sun-dried peppers, feta and awesome. The oddly named ""white vinaigrette"" dressing was fabulous and more to the point: there was enough of it to satisfy me. But what set this salad apart was the optional ""blackened chicken,"" which, while not spicy enough to really suit me, was beautifully cooked with a distinctive charred flavor. I took a picture of this work of art, go check it out.

So why the three stars then? Because no salad is worth $16. Not even this one. Pita Jungle's large Greek salad, the baseline by which I judge all salads - with perfectly grilled chicken added - is $12. This place is a bit too pricey for what is being offered but that's only a minor sin when the food is this good. Also the service, while friendly, was somewhat negligent. The place was practically empty and we had to catch our server's attention on multiple occasions. Still, when I'm feeling like I've got some extra change in my pocket, I will definitely be back. I am anxious to try more."
test_1790,"Ryan G. is my dude. The restaurant is breathtakingly beautiful- from the hanging lights to the nice patio with music and fire pits. Thankfully Ryan is an intelligent guy and helped guide us through our meal as we were a little overwhelmed by all the choices. We ordered the Irish Blood & Honey and the Belvedere Blue to drink. Fritto Misto and bruschetta to start, followed by scallops and sea bass entrees. We were blown away by everything we ate, especially the seafood dishes. The depth of flavor was awesome. Ryan stopped to chat about our meals and told us how much he loves working in a from-scratch restaurant. We finished with the tres leches cake and left stuffed and amazed. 5 stars for decor, food, and amazing service. We are so excited to come back, and we'll request Ryan when we do."
test_1791,"It's been at least thirty years since I last went to a drive in, so when my friends suggested catching a movie here I thought they were a little crazy. But sure, I like a new experience and thought it might be worth a giggle. We caught the new Men In Black 3 movie.

I have to admit - this was an AWESOME idea. It turned out to be a whole lot of fun! The movie was easy to see and it was neat to be able to talk to folks during the movie without disturbing other patrons. Plus if you're a smoker, it's cool. And you can bring your dog! (What if your dog is a smoker? I'm not sure.)

A couple of tips...
- Check weather.com to see when the sun sets. The movie starts just after that.
- Arrive early. You will want to make sure you get a good spot.
- Bring lawn chairs! This can be more comfortable than sitting in the car.
- My Android phone has an FM radio receiver. The soundtrack is broadcast over a low power FM transmitter so I was able to use my headphones and not have to hear any of the other noises. Why don't ""normal"" movie theaters do this??
- The line for the concession stand gets long just before the movie starts. So if you're getting stuff, get it as soon as you arrive.

While it's super easy to smuggle in your own food and drink, it's not a nice thing to do. They have a concession stand here with the usual stuff - candy, popcorn, nachos, hot dogs, cotton candy - and the prices are surprisingly reasonable. The concession stand is what keeps the place open. If you're going to smuggle anything, bring your flask to make your ""Coke"" into something more adult. But buy the soda here!

Current price is $5 per person. They don't seem to be offering a ""per car"" price any more."
test_1792,"Just don't. Food was not very good and the price was high. The ""complementary"" beer and wine offset some of the disappointment. Next time I will hit up the burger place."
test_1793,"Enterprise this was a major summer trip from Phoenix to New York and the Dodge Caravan made it an awesome experience for my family. Love this location fantastic customer service and very friendly, caring. I picked up early with no issues and dropped off just as quick. Thanks again!!"
test_1794,Such a nice and beautiful apartment. I feel really safe here compared to my old apartment community. Maintenance issues are resolved in a timely manner. Office staff is competent. Love that it's right next to Vons and some restaurants. Neighbors are really friendly and quiet.
test_1795,After some of the bad reviews on trip advisor we were worried but it was fine.  Rooms are a bit dated compared to the ultra modern lobby but descent and clean.
test_1796,"Okay so i took my son for his 9th birthday breakfast on Saturday February 24th. We were very disappointed in the food. The place was busy but there was no wait for a table the entire time we were there so it wasn't that busy. My sons hash browns were way over cooked and his toast was burnt, i gave him my hashbrowns cause they were okay. My eggs were not over hard they were slimy on one side and my toast was dry as hell with no butter at all. I asked for butter and after waiting for quite awhile i got totally burnt toast. I asked again for new toast and as we were about to leave i got one piece of okay toast. I was excited to bring my son for his bday breakfast but we were both very disappointed by the crap coming out of the kitchen. Also it seems like the old waitresses don't understand the pads they use to take your order. Unfortunately we will not be back and will go back to our regular breakfast spots, this time was horrible and will keep us away for good....."
test_1797,They're always accomodating for daily drop offs and the teachers and staff and very nice and friendly.
test_1798,"Excellent dinner last night and doing a repeat tonight. CHILEAN SEA BASS AND MUSHROOM SIDE ORDER W BAKED POTATOE can't be beat! Waiter Richmod, one if the best ever...he remembered my entree! Highly recommend if in Vegas at the Rio!"
test_1799,"My daughter tipped me off to this place.  I'd been passing it for years.  I went in with my 1963 Mercury which had a stalling problem.  We popped the hood and one of the guys fixed the vacuum hose in 10 min.  No problem.  You get honest, hard work from these guys who are fair and have great prices.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
test_1800,Yummy!! I love this place! They have good fresh donuts! I love going to this shop on the weekend with my family.. The customer service is the best!!! My favorite donut is the fruity pebble
test_1801,"This place can easily be missed if you are driving by, but to be honest. its not worth missing...

I am glad i finally made my trek down 32nd st to shea. Cause this place is awesome. Nice ""quaint"" little sit down cafe. Perfect for studying, reading, or enjoying your post hike on any of the number of trails around here. They have a small food menu. Sandwiches are delicious btw. I am pretty sure the chips are homemade, they are not too salty which is perfect..i'd be okay with zero salt too. 

I had their tea, it was delicious. Also had a nutella hot chocolate, really wish it had more chocolate/nutella flavor. But otherwise it was awesomely delicious. I willllll be back. Especially when i need my cup of  coffee in the A.m."
test_1802,Man these guys are great. They have a good selection of sport or supersport bikes and also great prices. Go and see Kelly he's the man that help me get a zx10r very knowledgeable on the bikes there. He also makes you feel at home. So go to Kelly he's the man to see!!
test_1803,"After meeting Tyler, I felt very confident that his company would do a great job on our Arizona yard. My family and I are new to the area and wanted to hire a professional to care for our lawn. After Tyler handled the first couple appointments, a younger assistant started handling my property by himself. He sprayed our front ground covering with pesticides that caused the plant to begin to die. One could see exactly where the spray occurred and then the brown starting to emerge from that spot as the poison spread throughout the covering. He did this on our center island and on the entire covering on the right side of the house.

 I contacted Tyler to let him know what happened and he felt it would recover. The center island looked so bad because the entire covering had died, was beginning to grow mold underneath and was not as large as the right side so I decided to just take it out and cover the area with rocks and a new cactus. I sent Tyler pictures and asked that we not be charged for that month's services as our one ground covering had completely died and the right side was on its way. He agreed and, once again, said that if I left it alone, it would come back. I decided to leave the right side alone and give it a chance. There were still a few green buds so maybe? It didn't and I need to rip the entire right side up. 

Tyler contacted me saying that I still owed him $55 of the $110 of the months payment. I told him that we had agreed not to charge me that month as his assistant killed a significant amount of my landscaping. I sent pictures and he refused to budge. I reminded him that I am going to have to buy more plants, more rocks, and tear it all up. He still responded with 

""....please pay for the one service that is owed to our company.
Thank you,
Tyler Foutz
President""

My husband and I decided to just give him his money and walk away. It's not worth arguing over $55 but I am disappointed that there was never even an apology. Somehow, pesticides killing lawn is my fault. Oh well. Enclosing before and after pictures."
test_1804,"I've always been a big fan of this quaint little Bridgeland gem. The food is always very fresh and the service is always great, even when it's a busier lunch hour rush crowd. Lots of great menu items, although I always go for the Falafel, Beef Shwarma or Chicken Shish. The regular size is usually more than enough, especially since you usually *have* to get at least one of the many Baklava flavours they have by the cash register.

The Dolmades and Fatyers are super delicious as well. In the Summer, the little patio they have is great to hang out on, and right across the street is a good ice cream shop as well.

During Mo'Vember, I visited Tazza and the older gentlemen behind the counter liked my 'stache so much he made me a 'special' shwarma which was totally loaded and about the best one I've ever had there.

Thumbs up."
test_1805,"Everything it's great , lot of activities , good food , clean , and warm people"
test_1806,"This the best Mexican food I have had in the Carolinas. The freshly made avocado salsa is different and delicious. The service is friendly and present. It is worth a trip to Indian Land,SC."
test_1807,"Decided to check this place out, since it's close by RAW Fitness and Portion Control, which I go to regularly.   After standing directly in front of Reception and waiting patiently for no less than 10 minutes, I walked out.    Two other guests in front of me received full on attention.    I was not even acknowledged with a greeting.   I did not have an appt, but the door stated they take walk ins.    Disappointing."
test_1808,"Now this was a pleasant surprise. I must have walked passed this place 1000 times and never really got what it was. They changed their sign, stated what they do, and I went in. Very pleased with this discovery. I liked the food. I liked the service. I loved the retro diner look. i LIKE it!"
test_1809,I stumbled across this restaurant while driving around my neighborhood. I have since invited anyone I can. The tacos are amazing. Simple and impeccably executed. You can't go wrong here.
test_1810,"Very cool place. My sandwhich was DELICIOUS!! A big selection, helpful staff, and fun atmosphere make this a place worth coming to. Settled in Acorn Alley, amongst other cool shops and bars, adds to the fun."
test_1811,"A relatively clean McDonald's, but there is just something about it that never seems quite right.  Perhaps it is the fact that this one is right across the street from Case Western Reserve University, yet on the few times I have gone in, I have never seen any college students.  Very strange, and maybe I am just not going at the right time.

The fries were overdone today, which is a big McD's no-no."
test_1812,"Horrible staff , walked past few times with out saying anything had to bring it to her attention we were waiting over 10min to order didn't apologize say sorry or anything"
test_1813,"So here is the deal with Chipotle.  Every once in a while I forget why I don't like coming here and then *poof*. I magically find myself in line, looking at that damned Aztec art thingy, wondering what a plywood and sheet metal Montezuma has to do with the comically overstuffed burrito I am doomed to regret eating.  
The food does not taste horrible.  It is decent.  I really enjoy their fountain soda, I don't know why.  Their are a few places that just have amazing fountain soda.  QT for one and Chipotle for two.  (That reminds me, I am going to yelp QT next.  I have some shit to say about those Mo-Fo's.)

So here is why Chipotle gets two stars. Every time I eat there, I get about halfway through my giant tube filled with meat, beans, and rice when Ol' buzz kill Chipotle shows up in my gut, like the cops coming to a party.  Chipotle barges in and yells ""Chipotles here, everybody OUT!"".  That is when all of the drunken teenagers inside me make haste for the nearest exit. 

Yes, I did just make a diarrhea euphemism, relating Chipotle to the cops and my poop to drunken teenagers.  I am not proud.

Why do I repeatedly torture myself for mediocre food?

Although, I do expect mad props for not going with a Montezuma's Revenge joke."
test_1814,"Hot Taco's overall rating on Yelp is pretty low, which I think is unfortunate. Personally, I've had several positive experiences there. Now, don't get me wrong... it's not outstanding by any means, but still, I'd say it's good and we go pretty regularly on Tuesdays. This is probably my favorite part about this place... Taco Tuesdays. All their tacos are $2 each, and they have a Mexican beer that is $2 as well as $2 margaritas (smaller than normal but still a decent size). Dinner (and drinks?!) for $8? I'll be there. 

Other things that I like - they recently added a salsa bar with 6 or 7 different types of salsa. It's got a really great avocado salsa, plus some others that aren't necessarily unique but still, variety is good and I think this new addition really kicks the whole place up a notch. Also, tacos can be served on corn, flour, or lettuce wraps. I personally go for the lettuce and I haven't seen many other places around town offer that as an option.   

Cons - service can be a little slow and parking there on the weekends can be tricky sometimes. But, overall, a good spot."
test_1815,"This was actually my very first Vegas show, I can't believe it took me this long to finally see one.  I ordered the tickets on-line, they were having a special, buy one get one free, so I couldn't pass it up.  I had been wanting to see it for a while.  I ordered the tickets so far in advance that we were sitting third row center!

The show was great, especially the music.  I was a little disappointed with the set though, some of the scenes could have had better props.  The songs meshed well with the story line, and I really enjoyed the costumes.  This musical makes you want to jump up and start dancing in the aisles, especially the song at the end."
test_1816,Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back
test_1817,"*Red flag when the pharmacy technician confuses acetaminophen for psudoephedrine. 
So dropped off a prescription at 2pm on Thursday was told 1 hour. Went back at 5:30 and was told that the prescription was written wrong and that they need to get a hold of our doctor but since it was after 5 there was nobody in the doctor's office. Why they waited until 5:30 to call is frustrating as well as not calling me to let me know. Now it's Friday 1:45 p.m. and they still have not contacted the doctor and im On my way out of town without my daughter's meds."
test_1818,Great little cafe! The food is amazing and they have some unique dishes on their breakfast menu. The lox scramble is my favorite! The staff is very friendly and down to earth and Norm is such a genuine guy! I stop in for lunch every now and then when I feel like I need some comfort food. There is something on the menu for everyone. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food at good prices!
test_1819,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I've been coming year for years, even with my mom as a minor. My first visit I came here and got a double nose piercing. My piercer was extremely knowledgeable and quick. Later on Nicola did my septum and let me tell you it was my least painful piercing. My septum healed so well and the placement is perfect. My daith piercing was perfectly placed and pierced too. The last time I came in was on my 18th birthday to get my nipples pierced. Jd made the process really comfortable and it hurt way less than expected. Really on top of of their store and who they hire. Clean too."
test_1820,"This place treats the patrons as if they're a product in a production line. The food is already prepared and plated (think airline food) and is brought out seconds after ordering. All the food is moved from table to table on carts, and when you order they pull a plate off the cart and serve you. They're simply trying to move as many people through as possible. We thought we'd have a nice, relaxing, long Italian meal with family and friends but after less than 45 minutes the waiter asked if we could leave because they needed the table for another party. Unreal. Half of our party wasn't even finished with their meal. For a bill in excess of $300 we should've at least been afforded the opportunity to order dessert or finish our wine. 
It's super expensive. No dish cheaper than $23...and that was for simple spaghetti. The better dishes are $35 and up. 
It's designed to push as many patrons through as they can. Unfriendly. Unwelcoming. Expensive. Not Italian. Don't go."
test_1821,"Taco Time?  Not for me!  I'm just not seeing this 5 star rating, even though with only 10 reviews it's still in the kindergarten stages of reviews!

I was extremely eager to try this taco joint on my way out of the Charlotte area.  Located in a strip building on a busy street in the Concord area, you can't miss the flaming red/yellow Taco Time lettering!

It's kinda set up like a Chipotle in that there's a bar in front of you for additional toppings for the tacos or burritos of your choice.  The burritos are large, stuffed full of good tasting toppings, but unless you get the carnitas as your meat you'll be disappointed!  The carnitas are really tasty, but one clarification, it's stewed pork, not deep fried pork!
The tacos are decent in size, large if you really lay the toppings on, but the steak and pork are so bland that you'll wonder what did I just eat?  The corn tortillas are fabulous, quite possibly homemade, and the steak pieces are raw and thrown on the grill upon ordering!  Problem is, they must add no seasoning once it's on the grill or marinate the meat beforehand?

Lots of potential at Taco Time, but at this point in time, they're just missing the mark!"
test_1822,"The place is nice, good atmosphere, service however was not great. I took my old school love out to dined. I ordered appetizer and entrees and the server did not offer me the option of if the appetizers get served first or together with the entree. Upon ordering my drink, the server was not very friendly, in fact, she was very rushed in taking the order. Food is OK, I was referred to this place by a friend who claimed that this place has the ""best grilled cheese"", I would like to confirm that this statement is a myth (false). As for the grill cheese, the bread was way too think, and I would preferred it to be more toasted, as the cheese did not melt. In the conclusion, the place is good if you want to impress your sweetheart by taking her to a place that has good atmosphere and looks nice however, if you are a food lover... stay away... I will not be returning... peace."
test_1823,"Mojitos were on special the day we decide to have lunch here, so we were given a sample as we were brought to our table. SCORE!

As I looked over the menu, I was kind of disappointed it had changed. My favourite go to (Dungeness crab and asparagus) was no longer available. Ugh. So I went with the Chicken and Mushroom fettuccini since I had a hankering for pasta. My gf went with a soup and salad.

Our food was ok, not bad but not stellar. Our server seemed new but he was really attentive, as was the manager (he also checked up on diners as well). Since neither of us wanted to head back to work right away, so it wasn't hard to convince us to get dessert (a summer berry crumble).  While we were settling the bill, a chef came by and offered us some fresh baked cookies - YES PLEASE!

I can't say I love Earl's, but I can see why some people do. What they lack in food, they make up for in the inviting atmosphere and staff."
test_1824,"Probably my favorite bar... catch me here like everyday!

I wish I could try everything on the menu but I only have like a top 10 favorites of what I reorder each time I get food. Their bloody mary's and drinks are off the hook. Super strong, and cheap, just the way I like them. Their happy hour is also great if I ever make it on time. I definitely totally vouch for their food. It isn't greasy nasty bar food.... it actually is quality and reasonably priced. 

Sitting at a table is a bit of a hassle because the 2000 britney spears & justin timberlake denim-blingy belt wearing waitresses take FOREVER, have a bad attitude always (not one is friendly to me the 3 years I've been coming here), and ignore me. I recommend sitting at the bar for the best service. The bar tenders are always a great time. They make sure my thirst is quenched, give me water whenever I've had one too many, and comp my drinks whenever I gamble. I SWEAR I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. It is a hit or miss but I usually break even or win 40$ on Keno. 

I love you Sierra Gold! Thank you for making me poor."
test_1825,"A great place to get the staples like onions, avocados, beans, rice, fruit, bread, oil, etc. Usually same quality as full-blown grocery stores, but I find the prices a bit lower.  The produce (i.e., lettuce, cilantro, broccoli, etc.)can sometimes look a little limp, so I usually go elsewhere for these. They do have great sales once in a while, with pineapple and melons and such for only a buck or two."
test_1826,"Not a bad place. This is one of my first stops here in toronto and it served the city well.  I'm not a huge burrito fan, but this place pretty much won me over and that says a lot.

Service is okay, the cashier was indifferent and non-chalant. Quiet Sunday? Beats me.  I ordered the steak burrito and absolutely loved the chewy texture of the steak.  

Will probably try out the halibut burrito next."
test_1827,"Stopped by after playing Top Golf, as it was just around the corner.
There was a small group of us (5) and we all tasted different beers.
I had the K-LAX IPA and I must say it was pretty nice.
Other beers that flowed were the 'SUH DUDE, CHILL-LAX WITH CHERRIES, MIJO (which got the thumbs down from us all - not a flavorful beer - just was missing something), BLAP! BLAP! and another I can't remember.
Overall, this is a great place to stop by have a different experience. The beers are good, the waitresses are really nice and I wish the pizza place opposite (in the communal area) was open beyond 10pm.. Pizza and beer is always a good mix.."
test_1828,"Went to the ""Thanksgiving Buffet"" today. It was horrible. the ""prime rib"" was extremely fatty. The ""turkey breast"" was dry and the ""ham"" , I think it was ham looked liked spam. The side dishes were not hot at all. The only thing I liked was the server and the unlimited coffee and ice tea. They also had breakfast items that looked terribly tired. The bacon was swimming in grease. Never again will I eat there and I feel liked my family were totally deceived with the promise of a ""Thanksgiving Buffet""."
test_1829,Good food we go once a week close to the best in the valley! Really good beef pho also the lemon grass chicken is awesome!!
test_1830,Probably one of the most unique spa experiences I've had. I had the one hour reflexology (whole body) plus shampoo. The head massage is fantastic! Ask for Jenny -- she does a great job!
test_1831,"I planned a baby shower at KD Party center and let me just say I was extremely pleased. The hall itself was very nice, clean and very spacious. Not only that the communication throughout my planning was very professional. She kept me updated and informed all the way until the day of the shower.  If you are planning any type of even I would recommend KD Party Center!!!!!!"
test_1832,"If you ever get into a lusty bedroom brawl and [he destroys] your leather hand bag ends up in shreds have no fear- Gary at Green Valley Shoe will make it as good as new! I brought in my favorite designer leather hand bag a few days ago- when I dropped it off- the bag looked so sad :''( . It was tattered almost in two! With the handle broken in half I was sure it was pointless to even try to fix the damage that had been done. The leather  shoulder strap was also ripped from the body of the purse :( I was not hopeful [at all] on what could be done to repair my once favorite day-to-day purse. 
   To my delight, when I came back to pick up my bag a few days later, Gary handed me what looked like a brand new bag! Shiny and new, as it had ever been. It was amazing, I was so grateful! Even having known where the defects had been, I  would have no idea where to look for any sign of damage on the purse now. I am so pleased with the craftsmanship this family owned business. Not only did the  leather look brand new again, but the cost to fix  it with Gary did not brake the bank for me either :). I felt the price was more than reasonable and only took a few days inside the store before it was returned to me, with a warm smile. 
That was my most recent item Green Valley Shoe Repair & Luggage 2 brought back from the dead...

Originally, I just needed the nearest leather and shoe repair business to where I live. This location is so convenient,  right on Rainbow and Robindale tucked away in a little strip mall area in with Oyshi Sushi and DQ ice cream. It's convenient location  and the always warm welcome(s) definitely help me gladly continue to bring my business there as well as promote this store to all my friends in the market to repair a shoe or buy anything that relates to leather-stretcher, polish, buffers, insoles- normal items but he always has a very nice selection to offer every costumer. In-fact, he also carries an assortment of classy looking women's and men's wallets, purses, a small assortment of nice quality luggage and some trendy sparkly rhinestone leather belts for ladies.  Green Valley Shoe Repair & Luggage 2,  goes above and beyond just repairs, carrying all heel heights and sizes of  the standard dance / classic  dance shoes. If you're in the market for dance shoes (work as a showgirl, dancer, etc.) this is a gem in southwest Las Vegas & you might be surprised by the selection GVSR has to offer. 

   Bringing in items that needed repair  and the quick turn around back to me made my decision to give Gary all my business an obvious one. I recommend this shoe repair to everyone in Las Vegas. I always feel he will be fair and honest and you can trust your things are in good hands here. If Gary feels  he can not fix the problem with what you bring to him he will tell you before he wastes any ones time... this has never happened to me, however I did witness him tell a couple that he did not want to make a LV bag worse (due to the process he would use to remove the stain on the bag- whatever it was-).  He told them he was concerned that he would be wasting their money and his time, he told them clearly he could not accept the item for repair and they went on their way. 
   **I have never had anything he could not fix. I've ALWAYS been able to have all repairs done with no problems: my favorite shoes, expensive leather products [including all my hand bags], and also the synthetic leather goods I bring to him. He fixes the defect and has my things coming back to me always looking above satisfactory level [and I am picky.]
   My black stilettos,  that had begun making a clicking noise (from the plastic piece at heel bottom having gone missing) -he fixes a problem like that for pennies on the dollar of what it would cost to by myself a new pair of heels. It was a relatively easy fix  for him but from the way Gary greets his costumers and the way he runs his business have helped him earn my trust . It was after a few small repairs like this one with him always having them ready for me the next business day that I felt comfortable to bring in all my in-need items stashed away in my closet.
     I like that it's a family business and that he remembers me when I stop in. His whole family is very personable,  as soon as they see you they are quick and attentive and make you feel as though they are there to help you. You get quality service at fair prices and quick turn around time. Many of the items I have since brought to Gary are irreplaceable to me and some have been busted and 'broken' for years because I just did not know who would be able to fix a problem like the ones I'd had with the bags shoes etc. in my closet. I'm happy to share this fine business on Yelp! and hope that others can enjoy having great things look their best again because of the skill and professionalism this store offers.  

Much appreciation to Gary!! TY 
xx"
test_1833,"Had a buy 1 get 1 here - wine/beer is free.  Food was amazingly great, again, another coke machine but I made ado.  The prime rib was out of this world!  Would def. come back again."
test_1834,Staff is always friendly.  And you can't beat the price.  My daughter has a low Rx and we have no glasses coverage on our insurance.  $39 out the door.  Can't beat that.  She's been very happy with her glasses.
test_1835,"Can we say eyebrow haters?!?!?!  I've been going to this location for awhile now and the lady with the short hair (she's never introduced herself or made me want to know her name) has threaded my eyebrows to near extinction!  I've asked her more than once to leave them thick and she seems to forget the next time and goes nuts!  Maybe if I learned the word ""thick"" in  her language she would remember.  Will not repeat."
test_1836,"I went here with some of the guys last year and we were looking for some 'serious' toned and slender meat.  I encouraged the guys to try this place in the Palms Hotel after hearing about it from some other friends.

The decor is modern as the restaurant is cast in a slighter darker environment with blue hues coming from the ceiling to give it a nice effect.

Our main dish between five guys was 2 Ribeyes that were 40 oz each.....  OMG.... the meat was prepared 'perfectly' in my opinion and each bite was so tender and flavorful with its' pepper-seared taste.

I had a lobster bisque before dinner that was perfect in its own manner, but, thinking back, I probably didn't need to order it as I was severely stuffed from eating all that steak.

Nice time I'm in Vegas, I'm coming back for another visit and bringing a nice bottle of Red to enjoy with dinner.... 

I recommend fully... and then some."
test_1837,"This is by far the best place to shop for and purchase firearms and supplies in the valley.  Fortunately, they are only about 20 minutes from where I live, but it is always worth the drive. The staff is knowledgeable, and willing to help without any high pressure sales.  

I recently purchased a new Sig Sauer from Spartan Arms...and was having a difficult time field stripping it.  They took the time to show me and to make sure I knew how before I left.  Spartan Arms also offers many classes from live fire, to safety.  I wouldn't shop anywhere else."
test_1838,"Starting out with the positives, I loved the fish choices, and enjoyed the puffy bread, pastas, the ribs and the lamb. They have fresh grapefruit juice! The dessert area was overwhelming but the cheesecake, bread pudding, and creme brulee were the best.

But in the end, I was really disappointed! All the beef I had was super undercooked, flat-out raw in the middle. The creme brulee wasn't fully cooked or crunchy on the top even though it tasted right. Everything was just kinda alright, and nothing very creative at all. We were gonna try Wynn the next day but after this we were wary too and instead had a fabulous brunch at Bouchon instead!"
test_1839,Hard to find and very small but would go back many times. Great pizza and very friendly staff. Snug and cozy works well at this wonderful find.
test_1840,"With a great jazz band playing on the Cumberland Street stage, a beautiful June evening, and the perfect table on the Dimmi patio, what else could one ask for? Oh! The food. Right. Well...

It was delicious! Both the Siciliana pizza (hard to find in Toronto) and the rigatoni a la vodka were plentiful, piping hot, and very tasty.

We ended the meal with cafe americano and tiramisu, one of the best I've had, Italy included.

Service was fast and very friendly. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to my next visit."
test_1841,"Walked in as a drop-in, walked out a huge fan. And with dubs for the first time! Great location, great space, and great team. Was travelling for work and Coach Rob made me feel right at home. I mean who invites a stranger in and lets them sweat all over their stuff? Loved my visit and hope to get back."
test_1842,This has been on my list for quite sometime and it finally worked out that I was in the area for lunch. Didn't quite see anything on the buffet I wanted so I ordered from the menu. I got 3 Maki rolls and 2 yakitori  skewers. The sushi was very fresh and the spicy tuna roll was unique. Instead of the typical spicy mayo it had a some what bbq sauce with a nice heat to it. Different but not bad in any way. The bacon wrapped scallop yakitori is damn good. Will most definitely come back in the future.
test_1843,"Love this place. Definitely top 3 foodie spots in Vegas! Great dishes, fresh fish, great music, friendly atmosphere, and love the sushi chefs creativity! If you haven't made it here, GO! Happy hours are awesome here. I am a regular as long as I live in Vegas."
test_1844,Such a cute little place to get a great pastrami sandwich. Always welcoming staff never once had a problem here
test_1845,This place is really great for a smaller shop! Their staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable about their products. They have the best edibles there and always have a fair price. I would definitely tell my friends about it!
test_1846,"I met Lori at a conference a few years ago and started referring her clients. Lori and her team are experts in the Las Vegas market and provide the highest level of service. Every time I refer a client, I am kept up to date on the progress. If you're a buyer or seller considering to hire an agent, look no further, Lori and her business partner David Lamar will only exceed your expectations. The Las Vegas Agents!"
test_1847,"We did brunch buffet here and it was truly delicious. So much variety. I most enjoyed the prime rib, chow mein, and carrot cake. Worth the money."
test_1848,"It's a gas station. 

But it has a car wash. For my lazy ass who doesn't want to wash my car by hand, I like stations like this and there's one near my parent's place. Which means, when I visit, I can fill up and wash the bug guts and dust off my ride. 

As for the convenience store, I wouldn't know. I haven't set foot in there in all the years this place has been around. 

I fill up. Drive thru the wash. And leave."
test_1849,"My wife and I come here pretty often, me because of the best oatmeal in town and my wife loves their frittata. This time we brought our very good friends from Australia. A couple with their son. Peter, the husband is known for giving hard time waitresses any place he goes to and loves to costumize his orders. Cassandra, our waitress was awesome. Not only she took his most complicated order ever without any hesitation but made sure it was brought to the table promptly with smile and everything was perfect. I was very pleased and proud of this place and our friends were very impressed. They loved the bread, the food, the overall atmosphere and the friendly service."
test_1850,From the moment you enter the office you know you are in good hands. The entire staff is extremely professional and knowledgeable. They greet you with a smile and are happy to answer any questions you might have.  Dr. Daccache immediately calmed my nerves by thoroughly explaining my procedure beforehand. My procedure was painless and I was very comfortable the whole time because he and his assistant would continuously ask if I was ok. After the procedure they explained my post- op instructions and I was on my way. The entire experience was pain and problem free. I highly recommend this office!

test_1852,"I do not know how I should start to revile this hotel. I'll try to be as unbiased as I can. 

First off, my dad has made a reservation on booking before he let me know. In spite of lack knowledge, I did not intend to google this hotel.  This hotel is located in downtown  that's only thing that I could say as a positive about this hotel. 

There's no bell boy to pick your lovage up to upstairs, you gotta carry them to your room, which pretty uncomfortable particularly you have heavy and lots luggages. Thankfully hotel has its own closed park area, however it is not available by escalators, you gotta climb stairs and go outside, thereafter you'll enter hotel. That's pretty uncomfortable in winter time though distance is short.

Hotel has free wifi that's true, probably they won't mention pace internet, which is really so poor. Rooms are not clear enough. I'd not even suggest this hotel to my enemy. Stay away from it, before you regret it like me...."
test_1853,"Wow! Amazing. My grandmother was a war-bride from Wales in WWII, relocated to the back woods of Alabama in the 40s/50s. She learned how to make the BEST fried chicken, the BEST skillet cornbread, blackeyed peas, collard greens, etc....   

This place reminds me of my beloved grandma's table... God rest her soul. 

They just need some sort of beans regularly on the menu.  There were  ALWAYS beans on the table. Lol...

Fantastic service, excellent food, great cocktails, even crafted old school, off menu cocktails. They nailed it.

Peach cobbler, off the hook. Expensive, but worth it.

I can't wait to try the Beverly Center location."
test_1854,"Used this company many times, factory certified for most brands.
Never have to wait more than a day for service call, friendly, affordable,
and very knowledgeable technicians. And very flexible on appointment times.
A must use in the Charlotte and surrounding area !"
test_1855,"I thought my gorgeous YSL shoes were ruined for good when I ripped the leather on both of the heels. I took them to Kaner's and in 2-3 days they were good as new and it cost less than $15!

I AM SO HAPPY! Thank you you Kaner's!"
test_1856,Not worth it even if it is a cheaper flight. Worst flying experience of my life. Flight delayed hours and issues at takeoff.
test_1857,Great Mexican food. The al pastor and al carbon are excellent. I would go there all the time for the food but the ordering system always confuses me. With no standard menu and no system in place to direct you where to go it's a little confusing of you're not used to it. But the food is worth the wait/confusion.
test_1858,"I came from California to Vegas for vacation and decided to stop by Plan9piercing with the intention of getting my upper cartilage pierced; but I walked out with two cartilage piercings! Kelly helped me and he was super nice and patient, helping me with which studs to pick out and where to place them on my ear to ensure the best fit and look. I also really appreciate how the service was super quick! Depending on the earring you choose, prices start at $40 per piercing.

If you are in the area and would like to get your ears pierced, definitely come here because you won't find a better deal and service elsewhere! The next time I'm back in Vegas, this will be my go to spot. Thanks Kelly!"
test_1859,"Terrible experience! Their technician literally ruined my home when the ceiling came down from a leak in the attic that he refused to check and repair. They also refused to refund my money, this company has zero integrity!  Will be reporting this to the BBB. After reading this comment below from Tonya, it sounds like Penguin is grasping for straws. Pictures don't lie and typing up a book of excuses  doesn't help their company look any more honest. They have several bad reviews and I wish I would have read them before I used this sleazy company.Terrible experience!

I make sure I come here about once a week. 
Service is great, the gals upfront are always pleasant. Make sure you always ask for Raul. He's one of the best servers there.

Top Pick : Original Breakfast Burrito with Potatoes.
Make sure to check in and get a Banana Nut Muffin"
test_1861,I wish I could give 0 stars. The employees here are disrespectful. The lady doing nail my said the color I chose was ugly... Well good thing they aren't her nails! And the lady I spoke to because I was unhappy with this disrespectful comment. Didn't even care enough to say I will speak to her or anything worst customer service ever! Oh yeah it's my birthday!
test_1862,"Chou's kitchen is a nice little Chinese restaurant that specializes in food from the Dong bei or north eastern part of China. The foods are generally things like dumplings, the beef/pork pie, spicy lamb skewers, green onion pancakes, sour cabbage soup and many other foods that are similar to the items listed above. 

Must orders: lamb skewers and either the beef or pork pie
Highly recommended: green onion pancakes, pan fried chive dumpling, dumplings/pot stickers, Xiao long bao, sour cabbage soup

Most of my recommendations are appetizer sized so order one or order a few! The meat pies come in 3's"
test_1863,"If your entertainment in Vegas is solely reliant on what street-level shows you'll get to see for free, the Bellagio fountains are universally considered the best. 

Seeing a few hundred people practically camping by the railing to watch the fountain show felt similar to Disneyland Resort goers setting out blankets and waiting hours on end for Fantasmic or World of Color to start. It gets really crowded. 

The Bellagio's fountains attraction has cachet with their seemingly simple shows of light and water set to music. It's certainly better than waiting for the ""volcano"" at The Mirage to erupt, the destruction of Pompeii in the Forum Shops attached to Caesar's Palace, or to see the recorded porn-level acting with random dancing in Treasure Island's pirate show. You could argue the Venetian's Streetmosphere has the class, but it's not to the scale of the fountains. 

It's enjoyable no matter what language you speak or how much you've got in your wallet."
test_1864,"Fusion?  I don't think so.
Its a Pan-Asian - Pacific Rim place...

Is it the best thai?...no but its good
Is it the best chinese?...no but its good
is it the best vietnamese?...no but its ok
Is it the best sushi?...no but its ok

it has nice decor, above average food, great selection, typical asian service standards.

its good if your party can't decide on any specific type of asian cuisine"
test_1865,"I am suffering with chronic pain in my upper back, neck and part of my face.  I went to different Doctors and no one has helped me the way Dr. Peter has helped me.

I highly recommend him and thank him for being such a dedicated Dr.
Thank you Dr. Peter

test_1866,"For the price you really cannot beat the ""big John"" which is a roast beef sandwich on white  with chips and a drink. Don't forget to add the hot peppers and the oil & vinegar combo  or else you're just getting lettuce, Mayo and tomato as standard dress. The only complaint is the fact that Cheese is something you must request and have added after the fact, which i learned on my first go around when my order came sans cheese. 
Other than that everything else is A-OK and do yourself a favor and get some Sea salt and vinegar chips. Your taste buds will love you for it."
test_1867,The ice cream was so delicious. Strawberry banana was amazing. Salted caramel is so yummy
test_1868,"I'm so shamelessly obsessed with this place. Been to both Miami location & Vegas locations and they are both top notch delicious.  If you are in between Sushisamba and something else, just choose SS and you won't be sorry.  Solid must have recommendations are: rock shrimp tempura, samba roll spicy tuna(our server called it spicy tuna on crack and he was spot on), sea bass skewers, king crab sushi roll, yellowtail himachi(was over some kind of lemongrass delicousness), then finish off with the chocolate banana cake.  Each item was heavenly."
test_1869,We come to this location at least twice a week. We love the fresh food and quick service. Never been disappointed. Don't eat the cookies unless you want to be hooked!
test_1870,Ordered the fried ravioli and the Italian stallion pizza. I know I picked a great place when my boyfriends eyes rolled into the back of his head lol. Amazing food! Coming back again for sure
test_1871,"I called in a Take-Out order about 20 minutes before they closed.  I ordered curry chicken and when I got it home, about half way through eating it I noticed there was NO chicken.  Are you serious?  How does that happen?  I was hoping some of the potato clumps might actually be chicken, but no such luck.  The curry sauce tasted like it was made from a powder base that wasn't dissolved very well.  I ended up throwing away the second half.  First and last adventure with Tao."
test_1872,"Deja, Stephen and Karan MADE OUR NIGHT!!! Thank you to the wonderful staff at Postino for making our Tuesday night a lot more eventful! Awesome service from the front desk to the entire staff. Love the new tomato jelly! Thanks everyone for a great experience :)"
test_1873,"100x better than LVPO North.  Love the newer stores they opened outdoors.  I got tons of things on sale here.  Also, I can walk around outside without walking through one huge second hand smoke cloud.  Would most definitely return! :)"
test_1874,"Don't order sushi.  My hubby got food poisoned after eating their sashimi. When we mentioned to them that the fish did not taste fresh, they didn't do anything to replace the order. I don't think we will go back there anytime soon."
test_1875,"Being Korean I was so excited that a Korean restaurant was opening here in Southshore. We went to this restaurant once since the opening but now the waiting line is way too long! Until 8:30 pm at least. It's impossible for us to dine there anymore  when we would go at least once a week. The food was good, Too bad. I guess We need to give them time to organize them selves since they only just opened."
test_1876,Cool place! This used to be Johnny Rockets! Now it's called JR's Burgers. They have a very simple menu and the burgers here are delicious!
test_1877,Overall my experience was very good the salesmen are not pushy and I got a good price for a great safe and they honored everything they said and made any problem that I had right. The only reason it isn't five-star is because there was some minor damage on the safe that was not on the showroom floor prior to delivery. It was just inside the door frame so I touched up with paint and no big deal.
test_1878,"The food is somewhere between ok and good, so I rounded up to 4 stars due to the friendly service at the register.  I had the spicy avocado and lime kale and grain bowl.  As with other raw kale dishes, chewing the kale was a tiring experience.  There was a lot of it and it is not the easiest thing to chew.  I guess I wasn't expecting it to be salad-like, but it had good flavor.  I also sampled the strawberry banana smoothie, which tasted as expected.  Tried the baked french fries as well.  Eh, I guess this is why people don't bake them.  Overall it is a perfectly fine lunch stop."
test_1879,"Ordered delivery because the Sharks, Spurs, and Warriors were all playing on the same night and I wasn't about to go to a sports bar and reek of cigarette smoke or miss action while driving. Yelp app made it easy, Googled for an Eat24 discount code to offset the delivery fee. Order was delivered within an hour, food was decent enough that I'm keeping them in mind for a dine-in visit with hopes of rounding review up higher.

DUCK SALAD: Get it, this was our best dish. I'm hoping the dine-in version is a bit larger, but the protein portion was large. I'd dump this over a plate of spinach to make it go a bit further though. Dressing was delicious, a bit on the spicy side but great.
CRAB FRIED RICE: BF's go-to takeout order. This was priced pretty fairly at $13, and there was visible crab but it didn't really have too much of a crab flavor. Portion was slightly smaller than similarly-priced takeout orders from other places.
TOM KHA SOUP: Ordered this with tofu and there was tons, like the whole package. There were also tons of mushrooms. Unfortunately, the broth didn't have a developed flavor. Found tons of lemongrass and ginger in the bottom, so it wasn't for lack of seasoning, but it tasted plain.

Delivery gal was friendly. Order was correct, complete with extra requested hot sauce. They have lunch specials under $10, might have to check those out if I can't resist the duck salad again."
test_1880,"I think Blaze Pizza is better.  They have more choices for toppings and more sauces to choose from.  Still hard to find good pizza in Vegas, being from New York and all."
test_1881,"We have came here a few times to help my fianc√© find solutions to  his Keratoconus. Couldn't be happier with Dr. Doubrava although at times we felt the front house receptionist weren't the most friendliest girls out there.

After reaching out to them for a referral on hard lenses I was extremely pleased with the receptionist that was helping us over the phone. She had somewhat of an accent and we can't quit remember her name. She was more than helpful. Finally after a few phone calls here and there I received a call earlier today by another receptionist who made me feel like I never wanted to contact their offices again. After telling me the number to a referral she sounded like she was already having a bad day and to end our conversation I thanked her for her assistance and her response was ok and hung up. When someone thanks you a simple your welcome! Or have a nice day wouldn't hurt! She does not belong in that office not with an attitude like that."
test_1882,"Excellent food, very clean place with efficient service. Staff is very friendly and above all food is exceptional. Had tired Somoli food long time back but this is by far the best I have had. Roasted goat with rice and lamb chops are must try !!"
test_1883,Love Zarras!  The atmosphere is really fun. Not to be taken too seriously. Judy the chef makes everything from scratch. It is good home Italian cooking!   Have been here many times and always had a great meal!!
test_1884,Great times in this bar.  Awesome prices.  Friendly service and awesome security on the weekends.  All in all a great place to hang out!
test_1885,"Be aware!! Urgent Care billing as ER visits.  Our daughter had a minor dermatology issue, we checked at the desk and were charged and paid $150.  A month later received a $1800 bill, this is almost medical billing fraud."
test_1886,"Okay, I tried Cafe Hollander after their soft opening, once for breakfast during the week and today for brunch. I am eager to try them for lunch and dinner. Breakfast during the week went perfectly, Sunday brunch, not so much (for me.)

The breakfast menu is eclectic and fun. If you don't feel like a lot of food, you can always order the toast with assorted toppings, such as Roasted Apple or Nuttella/Peanut Butter. I had the quiche with the salad, which was just enough food for mid-morning. The drip coffee is Collectivo and the server comes around several times to top up your coffee. Every menu item comes with a beer pairing (yes, even breakfast) and there is there tremendous Bloody Mary menu to pick and choose from. One of my fellow reviewers mentioned how the beer menu is overwhelming. I noticed that if you concentrate on the tap beers, signified by dot and the Belgium beers that are specially made for Cafe Hollander, also signified by a dot after the name, you have parred your decisions down to a manageable level. You can request a free taste sample of the tap beers to decide which one you like. Best of all, it is blessedly, blessedly quiet and you can linger with one the newspapers in the holder across from the hostess station. I'm scared that it will not be long before the dreaded Mommy brigade finds out about for breakfast.

So, the Sunday brunch. I would suggest you become acquainted with the Metro 2 bus schedule that stops at Hilldale, because if you have someone in your party who has mobility issues, they are going to have traverse a good portion of the parking lot, even in late afternoon. Even around 2 pm, they were packed and taking reservations with a 25 minute or more wait. Cafe Hollander asks for your name and phone number for the wait for a table & then texts you when a table opens up. I was lucky it was a nice day out today, so I could wait outside. The table I was lead to was in the atrium section (with the tree in the middle and the plant boxes near the ceiling). The tables are close together in that section and every kid, whether they were mobile or carried in arms, had to kick my table to get by. It didn't help that an oblivious family had planted a huge, open diaper bag right in the path of where every server had to get by. (One of the exit doors was blocked by an enormous battering ram stroller, because of course it was). I didn't feel like breakfast food at that time of day, so I ordered the burger, which didn't list lettuce or tomato on the menu and wasn't offered when I ordered the burger. Yes, I could have ordered when the server came back, but given that I wasn't given a napkin or silverware when my food came, I wasn't going to press my luck with getting tomato/lettuce. Understandably, they were busy and a lot of things were going on around me. It wasn't for me, but if you are the kind of person or party that is not put off by large, messy families or a lot of noise, this is the place for you on a Sunday."
test_1887,The dryers are horrible don't work well. And when we had the workers wash our clothes we asked them to call us back. Didn't hear anything for two days and the pie clothes were stained pink. NEVER going back.
test_1888,"Visiting friends in Waxhaw ... Went to Maxwell's during the Autumn treasures festival (cancelled due to rain) ... Wait staff in costumes, food was delicious, wine list excellent!  From Boston so we are tough critics.  Burgers, steaks and pulled pork was all great!  Caesar salad was so crisp.  Great kids menu!"
test_1889,"Ate at this place once or twice when I lived near the area. The service is always nice and the inside is clean, but the menu is quite inauthentic and overall a bit bland."
test_1890,"Amazing; best wax ever! 

Ask for Melanie; she is amazing! I love it here!

Staff are friendly and helpful. Melanie is just brilliant; she explains what she is doing, is relaxed and will check in with you throughout the treatment to make sure you are ok.

I was seen straight away, no waiting! While I was waiting for my friend to finish up I was offered a drink.

You should book.

Rooms are clean, dvd player; Modern Family was playing. I laughed all the way through my waxing. 

Brazilian costs about $55, up keep is $45 (plus tax and tip). I had my eyebrows done too...so quick.

Most pain free wax I have had. 

I cannot stress enough how good my experience was...bounced out of there with a spring in my step"
test_1891,"My kids have been seeing Dr Abrams for about 4 years now and they love her!  They are very good and patient with them.  

Wait time is not too bad...just remember they are working on kids time (as noted in their waiting room) so be patient.  Their waiting room is kid friendly as well, with a tv, game consoles, and other games."
test_1892,"Best ice cream I ever had! Try the caramel banana or the starburst they are delicious and the service is so good. You can tell they are family owned, great spot for kids, they also have board games."
test_1893,Good food. Fried rice is moist. Shrimp plentiful. Staff pleasant and friendly. Weekend brunch is $20.99 but a bounty.
test_1894,"The meat is locally sourced and was very good; I had the ""naked brisket."" The two sides I chose, weren't anything stellar though. The white cheddar mac' n cheese was too garlicky and the original hush puppies were hard to bite into, either too much batter or fried too long. The mini corn bread was super moist and yummy though. I will definitely go back for the beef, but will select different sides."
test_1895,"Obsidian is one of the finest art galleries around. Every time I go in, it seems there's something there that takes my breath away. I just stand and stare in awe. 
Ever-changing original artwork displays the walls, and they also have affordable prints available.
Artists Mandy Joy and Steve Anthony are so incredibly talented! Their styles are different, yet they work so well together, creating an inviting environment for art lovers and curious passerbys. 
Visiting Obsidian is always a delight, and a highlight of the World Famous Arts Factory."
test_1896,"Amazing pizza. The crust is thin and chewy. Cooked to perfection. Soft inside and crusty outside. It holds the toppings without getting soggy. The sauce is tangy and delicious. We will definitely be coming back. This is my new ""go to"" pizza restaurant. Salad was fresh. Yummy!!"
test_1897,This place is so fun with super yummy food and drinks. The employees are all so friendly and happy and the music is great.  Try to pork belly lettuce wraps! You won't be disappointed!
test_1898,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. 
Parking lot is small and around the back. 
Restaurant is small but spacious; looks renovated.

Ordered the 888 Combo that comes with Sashimi (8pcs), Sushi (8pcs), Special roll of your choice (we picked Black Dragon Roll) and Nichiban Sushi that comes with Sushi (12pcs), California Roll (6pcs). 

Sushi was fresh; good quality for price. Would recommend."

test_1900,"It's almost not worth writing a review since everyone else has already posted 4-5 stars, but I'm going to throw my hat in the ring anyway--Spoon was that good. We went for our anniversary and had the meal of a lifetime. The bread basket was AMAZING (sometimes I wonder aloud if I can order it to go), the appetizers delicious, and the entrees superb. We took a dessert home to the friend who was babysitting, and she said it was excellent. Really nothing was less than 5 stars. Even the service was terrific--we told them it was our anniversary and they waived the corkage fee on our bottle of wine. Very thoughtful. We can't wait to go back for another special occasion (unfortunately it's not priced to be a regular outing for us), if only to load up on the bread basket again. Yum."
test_1901,I just want to thank I believe his name is Doug I'm not sure.. I was dealing with another company (ss) for months they must have been out to my house 6 times I finally called Mohave based on their yelp reviews the problem was fixed!! These guys are great!! Thank you
test_1902,"Great location, great buffet, great food and great service.you just can't go wrong dining at the palace station feast buffet."
test_1903,"The service is bad! Our server (she's an old lady)  just keep running away from us and seemed irritated when we ask questions or order for more.

I even put my hands up so she can see me, yet she just ignored me and just keep going back to the kitchen. 

But the other server (young lady) was very nice and friendly though.

The marinated short ribs kalbi was very good! 
Unfortunately... 2 pieces only per person... Its not AYCE.

$32.99 for dinner per person"
test_1904,"Wow!! So I was fortunate enough to check out this fantastic new venue a week ago while seeing the GREAT BILLY JOEL!  Now mind you, I am a concert goer. I have loved live music since 1987... Quiet don't age comment! So with that said, I have been to all sorts of venues through Several states and countries. The new T-Mobile is one of my new favorites, for the type of concert I was seeing.

There are very important features for me when it comes to a large type venue and the T-Mobile has met and exceeded them. I'm assuming since they are a newer venue, they have taken into consideration the modern needs... Maybe? 

So here are a few (not all) factors I look for in venues.

1. PARKING: I'm from LA so the first thing we think of 
besides traffic is parking. We actually obsess about parking and willing to arrive early to get a good spot. Parking was easy, since we parked next door at NYNY and yes... We arrived early. Event parking was $20.. Fine... I'm used to that in other cities. What's cool is there is an escalator that takes you from level 2, right to the arena. Brilliant!

2. LINES: I hate lines, ques, how ever you call them. T-Mobile had so many doors open so it was quick to get in. Just remember to never settle and go to the first line you see. Go to the right as you will see plenty of little lines just waiting for you. Eyes open people, you're not sheep!

3. VIEW: for all you people who are slightly tall or tall, you are a curse to everyone else! Sorry but it's true. I'm 5'4 so anyone reaching the 6' height who I think will sit in the vicinity of 2-3 rows in front of me, I start to panic. I think T-Mobile put us short ppl into consideration because the arena seems steeper, so the rows tend to be lower in front. The feeling of the chairs seem to have a lift, so even if Shaquille sat in front of me I wouldn't yell ""hey you... Down in the front!""

I have more but these 3 are important to me besides good acoustics, which are awesome at this joint.

So yes!!! All the stars in the cosmos for T-Mobile!! *****"
test_1905,"We walked by this restaurant and saw the menus posted up front, which was convenient since we compared it to another restaurant next door that also had menus posted up and decided to go to this place because the prices looked better.

It was 5 PM and the place was completely empty. It's a small restaurant, with seating for about 20. They have two tables up front by the windows, which provide a great view of the LCBO across the street. There are decorations along the walls, and books on tibetan culture available for your use while you're waiting for food to be prepared. There's a TV near the back, with various music videos playing including some tibetan dances and buddhist chanting.

They've got one washroom in the basement. The entrance to the basement is hidden behind a large curtain. However, right behind the curtain, is the door, which may be closed. Of course, you won't know there's a door there because it's hidden by the curtain! So if you're used to just walking through these kinds of things, make sure you stick your hand in front. It is also a stairway down into pitch black darkness, which is quite interesting to see. You should definitely check it out when the light's turned off.

The menu provides a decent variety of options. We were wondering what were some more tibetan options and ended up getting some momo's, shabhaley, and a bhutanese dish called ""Phak Sha Paa"" which was pork belly with radish, marinated in a number of different ingredients.

You can hear them cooking your food in the kitchen. This may be in part due to the lack of customers so making food as they are ordered makes more sense. In any case, be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your food.

Between the four of us, we shared 10 cooked momo's, 10 fried momo's, 4 shabhaley, and a plate of pork belly. The momo's were good: generous amount of meat inside. Shabhaley was not as crispy as I thought it would be, but it was still pretty good.

The pork belly was disappointing. There was a picture at the back of the menu that showed a nice large plate of pork belly, but when it came out, we realized there were only 4 slices of pork belly, and the rest was radishes. And this was one of their more expensive dishes at 10.99! It tasted alright, but definitely would pick something else.

When you're paying the bill, they take cash, credit and debit. But they also take apple pay if you prefer something more modern. They'll also split your bills no problem.

Overall, it's a nice place if you have time to sit and eat."
test_1906,had Marco tint my A6 and put 3M clear bra on the M3 and A6.  Perfect job.  just awesome.  Will be bringing him 2 other cars soon.
test_1907,"Update.  I've tried them again.  Loved the fries dipped in BBQ sauce.  I got a grilled chicken sandwich was good, but a little dry.  Plenty of lettuce, the tomato was fresh.  The honey mustard was good.  I didn't care much for the milkshakes, but they were OK.  For half price during happy hour they are a good deal.  I also tried the apple slices with caramel dip - excellent side.  The lemonade was great - not too strong, but I think a bit more sugar would be a good idea.  I went through the drive through - very quick service.  The workers were very nice."
test_1908,"Probably the coolest little record store to find some great gems outside of California. I spent about two hours here just crate diggin', and the people working here are extremely friendly/helpful. This spot is rad!"
test_1909,"OK....I'm originally from New Jersey. Growing up, my family used to get out take out pizza from a place where the owner (Nino) didn't speak any English....he was from Italy.  Nino tossed the pizza by hand (with no rubber gloves - GASP!) and used to hide his money in one of the pizza boxes rather than use the cash register. This was an era before Domino's, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. So this has become the yardstick by which all pizza is measured for me. 

I'm happy to say that Jimmy & Joe's passes the litmus test ol' man Nino established for me years ago....a nice, family owned place with good value and an excellent quality pizza. Sauce can make or break a pizza and J&J's does not disappoint; it's tangy and delicious and the pie (that's right...pie!) has just the right balance of cheese and sauce. While I can't comment on any of the specialty pizzas (hey I'm a purist...cheese or pepperoni for me!) I can say that the pepperoni is spicy and flavorful and has a unique taste that I haven't found anywhere else.  

Jimmy and Joe's is small...almost hidden away but it it well worth the hunt for this Chandler pizza gem. Not really good for large parties (unless you are taking out - of course) but great to duck in for a slice. They also have a drive in pick-up spot (complete with one of those pneumatic rubber hose bell ringers!) that I make regular use of. 

You will not be disappointed."
test_1910,My daughter loves this place. It is also our family's favorite place in the evening. Lots of books for kids and some toys to play. Staffs are kind and always approachable.
test_1911,"What to try?

The caramel pudding milk tea and the Oreo milk tea. If you love milk tea and you love chewy textures, you'll like caramel pudding milk tea. You can even ask for no sugar if you want because the caramel pudding bites at the bottom are actually quite sweet already! The Oreo milk tea is usually the milk tea I like to recommend my first time goer friends because they're already familiar with Oreo and it's not found everywhere in Toronto this kind of unique drink. Usually they're impressed with it!

Last tip?

Take advantage of the daily specials because you can get a size of a large of the drink of the day for the price of a small. Saves some money. For example, caramel pudding drink is on special on Wednesdays usually. Their chillers which are crushed ice drinks are usually really good too. I also like their black diamond spa milk tea which has grass jelly and red bean!"
test_1912,At'Cher Service helped me with our Cabrio Whirlpool Dryer.  We had them out to fix it because the door would not latch.  They came our when it worked for us and it was the same day!  We called 2 other appliance repair companies and they didn't even answer the phone.  Thank you At'Cher Service!
test_1913,"This is the first pizza I had when my wife and I moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco about 10 years ago.  When I had it I thought, this pizza is okay, but the sauce is really good.  Ever since, we've always ordered it with extra sauce and it's been great.  I would give their standard pizza 3 stars--but with extra sauce, as you should order it and they should start serving it--it's 5 star pizza as good as any in Pittsburgh."
test_1914,"I ate here two times: My first time and my last time.

Walking in and seeing only three other tables occupied, and not being greeted or seated promptly is not really a good start. 

It's also annoying to wait nearly 10 minutes for your server to greet you and bring you menus.

A taco salad does NOT consist of greasy shredded steak that you'd find in a Philly Cheesesteak, mixed salad greens, sweet dressing in a greasy taco shell.

When said ""taco salad"" was pointed out as not being a taco salad, having a waitress try to tell me I didn't read the menu right and that's how it comes was laughable seeing as though the menu described it as having: ground beef, pico de gallo, sour cream, black beans and guacamole.

The only saving grace was that I only paid $4.99 for that joke of a taco salad (Happy Hour). Yes, I still ended up paying for it...

It may be Rhodes Ranch, but even Taco Bell can make a better taco salad.

Thanks but no thanks!"
test_1915,"Really friendly staff.  We ordered some pakoras, channa masala, naan, rice, butter chicken, and bindi sabji.  The pakoras were yummy  - these particular ones had a lot more chickpea in them than onion. The channa masala was a tad watery and tasted like it had been poured out of a can and marinated for a few minutes.  The naan and rice were good (but I was secretly hoping there would be some saffron in the rice).  Butter chicken was good - the chicken was tender (on another note, I find it really hard to mess up butter chicken - only once have I had a bad one.)  The bindi sabji was fantastic.  Pan fried and delicious with the addition of the potatoes.  

Although it is a chain, I prefer the cooking at the Bombay Bhel at Hurontario than this one."
test_1916,"Fantastic!!  Can't say enough about Jazz and her facials.  She is the best! and trust me, I have traveled the valley in search of a great skin care coach.  In fact, I travel about 18 miles one way just to see her - she is worth it!  Very fair pricing, an overall great experience.  My skin has never looked better and I appreciate her approach and technique.  You are not rushed and she takes special care to recommend what would be best for your skin.   Jazz also doesn't try to push products or other procedures not needed.  I would recommend her to everyone without hesitation."
test_1917,"A must stop place for ice cream, smoothies, and soup. Chili was the best ever! Try it and I guarantee you'll be back."
test_1918,"I booked an appt for 3 people (two adults one child). They only have 2 pedicure chairs. So, we all had to go at different times because one was already pre occupied. I bought a groupon for a 1 hour hydrotherapy pedicure & massage. My whole pedicure took 20mins or less. She only did one coat of paint and the paint job was mediocre. No massage. My friend's pedicure on the other hand took over an hour and they didn't use any product. Paint job was bad and the water was cold. Neither one of us left feeling it was money well spent. The ladies were pleasant."
test_1919,"I have been here a couple of times.  We have a dear friend that likes to eat here.  When a friend is offering to treat you to dinner, you can't really argue about where you are going to dine, at least not in this case.  Anyway, while I appreciated the gesture, this place is not one of my favorites.  I have had way worse, but I have definitely had better.  

As I have mentioned in other reviews, I am a strict vegetarian (vegan) so my options are often limited, especially at a restaurant such as this.  I often end up with fries or a plain baked potato and a salad at many places, including this one.  As far as salads go the ones I have had here are alright, but nothing special and mostly made up of iceberg lettuce.  Their french fries have got to be your run of the mill frozen crinkle cuts that you see at most any place that doesn't make their own.  I can just picture the bag in my head that would read ""Gordon Food Service...""  

My friend and husband seem to enjoy enjoy their meals when we have been here.  Usually prime rib.  Just, from my perspective though, the vegetables on the side looked pathetic-obviously previously frozen, watery and mushy looking broccoli, etc.  

There is a main dining room which is brightly lit or you can sit in the larger bar area which is darker and more comfortable.  Both sides have always been dead when we were there though.  The ambiance is a little lacking and seems disconnected, but it's hard for me to put it into words.  Too open??  In any case, not especially comfortable to me.  The jukebox never seems to be working right either so I had to get refunds.  

So, you won't starve here and it's alright just not something I am super excited about or would recommend to a friend.  Like I said, if it were up to me, this wouldn't be my first choice.  I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, but I doubt this would be Gordon Ramsay approved...  It could be greatly improved with some fresh vegetables and less frozen stuff.  In my case, the company of my husband and friend made it alright.  I wasn't there for the food.  Just to catch up and have a good time among ourselves.  And I did mention they have a bar, right?  =)"
test_1920,Just recently found out about this place.  Went in with a bunch of old crap and came out with almost a hundred bucks in credit.  I just wish I knew about it before I gave two crates of disney movies to savers.
test_1921,"This is kind of a neat concept but I've heard people say they order pizza so they won't have to cook.  Well, if you order delivery, you have to WAIT, so listen up!

My fiance' and I went in to pick up a couple of pizzas off of their coupon specials.  We were greeted at the door by the owner.  She walked us through the process (since we had never done this before) which was extremely simple.  We ordered, we waited about 5 minutes and our pizzas were ready, freshly prepared right in front of us.

We got home, stuck one of them in the oven (the other in the freezer for later) and it was ready in about 15 minutes.  Quicker than delivery!  BEST PIZZA I'VE PROBABLY EVER HAD!  The ingredients were fresh, the crust was amazing and I will be a regular!  

Don't think you want to cook it yourself?  Then suffer with the bad pizza deliveries out there, I'm going to Papa Murphy's!  =)"
test_1922,The food here is so good. I can honestly say this was the best chicken I EVER had. Highly recommend!

I was in town with the family for the civic holiday weekend, and thanks to DS Tours it was a weekend we will never forget!

Asked them what was so funny and they  pretended to not hear what I said.  I drop it and proceeded to order my simply small coffee, still puzzled.  She asked all the wrong questions, like did a want my coffee iced on a raining early morning yet left out all the basic normal questions like sugar, black etc.  Had to ask for everything single item that I wanted one by one since she obviously was not interested in serving me; I finally demanded a receipt when all was said and done, throw out the coffee I now did not trust and left; sad thing too is I think this was the manager. This was the first time for mehere  however am never going back; The starbucks in Frys is a lot better mannered/service and with none of the immaturity or unprofessionalism."
test_1926,Lovely restaurant we went for breakfast/lunch we sat in the patio nice view to the pool. Food was awesome and to be so fancy the price was great '.
test_1927,Good and fair prices compare to Staples and OfficeDepot.  Much friendly employees too.
test_1928,"Absolutely delicious!!! We're visiting Montreal and decided to give this place a try and were truly impressed. Absolutely amazing food. We skipped starter but shared the Chicken Red Curry, Beef Yellow Curry (all dishes are vegetarian meats) and a side of vegetable fried rice. The chicken dish was very tasty but the beef curry even moreso. Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Even the veggie fried rice had large pieces of veggies in it. I cannot fault anything about the whole meal - wonderfully tasty and all veggie too!

My husband also ordered the tapioca dessert which came with a thin layer of coconut cream on top. Oh my, that too was light, tasty and simply fabulous.

If you're a vegetarian or vegan you should eat here. If you're a meat eater, you should REALLY eat here, it'll teach you why people give up eating meat when there are such delectable alternatives without the cruelty and chemicals.

I cannot recommend ChuChai highly enough - just go.....Now! .....Seriously!"
test_1929,"I was craving pizza and didn't want to settle for the regular, doughy kind, I wanted a wood fire, thin crust pizza and we drove right by only to make the U-turn. 
We had been here a few times before, but to be truthful, couldn't recall what I had, but remembered I like it! A quick look at the pizza's and I knew it would be the spicy Italian sausage. 
When it arrived, it was very thin crust indeed, so thin, the juices from the sausage and mushrooms seemed to have melted through the crust, it was impossible to eat without a utensil. 
My hubby was trying to do right and keep to his diet, so he ordered the Caesar salad with chicken breast, it had to be the biggest salad, it was big enough for the two of us and then some!  
Overall, the staff was quick with the refills, friendly, the place smelled really good, and the pizza, well, I would definitely try again."
test_1930,"I had been lusting after an MV Agusta Brutale since the 800s were announced. While on a trip to Vegas I took advantage of the opportunity to see one in person before throwing down the money to order one from a dealership closer to home. I had a great experience talking with Craig. Even knowing that I wasn't going to buy a bike from him, he took the time to answer my questions and talk bikes in general. When the dealer near my house fell through, I had such a positive experience with Freedom Cycles that it was worth it for me to get the bike through them and pay to have it shipped cross country. Their professionalism, communication regarding any issues, and customer service would make them my go to dealership if I were in the area. Highly recommended."
test_1931,"Why would this facility host a tournament event for over 30 teams and over 200 people with the ac off?! It's 112 degrees in there! I asked the employees why the air is off and they claim it's not, they turned it on at 7am. It's 2pm and over 100 in this faculty with a full gym of boys playing basketball, this is not safe! At $10 a head to get in and tournament fees, you should be able to prepare better and cool your facilities. Absolutely ridiculous!"

test_1935,"The Family Unit went to Las Vegas decades ago when it was the era of somewhere between the eras of The Rat Pack and the family groups, The Osmond Brothers and The Jackson Five, when they used to perform in Las Vegas. Long before Las Vegas Boulevard as it is today.  I haven't returned to Vegas in quite some time; the last time I was there was when Siegfried and Roy were still performing at The Mirage. 

My first grown-up holiday to Las Vegas was to visit a couple of friends (who are no longer with us) when they moved there; they were like the cool aunts one wished they always had.  (I will refer to them as ""The Aunts."") The moment I got off the plane, Vegas felt like home. I thought when The Aunts would pick me up and we would go home to their place. Oh no, we didn't. 

The next thing I knew, we were headed to Las Vegas Boulevard for Girls' Night Out. We went to The Mirage Hotel (when Steve Wynn still owned the hotel). I got to see Siegfried and Roy's tiger display; The Aunts knew I wanted to see the tigers. We went to one of the bars where I had one of the best pi√±a colladas ever in my life. I was asked/invited to dance by some of the men who were at the bar. I was too tired to dance, did not want to, and said no. Some of them would not take no for an answer. The Aunts firmly had to tell them to back off as they backed my story as I got off of the plane and was quite tired!  I did get a lecture from one of the aunts about letting these guys dance with me. Some of them were not my type and I could tell they needed liquid courage to ask me to dance. Besides, I was exercising my rights to say ""No!"" 

After The Mirage, we went to Treasure Island, Caesar's Palace and Circus Circus. Oh my gosh, wow! One of the aunts got a kick out of watching my eyes widen and awe at the sight of what these hotels and casinos had to offer. They also introduced me to Bacchus, I had to meet Bacchus and his court.  And we did have more drinks, I had Bucks Fizz or what is known as Mimosas at these hotels. We then stopped for a greasy breakfast at Sam's. We did not get to their house until at 3:00 A.M. in the morning.  

The Aunts surprised me--we were going to see Bette Midler at the MGM Grand Hotel before I arrived in Vegas. One of them let the cat out of the bag, the other was not too pleased with her for doing that. Cor! Bette Midler--The Divine Ms. M?! The other surprise was spending the day getting ready for the event. One of The Aunts treated us to an afternoon getting hair, make-up and nails done at the salon. 

We paid our respects to Bacchus and the Court before an early dinner at an Italian ristorante back at Caesar's Palace.  At Caesar's, The Aunts wanted to take pictures of me with one of the gladiators. Well, while The Aunts were arguing amongst themselves about the camera, I ducked behind the gladiator's shield and giggled conspiratorially. The gladiator caught on to my little scheme and hid with me.  It did not take long when one of The Aunts called out, ""Hey you two--get out from behind there!"" When we did, my gladiator and I were laughing and The Aunts got their picture. I gave the gladiator a peck on the cheek merci and au revoir. At the Italian restaurant, The Aunts wanted a picture of me with our server; that was a bit awkward, yet our server was a good sport about it all.  

Bette Midler was awesome and amazing! I learned so much about nuts and balls from The Divine Ms. M during her show as well as how to spin them. After the show, more drinks! Bucks Fizz pour moi, s'il vous plait!

I made more return visits to Vegas either seeing The Aunts or with friends from out-of-town.  I saw Michael Crawford in EFX at The MGM Grand and Siegfried and Roy at The Mirage in one night during a weekend in Vegas with one of my bestie girlfriends. I saw S&R during a New Year's Eve performance and got to greet them after the show. I met Roy's mother before the show and she gave me a kiss on the cheek. Siegfried kissed me on both cheeks for New Year's. And Roy gave me a big hug (which I can still feel) and kisses on both cheeks when I thanked him for the magic in my life. Las Vegas on NYE is something I would not do again, outside felt like an insane asylum and traumatized one of the guests in my party when we were trying to get a taxi. Never again Las Vegas on New Year's Eve, way too insane for my tastes.

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I do know about the code. Well, I did not disclose all the details, there are some things I kept to myself. And all of these events took place long before serious and strict enforcement of the code existed. I know from here on out I will have to follow the code starting with the next visit, whenever that is.

Viva Las Vegas!

test_1937,"I've been anticipating a chance to have my hair done by Lisa for quite some time, but she was based in Mississauga when I discovered her work, but when she opened her salon in Toronto I was trilled! I just recently had my hair cut and coloured my Lisa her self and I could not be any more happier with how it turned out. I did have a different colour style that I intentionally wanted but i trusted Lisa to do what she does best and allow her to colour my hair how she felt would suit my hair and the colour treatments I had done before. 
The salon itself is easy to find and its very clean and classy. I would recommend any girl looking to have her hair done professionally to book with Lisa! She is very busy and always booked for months so you do have to keep in mind that your going to be booking for months ahead. 
She also brought her cute adorable puppy Toby to the salon! I enjoyed his presence and so did my boyfriend who came along with me. 
Follow her on Insta @lisadinhhairstudio to check out her work and salon! 

I admire her work and passion for what she does  girl power!"

test_1941,"I had high expectation of this place from reading the other reviews. I don't know if it was just an off night or of all these people are wrong. 

Service was soooo slow and our server was never anywhere to be seen. Took her ages to take our order. Food took ages to come, and it was cold. Plus when we asked for the  bill it took her 5 mins to bring the credit card machine over. 

Maybe they were busy, but for the size of the place and the amount of people in there I really don't think this was"
test_1942,"This place is a cute authentic little Argentinian/ Italian restaurant and market that sticks out like a sore thumb in the heart of Chinatown in the Cathay Hills Plaza center. My boyfriend, is half Italian and Argentinian and he was eager to try this place out for dinner.   

When we walked in, the restaurant/market smelled delicious! It didn't help that we were starving and wanted to order everything on the menu. Luckily the server quickly brought out complimentary bread and homemade chimichurri. We both wished the bread was warm or toasted, but it wasn't - it was room temperature. The bread wasn't the best or the freshest, but the chimichurri certainly made up for it. The chimichurri was flavorful and had a nice acidity to it.  

We ended up with 4 different hot baked empanadas $2.25 each: 
Beef - Very rich and meaty flavor, my boyfriend like this one the most. 4/5

Spinach - thick spinach and cheese filling. I enjoyed this one. 4/5

Corn - piping hot insides and tasted similar to creamed corn - just not as sweet. 2/5

Ham & cheese - this one also had a very hot and gooey cheese filling and ham bits. This is one of my favorites. 4/5

Also we shared a rather huge hot sandwich - Lomito Completo $10.99:
Not worth $11 - A very thin hammered down piece of mignon with melted provolone cheese, very salty ham, fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, mayo, on a baguette bread. The steak and ham were thin and way over salted. The salt was so strong that it offended my taste buds. The fried egg was overcooked so it didn't have a runny yolk and that's always a shame in my book. The sandwich was a generous size in a huge bread roll. We were only able to tackle a half of it. The fries that accompanied it were nice, hot and crispy, just the way I like my fries. I just couldn't get past the over salting issue - I could feel my mouth shriveling up. 2/5

We also ordered 1 soda. Our total damage was $25 and change. 

In the end, we were uncomfortably full - everything was extremely heavy, oily, and extra salty. I did appreciate their empanadas, but the hot sandwich was a hot salty mess."
test_1943,Great place to stay. Office staff and managers are super helpful. We would highly recommend staying there. Whenever you need the maintenance people they are there to help you put your RV in and fix whatever problems you have
test_1944,"This is my favroite buffet in Vegas.  When I lived there, I would go here all the time.  It's cheap as you get in early!!  

I've only been here for breakfast but I love it.  Get there before 10AM and it's only $12.99 I think.  

So yummy!!!"
test_1945,"Angie's List makes it difficult to cancel and they will bill you for another year because they make you ""autorenew"" when you sign up.  Because of the auto renew payment was setup as authorized, you cannot dispute the charge.  Their 888 number is only for certain members, otherwise it's useless.  The chat doesn't work because there are no agents.  Your only recourse is the form that you fill out online and they have not responded to me for cancellation after 2 tries.  What a bunch of crooks."
test_1946,"Some of the slowest service I've ever had.
Nice server, who you'd think was totally in the weeds, yet the place was boringly quiet. I'll say half full.

When we came to pay, we did pay separately, I know, not something I normally recommend.

But then it took fifteen to twenty minutes to pay someone, anyone.

I'm not going to say its the worst service, or something like, ""I'll never be back.""

Bit its not going to be a pick of mine.

Just try harder, actually, just try."

They have a lunch special from 11-3 for a gyro plus salad or fries.  It may just be in the summer... I don't know, but it's a good deal.  Good size portion and healthy too! Can't beat that! Express restaurant gets an express five star rating."

test_1950,"We came here for Cosmic Bowling last weekend and had a great time.  It's $19.99/per person including shoes to play from 10pm - 1am.  Lights go out and black lights turn on.  Everything that can glow, will glow.  We were a party of 7 and had 2 lanes side-by-side.  The music was great - a bunch of oldies from my time.  I can't say my bowling score was the same. :(  Nonetheless it was fun.  The garlic fries were delish and so where the pretzel trios.  Reasonably priced and staff there were friendly and efficient.  I definitely would come back again...but then I was out wayyy past my bedtime. :)"
test_1951,"Okay, I am a big fan of Ikea! When you know, you are trying to ball on a budget this is the place to go for legit furniture. Sure does it take some time to put together, yes. But, can you find a pretty solid dining room table for $139, you sure can!

This location is okay. It is the normal size you would expect but, my biggest problem were the registers. I went in on a Sunday and had to wait a solid half hour (if not more) to get to a cashier. To me that is a bit much. If you know Sunday is your busy day well, then put more cashiers on staff. Waiting that long trying to push my heavy ish forward a few inches every few minutes does not make me a happy camper.

Also lets talk about the loading zone. Why in the world would you fence it off so you can't fit your cart thing through?! I am not a strong person so when I am loading heavy things into my car I need to be right up against my car, not a few feet away. I have never seen that type of setup at an Ikea before, probably because it doesn't make any sense. I am really not sure what the logic was there.

I almost forgot, those delicious cinnamon buns are a must purchase. They are only a $1 of hot, gooey, cinnamoney, deliciousness. I literally completely loaded up my car in some far reach of that parking lot and went back in to get a cinnamon bun."

test_1953,"We have had Sauce delivered on several occasions... But, have never eaten at the restaurant. We were quite happy with the food and the delivery time until our last order. Not only had the menu changed, but the food wasn't nearly as tasty. We may give them another shot... But, if things continue as they were, we will NOT eat from there again."
test_1954,Ooh la la pre wedding antipasto is superb. Much nicer on the inside than the outside. Broken lights in the upstairs bathroom. Didn't see how people would get upstairs if they had a wheelchair. Lots of free parking. Nice place for a wedding. Lovely decor.

test_1957,"I had been waiting to try breakfast at this place for awhile. We visited on a Sunday around 11am. Waited about 15 minutes. As soon as we walked in, we were not greeted. Then the lady finally said ""what's your name and how many?"". After we gave her the info she never said anything else she just ignored us like we weren't standing there then asked the next person the same thing. I thought it was very rude to be honest and I wanted to leave but my boyfriend wanted to try the food also. The waitress was nice. The food took some time to come out. Muffins were nothing special. You don't get much food. I ordered the huevos rancheros and I took one bite and did not touch the rest. They had huge tomatoes in there with oinions and big pieces of bell peppers which I never seen on huevos rancheros. All I ate was the potatoes which tasted like bacon or sausage (This is a problem because I dont eat pork). We will not be returning."

She did an excellent job on my brows prior to my wedding. Love her work:)"
test_1959,"To be honest, if I didn't have a friend that tends bar here, I probably never would have gone. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, and since its less than a mile from my home Pub (Tim Finnegan's) I have little reason to stop in.

When I did, it was exactly what I expected. Lots of TVs with sports on, decent beer selection and ""meh"" food. I will be honest, the wings at Tim Finnegan's are better, which is sad considering that is kind of Buffalo Wild Wing's staple menu item.

The other challenge is that this and the new Olive Garden building are in a... less nice part of Metrocenter circle, right next to 2 cheap motels. Good if you wanna score crack or a prostitute, bad if you want your car to be safe in the lot after dark. 

If you wanna watch a game in a chain restaurant, this is the place. If you wanna hang out in a bar with some personality, drive a mile south."
test_1960,"The burrito I had was way too expensive, small, and bland. If you like burritos, don't get one here."
test_1961,"I planned  a bachelorette party (group of 5) and came here for Saturday champagne brunch - what a fantastic experience!  It was really a highlight of the day, and we had a lot of fun stuff that day.

Definitely make a reservation (like everywhere in Vegas, it seems).  The wait was long, but since I'd booked on opentable, we were seated immediately.

First, the service.  Our server (Carmie I believe) had a ton of tables, yet she checked on us frequently and never left us with empty champagne classes.  She was so sweet.  We did unlimited small plates, and she started us off with some of her favorite/the most popular dishes and then let us order anything we wanted.  Even though she was obviously super busy, she had a huge happy smile all the time, and managed to chat with us for a moment each time she stopped by.  I don't know how people like her do it.

Second, the food. It was outrageously good. I can't believe I've never had breakfast small plates before - you don't have to choose! The shrimp and grits, short rib hash, and frittata were favorites with us.  We ate like kings for a super reasonable price, in a cute location.  We were STUFFED - brunch was at noon, and none of us was hungry for dinner at 7pm.

By VEGAS standards, this place is $$ I think; by yelp's listed standard, it's $$$.  Unlimited small plates cost I think $33 per person and unlimited mimosas on top of that was $8 or $9.

Highly recommend this place."
test_1962,Imagine a painless Brazillian well then you'll love this place! Sara is amazing (not me the girl working there :)) The staff is friendly and treatments are priced at a reasonable price. They also have products that they sell which I am a big fan of! Will definitely be a regular and I cant wait for my next visit.
test_1963,"I wanted to like this local family owned establishment so much, but I just cannot after my breakfast order.  I basically had eggs Benedict with sausage patty instead of Canadian bacon. It came with country hollandaise sauce even though I asked to keep the regular, the eggs were overcooked and basically boiled. When you cut them the inside yolk was solid. I mentioned to my server and although he apologized no attempt to reduce my bill was made.  Not very good service recovery in my opinion.  The hash browns were good as was the crispy bacon that I asked for. The coffee also was fresh to the taste."
test_1964,"We are a local nonprofit agency that has been unfortunately hit several times by vandals/burglars. We are fully alarmed but we don't contract foot patrol security. Green Valley Security has been amazing each and every time something bad has happened. They've immediately upon request dispatched an officer to secure the facility for the rest of the night. They are highly reactive and super supportive when we've needed it most. Every interaction I have had with them has been nothing but positive. The owner even gave me a personal cell number to reach out after we were hit the last time so we could reach them at any time, day or night. I see several bad reviews on this page which is unfortunate because I have never had a bad experience with this company and we've needed them several times over the past three years. They have given me peace of mind on many sleepless nights."
test_1965,"Godly. Enough said. 6 time All Star, multiple gold glove winner, and 3 time NL MVP candidate."
test_1966,Best buffet in vegas!!! All of the staff was very nice and the food was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely be back!
test_1967,They always greet everyone with a smile who enters even when super busy. They have excellent customer service and I never had any problems coming to this store. I  highly recommend them and go see Mitch who will go above and beyond.
test_1968,"Was craving Thai food.... yelped to see what was close to home and stumbled upon this location. Went in to do a take out order at 8pmish, hostess was very nice and friendly and helped me pick out an appetizer. Ordered the pad Thai with chicken (not spicy) and was SUPER flavorful!  Ordered the pad Thai with beef spicy for my other half- he'd never had Thai food before and was very impressed!  Also ordered the sticky rice with mango and it was delicious. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to get their Thai fix :)"
test_1969,Will definitely go back. I was in desperate need of a short summer trim and they were fast and friendly. Walked right in and didn't have to wait.
test_1970,"Great service especially for Platinum members. 

Fun place for all golfing levels. 

Food is fantastic, beer is cold. 

I like going with the family, friends or solo to work on my swing."
test_1971,"Great real Mexican food, salsas are fresh and delicious and they have real fruit drinks. Will definitely be back to this place!"
test_1972,Happen to come across this place during my lunch break . I came here a year ago never finish my review I took a mixed plate than it was really good now I went for the rib streak that came with a  potato soup I liked the soup the steak I asked for a medium rare it's what I got and it was really good the chef was on his game today. I think it worth checking out for sure maybe during lunch time where it's not super packed. I'll warn you some plates will cost a lot and it doest look really fancy inside but the food so far is was great.
test_1973,"2018. 04. 23. I had a lunch with my previous manager nearby the Chinook Center. The name of the restaurant called Han Corea Korean Restaurant, which is a small Korean Restaurant, is hidden in the community in front of Chinook Mall. It's a friendly family based Korean Restaurant, which services surprised and authentic Korean Dishes. Besides that, it¬†offers free self-serve water, tea, and rice, which is a nice! We arrived the restaurant right after 12 pm on the weekday. It was still very busy. But, we were very lucky and found the table fast. We had very amazing experience eating at this restaurant. We only ordered the pork¬†bone Stew with bulgogi, tofu, enoki mushrooms,¬† onion, green onion, rice cakes and cellophane noodles to share. The taste of the soup was great depth and flavour. The bulgogi was very chewy. It was a super large portion, which could serve more than 3 people. The small cold dishes were great too, which were including bean sprouts, marinated egg, daikon and seaweed, soy sauce dipping sauce, mushrooms, salad, kimchi and cold style pancake. They were tasty and authentic. The owner and servers of the restaurant are all Korean. I guess that's why the food at Han Corea Restaurant are authentic and delicious. Highly Recommend people to try out Han Corea Korean Restaurant."
test_1974,If I could give a zero I would! Usually I love coming here but Tuesday night my husband and myself went and the bartender that was working was so rude. We waited forever for her to even acknowledge us and when she finally did she was just nasty. She had such a bad attitude that we didn't even stay we ended up giving the menus back and going elsewhere for dinner. Find a new job if you don't want to deal with people!!!!
test_1975,"I went tonight with my wife and I ordered their 16oz. prime rib done medium. What I got was what started out as medium, then thrown on a flat top to heat it. It came out medium well with a  fried surface. Not very appetizing and I wouldn't order this again."
test_1976,"I tried to order a couch online to have it shipped to the store. What a nightmare! It has been less than a pleasant experience. The issue has yet to be resolved. Fortunately the manager at this location Chris Barth has been extremely helpful. She researched the issue and she called me back with an answer. She is actively working on helping me resolve the problem. I appreciate her customer service and her follow through. Because of her, I will continue to shop at this Cost Plus. I WILL NOT however order anything from them
Online!! Thank you Chris for your assistance."
test_1977,Great customer service. My cat refused to eat the various petsmart wet food brands I tried out. She devoured the first can of raw food I brought home upon the store's recommendation.
test_1978,We sat while the hostess seated multiple other parties before us until we said something then were treated rudely when 7 of were seated at a table for 4. The manager just said sorry this is what we have available and then was also rude. I now know why this Bob Evans has a one star rating.
test_1979,"Huge place that is pretty hidden away, kind of sketchy. Plenty of tables and open spot, whether you need to get work done or meet up with some friends. Parking is a bit difficult as it looks like it's mostly street parking.

Latte was delicious and they have a great selection of beans they roast. I definitely had to buy some to take home."
test_1980,"I went yesterday as a drop-in client. I got in right away. The staff was very nice and professional, and the salon was clean and comfortable. I had a full set of acrylic overlays done on my natural nails. They look fantastic!! It was $30 plus tip which is very reasonable. I will be back!"
test_1981,"This buffet is ok. It's a small buffet, but they have some good quality items. I went on the Sunday brunch, with the all you can drink champagne and mimosas. I used a buy one get one free pass. Service was nice.

The salads are pretty good, and you can get a lot of avocado on it. The meats were good. Sushi was ok. I'd go again, if I have a buy one get one free pass. I would hesitate to pay full price, seems a little high. I left happy, so I will go back."
test_1982,"Arguably the worst Chinese food I've had.  For delivery anyway.  Bland, tasteless, and way overcooked.  
At least it was expensive and took 90 minutes to deliver."
test_1983,"The service is wonderful, but the steak frites is horrible. I asked for Medium Rare and they made it Medium Well. I would just stick to the chicken tenders and the salads."
test_1984,"Went here with my brother and sister in law for dinner. We sat at the hibachi table and they brought there to the table. It took them over an hour to even start cooking our food. When they did, they cooked one less chicken breast then people and unevenly distributed the food. As a person that was served second to last, my portion was significantly smaller than the people who were served first. The chef then made veggies and gave the other half the table the leftover veggies after giving everyone else veggies! Double the portions! I left still hungry and disappointed."
test_1985,"May 10, 2018 - I really don't like cheesecake!! BUT Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake is very good! It light, fluffy and yummy"
test_1986,I really love your studio it's not like any other studio I've ever visited it's very much like being a part of a very big family not to mention the instructors and the teachers have all been in the dance scene for years and are very well known across the globe & that is so exciting for Arizona.  B-Girl Bonita the owner is a very loving and compassionate individual who does everything in her power to help her students succeed and achieve their dreams.
test_1987,Love this place! I drive an hour and a half just to visit this store and get the in the incenses I want. I am bum that they don't sell mood candles anymore tho!
test_1988,"This place was amazing!! The food was high quality, fresh, and so tasty. The gentleman that helped me and my mom was so sweet. I'm looking forward to eating here again!"
test_1989,"What an awesome spot for brunch. Though we don't live too far away the traffic was horrendous and all we could think about was some yummy food to shovel into our mouths. Even though the place was packed we were luckily seated right away and presented with menu eery person wants to see on a Saturday morning. we all ordered what we wanted and didn't have to wait too long! Best part is, everything is made from scratch and you can def tell. 

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at a decent price and we will for sure be back."
test_1990,"Exceptionally fast and friendly service. The nachos are a must. This is the place to be for whisky enthusiasts, as the selection is amazing and reasonably priced."
test_1991,The best spot on MILL! Because of Genika the Persian princess and the guy with the dreads! Will is the best bartender ever! He knows how to make his drinks! Everyone is super nice and the music is always poppin'! And of COURSE DREW is the best ever! He always goes out of the way to make sure things are running perfectly!
test_1992,"Such slutty goodness!

Not gonna lie the line was a bit scary, I thought it was going to take forever but it moved so quickly I was shocked and might I add , SO worth the wait! Seating could be a pain as there isn't much room for seats. There is counter seating available along the storefront where you can watch the action in the kitchen. Luckily it's a fast paced breakfast place that people are constantly getting up and leaving just have to be on the lookout for a table/ empty chair. I highly recommend getting the orange juice! So fresh and so yummy!  Their pricing is actually decent, between $6-10 for a delicious breakfast sandwich"
test_1993,"Best Khao Soi in Toronto, and the staff is incredibly nice and warm! And when you think your food cant get any better, make sure to get some sticky rice and mango."
test_1994,"Haven't been this satisfied at a restaurant in a long time. 

I had the bacon avocado & cheese omelet with the grits and it was awesome. 

I will definitely come back to this place again"
test_1995,"Wow, from the outside you would have no idea that this Shoppers houses also an organic supermarket! No kidding - they have all the organic and gluten free/food alternatives you could find in a Whole Foods or Big Carrot. 

When walking in, you notice that it's a different decor than the others. They sell Crabtree and Evelyn products along with this huge organic and gluten free section in back. There's also regular Shoppers items in here too. 

The problem is, that it looks seedy and dusty and not that appealing. If they put brighter lights, I think the look of the store would appeal more. 

Free parking on site."
test_1996,"Great location. Easy to find and tons of parking. Super nice and friendly employees. This location is quite small inside but there is still a decent amount of seating inside. There is also some seating outside but not a lot. Fast service which I look for in Starbucks. Good food choices, they don't have everything though. Free wifi which is a plus. Clean and fresh looking bathroom. Overall this Starbucks was definitely a nice one and I had a pleasant visit with no disruptions to make it bad."
test_1997,"Being first time parents, my partner and I never knew how hard it would be to choose a school for our daughter. We did so much research and toured different schools. I knew I wanted my daughter to go to a Montessori since the beginning and we were so lucky to find Adobe. Mrs. Root was so welcoming and definitely gave me peace of mind during our tour. Mrs. Chavez is a wonderful teacher and all the assistants are great as well! Sophia has learned so much and always has something new to teach me every day. I love the ""work"" the kids do. The curriculum is awesome. Thank you Adobe!"
test_1998,"absolutely yummmmmmmy!!!!  yard bird is the best and the manager is excellent greg waters, restaurant manager thanks for having the best chef, waitress staff and your whole staff and fantastic food"
test_1999,"I'm back to visit and they are as delicious as before or better. The boil peanut Mac salad side dishes are kicking. Also,  they have all the island juices and the special tea.  I'll be back soon.  Good service reasonable price island atmosphere!"
test_2000,"Nothing special here. Coffee is decent, but whatever they use for espresso beans lacks bite.  Tastes more like a medium roast and does not leave that good aftertaste at the back of my tongue.

Combine this with unfriendly service and I'll just go elsewhere. The young ladies in here midday act bothered to take my four dollars. 

I won't bother them anymore."
test_2001,"This has been my family's optical place for years now, they have wide collection of frames and contact lenses. The people who works here are very nice and helpful. They accept most insurance as well. They're location is nicely situated at the district where there are numerous place to go to after your eye check up. The store hours is also convenient since they're open early and Saturdays as well!"
test_2002,"I might be bias... but I didn't enjoy the show. I think that for $45 a ticket, we would have been better off taking our girl to a male strip club where she would have definitely gotten a few lap dances and some drinks. The show is rated PG13 - half the time they were wearing clothes and were uncoordinated in their performance. If you're not front stage and center, your bachelorette will not be getting much action if any. If you're towards the very back, the most you can expect is a hug from one of these gentleman. This was my first and last time coming to the show. I would only recommend it for someone who wants to do PG13 to celebrate a bachelorette."
test_2003,"We stopped in for a quick bite before an appointment. Unfortunately that ended up our undoing. We had a lovely meal but it was served with a marked lack of enthusiasm on a very different timeline than ours. Hubby had an omelette that he said was absolutely delicious. I opted for an overpriced novelty drink and small side order of French fries. The menu looked promising. As a point of reference, check for the omelette, fries and my novelty drink without tip was $45.  With so many options around the hotel and the strip this wouldn't be my first choice especially if time is an issue."
test_2004,"I love Arizona State University.  It is one of my favorite places on earth.  You should love it too.

Sun Devil Stadium is glorious.  They are remodeling it so that it is even more spectacular.  

I can't wait until we win the PAC 12 championship.  We deserve it.  

The basketball arena is also cool.  The curtain of distraction is a brilliant piece of ASU pride.  

A-S-U A-S-U!"
test_2005,"Good kalbi, bulgogi, and choice of 3 banchan (side dishes, like kimchi). What else could you want? Mmm....."
test_2006,"Absolute terrible food prep and zero response from manager. Ordered take-out, one item being loaded fries. The container could not sustain the incredibly heavy weight of the food which also contained ranch dressing supposedly in a sealed side container. Upon opening the container of fries and dressing, the very very very hot food and dressing fell all over me leaving me with burns on my legs. Never realized ordering fries and some ranch dressing was dangerous. I highly suggest investing in containers that can actually hold the weight of the food and that the manager doesn't go into hiding when called and then hang up on you. Blue 32 is one place neither myself, family or friends will ever order from or go to again."
test_2007,"To the Silverton Casino Security Dept.: Hey Guys.....Cameras in cell phones are here to stay and so is Videoing big hits . . . . .  GET OVER IT & STOP HARASSING YOUR CUSTOMERS. If you don't want us to hang around and give the money back through further playing, then your accountant needs to wake up and fire your entire department"
test_2008,"Craving homemade cookies? You know, the ones that Grandma made, each bite sweet, crunchy, chewy, buttery? Call Nancy B's and order one of everything! Each cookie tastes like the best version of itself. Some places make one dough, adding in some chocolate for one flavor, cinnamon for another, all tasting the same. Not Nancy's! These cookies are HUGE! Party size available if you want a smaller treat. Plan ahead, call to order in advance and enjoy the buttery deliciousness!"
test_2009,"I went to Laservue to get a second opinion after being told that i am a good candidate at a different place. 
After taking the tests with the optometrist I was introduced to Dr. Marc.
He told me that since my vision is pretty good all around I should actually wait at least several years with the procedure, to the point where I will feel the need to start wearing reading glasses. 
I really appreciate Dr. Marc for the honesty and professionalism. It is rare that you go into these places and you feel like money is not the top priority. 
Kudows Laservue!"
test_2010,"This is the 2nd best sushi in Scottsdale, without being overpriced and over dramatized by $3 million decor, like most of the boring unauthentic restaurants in Snotsdale that snowboreds with money to burn go to get drunk. They have Japanese chefs, and they give you huge and fresh, oversized but correctly sliced fish on nicely groomed rice. You have to get here early, as it opens at 5:30 and fills up by 6. They have well prepared non-sushi dishes, too, and friendly service."
test_2011,So we got a chance to go to this restaurant via a Groupon. The wait for the meats were super long and didn't offer much salad bar and only a few guys were passing out the all the meats but the meats were amazing at the least. Very crowded and squeezed tables.
test_2012,"A wonderful local restaurant.  My wife and I brought our 3 yr old son. He played a bit in the play area.  We had a wonderful dinner.  We started with the Shrimp Cervice.  It was fresh, but lacked some heat.  Added some and it was fresh and delicious.  I had the seafood Paella and my wife had the Coq au Van special.  The Seafood Paella was full of seafood and delictable.  I recommend it.  Wifes Coq Au Van was tasty and full of flavor.  She loved it also.  We capped it with a great cream puff dessert.  They make 95% of their desserts in house, not brought in. 

They have a pre fix 7 course Valentines day menu for $50 a couple!  Looks wonderful.    I downloaded a pic of the menu.

This seems to be a great local new restaurant.  Opened about 3 months ago according to Ash, our chef tonight.  Great food at a great price.  It was slow tonight, but they provided great service, as far as walking us to the door and saying thank you.  We will definitely  be back again."
test_2013,"We weren't really impressed. The service was fine, but the pizza wasn't very good. We got the Margharita and the basil was all wilty and dry. We probably won't go back even though we live within walking distance as there are better pizza places in town."
test_2014,Pleasant and rather clean atmosphere inside with a combo of booths and tables. A few tables on patio/sidewalk outside.  Service is efficient and perfunctory. Food is mild for spice level but did not ask to increase level since this was first visit. Glad I went and may return someday if in the area and hungry for Thai.
test_2015,"Ordered to go tonight. Food was delicious as always and service was great. There is no doubt the wait times to dine in can be long and even the wait times to place a take out order can be lengthy also, but truly worth the wait! Thank you Texas Roadhouse for making my family one amazing dinner tonight!!"
test_2016,"Had an extremely pleasant experience. Ortal and Sean we're both very personable in providing exceptional service at the Las Vegas locations. My girl and I both got burgers that were made to order and arrived almost immediately. Compliments to the chef in preparing the food as the taste and presentation were exceptional. Almost the second we sat we were able to order drinks and have them delivered promptly. Their attentiveness and timeliness was above and beyond expectations. This made for excellent hospitality. Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family! Thank you again for a great experience! Definitely recommend if you are in Vegas. If the weather is great, outside is a must!"
test_2017,"This is an excellent restaurant if you want to impress your date!
Very attentive service but not overly so, food was wonderful. I'm not a wine drinker but my companions loved the wine list. Get a reservation."
test_2018,"Larry came by and presented me with popular and cost effective options. An honest expert in this industry who also told me about less expensive ideas for my home, his company has many beautiful designs too and my dogs loved him."
test_2019,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this LA transplant in Vegas! I would even dare say that this location is just as good or is even better than their DTLA spot! The best part about this location is that if you come during down times, there will not be a wait at all! I stopped by around 2pm on a weekday, and there was no one in line! 

I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese (~$9). I waited a few minutes for my order as they cook it fresh. The sandwich was hot and melt in your mouth delicious with the cheese oozing out. I'm a big fan of brioche, and their brioche bun was perfectly soft with a little bit of a chewy outside crust! If you're really hungry, one sandwich might not be enough so maybe get another sandwich or their signature slut! 

When I'm back in Vegas and won't be making my way down to LA after, I will definitely be back!"
test_2020,"Awful awful awful. The coffee is awful. Ohhhh buuut they have a fire place, and some glass ceiling...it's so cozy! Fuck. It's awful. The ""barista"" said that she had ""no clue"" what type of beans they use as she ""made"" my espresso (with pre-grounded beans no less) through an automatic espresso machine. I'm not going to waste any more time going through this watery instant coffee tasting crap. If you want comparable coffee, go to Timothy's where you will save money as well.. For proper coffee in k town, hit up House. 

Maybe in Grand Prairie this place would pass..."
test_2021,"I cannot say enough about this place.  I live in Portland, Maine, small-town capitol of amazing restaurants, and I couldn't find a single fault here.

I was pretty wary when we walked up to the restaurant--it doesn't look like much from the outside and the decor is definitely nothing to write home about.  It's a very small dining room with apparently only one waiter.  My boyfriend doesn't speak French so the waiter translated THE ENTIRE MENU for us!  (I probably could have done without the explanation of what ravioli is, but so kind nonetheless.)  He could not have been any more accommodating.

We started with foie gras ravioli and brie--I was, frankly, shocked by the quality of the presentation.  The onion soup was the perfect size--a first-course snack with the clarity and simplicity of the best French food.

I had the duck (not in a jar) with a beet reduction, roasted vegetables and popcorn.  Again, the plate was gorgeous and the duck was cooked perfectly.  He had the lamb and it fell off the bone--no knife necessary.  We finished with lime creme brulee--delicate flavor, perfectly bruleed top. 

Of course, bring your own wine!  The bill was 80 for basically four courses for each of us--extremely affordable."
test_2022,"Excellent food, amazing ambiance and very friendly staff.  It really doesn't get much better than that.  This will definitely be a restaurant that we frequent."
test_2023,"From salesman Tom Salem to finance specialist Jon I was treated fairly and respectfully.  I am delighted with my trade and love my new Lexus!   This is is my 3rd  Lexus,  but my first purchase at the Arrowhead store. I will continue as a loyal Lexus customer but now loyal to Arrowhead as well."
test_2024,"Went here for a work luncheon so I was able to try several items.   The chicken nachos were very good.  We also had a hummus platter, candied bacon, chicken lettuce wraps, wings, and their spicy edamame.  Everything was awesome.  For my entree I had the bison meatloaf, which was also delicious.  Finished off with an open faced apple-huckleberry pie that was really good.  Service was excellent for our large group of about 25 people.   Everyone was friendly and made you feel welcome.  Definitely returning for their happy hour soon!!  Also you can bring your dog if you sit in the terrace area."
test_2025,"We order delivery from here weekly and always get their New York Style Cheese Pizza with Pepperoni. It's so delicious & fresh out of the oven every time! It's how I imagined TMNT pizza would taste lol! Goofy, but true... and I'm sure my kids would agree with me. There have been a few mishaps along the way, such as the time the delivery driver forgot the pizza (which was hilarious) but they've always resolved situations quickly and efficiently."
test_2026,"The times I have visited, the service is not really firendly, it feels rushed... you better know what you want if you stand in front the cashier.  The baggels aren't great, just OK.  I wish there was a pop and mom place near by like the one I used to go to in Gilbert."
test_2027,Average priced drinks. Younger crowd 19-23 y/o. Has a coat-check for $2. We went to see a band playing here from the East coast and that was enjoyable.
test_2028,Good place to just go and relax. Have a seat under a giant butterfly! Nice to have a well maintained park in the area. Lots of activities for all ages to have some fun.
test_2029,"I needed my annual eye exam and decided to try Focused on Eyes. I'm happy I did! It was a pleasant experience. I didn't have to wait to be seen, they were prompt in all areas, including reception area, and fitting of new glasses. Dr. Lucas gave me an extensive eye exam, answered all my questions and concerns and was very nice and professional. My eyes aren't too bad but in my aging process things are changing at a rapid pace and I found a place that I can feel confident in taking care of my eyesight and glasses needs for years to come! Thanks to Dr. Lucas and her team!"
test_2030,"Im a believer, no offering required. I had Jersey Mike's  Original Italian. Great flavor good size. I have not tried any hot subs yet but my guess is cold subs is their specialty. If you eat a giant sub be prepared to dvr all the sports games and reality shows you lie about not watching."
test_2031,"$16 for one drink.... enough said... I'm all for a good time, but man! What a rip off!"
test_2032,"My mom and I were walk ins just going to look through the dresses and they were able to accommodate us at a later time. We came back and were greeted with pleasant smiles from all the girls. Donna was my stylist and she was so friendly and helpful through the process, i showed her a picture of a style and she already had an idea going through her mind! After trying on a handful of dresses, nothing was really standing out, then she finally pulled the dress out she was thinking of! What do you know? It was THE dress!! It fit and looked as everything i pictured myself in my wedding dress! I can't wait until November when i get to wear it for my big day! Thank you Donna and the amazing team at Brilliant Bridal for helping me find my dress!!!!"
test_2033,Great food! Four stars for lack of customization and charging for every little thing like sauce and bread..
test_2034,"Look, I realize it's not cool to admit you like CPK. I'm OK with that, because they have one of the most crave-worthy salads ever: the tricolore salad, composed of spring mix and arugula with a light vinaigrette, huge pieces of shaved Parmesan, and chunks of tomato, all served on a warm Parmesan-encrusted pizza crust. I think the whole thing really defeats the purpose of a salad, but the hell with it. Finish off the gluttony with their flourless chocolate cake, served warm with vanilla bean goo on top. OMG heaven."
test_2035,"Coup de foudre pour cette p√¢tisserie!! 3 petit-d√©jeuners a montreal, 3 petit-d√©jeuners chez kouign aman! Quand on entre c'est tout petit, presque toujours bond√© et ca sent super bon! A l'arri√®re plan, vue sur les p√¢tissier(e)s en plein travail, le caissier est adorable et dr√¥le et les p√¢tisseries: d√©licieuses!! Nous n'avons pas test√© le caf√© donc je ne peux rien dire sur le sujet. Seulement 3 tables donc a chaque fois nous avons patient√© 5-10minutes pour nous installer mais ca vaut la peine et il y a une bonne rotation!"
test_2036,"Average mcdonalds never done me wrong aside from the occasional mishap or wrong order. I will be honest the review about someone at the drive thru with a gun freaked me out a bit, but so far I haven't been shot so we are good to go."
test_2037,"This buffet was not good, the food was heavily salted and ultimately unappetizing. For being at a hotel on the strip where the competition is most likely fierce I would expect better. The hotel however did have a promotion which included the buffets with my room, which was nice because I payed absolutely nothing for my meals."
test_2038,"Went here for a friend's birthday so we had the group menu. We tasted 11 things overall and everything was flavourful and different, I was super impressed! The patatas bravas were a huge hit. 

Service was professional, friendly and efficient.

The vibe is classy but not pretentious, fun for a date night or with friends!

Overall, one of the best meals I've had quality/price-wise in a long time."
test_2039,"Great location, selection, lucky tickets, and friendly staff!!!  Check out Tranquil Waters Botanicals Kratom from local Cleveland company for all natural energy and pain relief."
test_2040,"This is another massive Las Vegas hotel/casino resort. Beautiful building and property. I find this place only OK with me. Lots of places to eat and shop.
 I am not a fan of their casino. Too bright, too tight, and too noisy.

Cheers to all"
test_2041,"Wow, what a let down. After everything I'd heard about this place, I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, everything looks really, really cheesy here and is about as similar to Venice as getting grocery store sushi is to living in Tokyo. The whole place just saddened and underwhelmed me. Combine that with the fact that they used to have a full on tiki bar that they recently gutted to turn into an ordinary douchebag bar and I've got nothing but contempt for the over-rated Venetian."
test_2042,"This place has destroyed any and all desire I have to rent a movie from a real-live store. I can order movies on my TV, but we'd go to Rogers to get Blu-rays... honestly though, it's just not worth it. The store is pretty much empty and has been for months like they're just not replacing what they're selling... I'm not sure if they're closing or just slowly getting rid of movie rentals all together. 

Worst of all, despite having a ""dedicated"" line for tv/cell phones/internet sales, a cashier in the movie rental line will spend forever showing some idiot how their new cell phone works as if there is no lineup behind them while two other employees pretend to look super busy jostling around returned DVDs in the background... all while you wait in line for 15 minutes just to rent a friggin' movie.

UPDATE:

My new phone day (I was eligible for an upgrade) was seriously marred by being in the Rogers Store for over an hour. They have gotten rid of all the movies and put in chairs. They are now putting in an espresso bar. 
Rogers - people do NOT want to hang out in Rogers all day. You are not the Apple store. As soon as you walk in there is a guy with a list and you get your name on ""the list"". 
If you go to this Rogers to pay a bill, you still get your name on the list and it is a 15-45 minute wait to pay a bill. Everytime I am there, there is a senior citizen yelling at them about waiting half an hour to pay their bill."
test_2043,Linda was awesome! Super helpful !  I'm a local and will definitely be back ! Store was clean and very inviting!
test_2044,"Went on a Wednesday which was Italian night and they offered ""bread/rolls, salad, pasta dish and ice cream"" for $12.99. We sat outside and had a view of the fountain going off. There was someone smoking while eating outside which we weren't a fan of- but that's not the restaurants fault, and we were far enough away from them we couldn't smell it. The proportions were big and tasted decent! The service was good- our waitress was very nice. Quick service too. We had our salad and rolls at the same time, and got our main dish before finishing our salads. They have happy hour on drinks as well."
test_2045,"The best things comes in small packages; Lou's diner is not big but they sure do bring out large flavors in their food. Eating at Lou's..I never left home! Please don't just look in the window, go inside and experience the atmosphere the service and the great food, they will make you a part of their family!"
test_2046,"Quick, friendly and informative. My first time ever receiving chiropractic service & I felt relieved after my alignment but was told I'd feel a little sore the next day. I will be back"
test_2047,"I cannot get enough of this place. Before I left for a year abroad, one of the employees started to recognize me and would remember my pizza when I'd come in. As you could probably tell, I've been here a lot. I just never got around to writing a review until now, a few years after my first visit.

When I tell people about this place, I usually tell them ""It's like Subway, but with pizza."" You can choose one of their menu pizzas, or you can make your own (which I love)! I get a chicken alfredo pizza from them regularly (white crust, garlic+alfredo sauce, parmesan, mozzarella, and chicken, if you're curious), and it's just amazing. I could eat it every day.

If you like pizza, give it a try! You can decide what you want, so it's hard to be disappointed."
test_2048,After dining at STK this was a perfect spot for after dinner drinks.  Before we entered there was a gentleman handing out drink tickets.  If memory serves it was for a two for one special but that only covered well drinks.  The lounge is large with intimate seating and on the dark side as far as lighting goes.   The music was not too loud that our group was not able to converse comfortably.  The waitress was attentive.  And the bathroom was in the lounge which I appreciated because quite a few lounges and restaurants on the strip you have to leave the venue to use.  The drinks are pricey!  $18 for my Carrot Cake martini but it was so good I had three of them!   I mean you can't go wrong with a drink rimmed with butter cream frosting!
test_2049,"I came here with some coworkers and had the chicken shawrma combo/plate that came with rice, potatoes and a mixture of salads.  It costed just over $10 including tax.  

What I liked:
-They have more salads than your typical Middle Eastern place and it's fresh.  They have 5-6 different types of salads.
-Your combo comes with potatoes, salad and rice
-The beef shawrma was quite tasty.  

What I disliked:
-Pricing is very confusing. They have like 3-4 combo's of what seemed to be the same thing.  
-It's slightly dirty or at least very messy.  
-Seems pricier than your normal Middle Eastern joint

Verdict: It's decent food and fresh, but I think it's kind of pricey for the amount you get."
test_2050,"Perfect hang out bar, especially during the warmer months when the front opens up. Wednesday night karaoke is always a good time and the staff is super friendly. One of my personal favorites."
test_2051,"I travel to Champaign Urbana frequently on business, this is the only hotel I will stay at.  What it may lack in outward appearance it more than makes up for in cleanliness in providing a safe environment and a wonderful staff. The owners live on site -- they're a wonderful family and gracious hosts.   In my opinion this is the safest hotel in the area. I've never had my car dinged in any way and I've never had any difficulty whatsoever unlike many places I stayed over by Neil street or in the more commercial areas. The location is central, it has a very large parking lot and the hosts are very very accommodating. I highly recommend nd enjoy staying at this hotel."
test_2052,"I just want to say that this has been the best Texas Roadhouse I have been to in the valley, I usually go to Peoria and the Goodyear location, this is by far the best, my waitress could have been a bit more on top of things and our order but let me tell you they have a manager by the name of Megan, she is awesome.. Really cares about her job as a manager and makes sure by going around to all tables asking if everything is ok with a smile, like it says on her shirt, I can tell she really loves her job, good job Megan keep it up"
test_2053,"First Markham Place is a lesser-known mall (when compared to THE Pacific Mall -- the shopping mecca I could literally spend days in if time had permitted.) That's not to say FMP doesn't have its own perks. Fewer shoppers meant less time spent waiting in line and a less claustrophobic feel; you get the gist. Most of the stores and types of store found inside PM can also be found in FMP -- give and take some price and layout modifications here and there.

Kiosk owners are extremely friendly and willing to negotiate prices. As a non-business student, if I can get away with some pretty nice deals, you can too. FMP also offers a myriad of dining options (again, paling in comparison to what PM has to offer), but I can guarantee that you'll find at least one place you'll like and pledge loyalty to.

What FMP offers that PM doesn't, however, is the homey feel especially during the major holidays. Crowds were gathering by the food court area to see a group of kids perform Teresa Teng's 'Moon Represent My Heart' when I was there. How's that for a change from the hustle and bustle of PM?"
test_2054,"This place is such a pleasant surprise. I'll admit I had zero expectations for the dim sum cafe just based on the name and location.  However, it's so yummy! 

True...you may miss the ambiance of traditional dim sum. There's no steaming carts rolling around. You simply order and your food comes from the kitchen. The major advantage to this is everything comes up fresh and hot! The menu is clear and easy for any novice with pictures and prices. 

They have all the classics and favorites and they are done well! They have specials as well to keep things interesting. 

There are fish tanks in the wall and it's big and open inside. Service is friendly and sufficient. I have yet to see it packed so you can sit and eat right away. 

Dim sum on the west side for the win!"
test_2055,"This is a great local neighbourhood pub.  Its usually pretty busy and parking in the lot can be a little bit of a problem at times, but there is lots of street parking.  They've got some games, a pool table, and darts.  What more do you need from your local pub."
test_2056,"The waffle n pancake are good. That's all I can say. No, I wasn't impressed. Lack variety n imagination. Went there again for lunch the next day cos I really want to find out why would so many TV program touted it as 'the ' buffet in Vegas. Nope,  still couldn't figure it out. The sirloin looked dry, so I avoided it. Shrimp tasted like it came out of one those ready cooked bags. Dessert was uneventful."
test_2057,"Went for a business trip. Awesome food...the best pastries I've had. Not a casino fan, but went to the Phantom of the Opera and was really nice. Don't miss the Venice canal!
The 3 stars are because people smoke everywhere!!! I hated that"
test_2058,"The food was Terrible, everything seemed frozen and reheated in a microwave. I went for brunch so I tasted their breakfast it was disgusting and their lunch was the same. Not too much to choose from and what they have is not worth it not even the desserts were good. Don't waste your money here go to the one in Cesar palace is more expensive but it's so worth it you won't be sorry. This ones just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth"
test_2059,"The staff and the doctor were amazing: they were very warm and accommodating, made sure to inform you about all the fees, took care of the hassle of contacting your insurance, and made sure to facilitate a transfer in case you needed a specialist (like I did since I needed a wisdom tooth removed ASAP)"
test_2060,"Saw this show this last weekend with the entire family. Good show for a young family, very entertaining a little on the short side.  Well written, with nice touches of humility and philanthropy.  Family friendly"
test_2061,"Found tickets to the last performance of ""Les Miserable"" online before we left, and so we ordered them to celebrate our first full day this summer in Arizona, even though I had seen the show already once this summer and in fact 25 times before that one.  Interestingly enough, I did something that I have never done in my fifty years of attending theatre--showed up for the wrong performance!  We had ordered the matinee on Saturday--we like matinees-- but I had written it down wrong and had not checked the tickets, and we showed up for the evening performance.  No one even looked at our tickets at the door so we sat there on the aisle reading our program, and five minutes before the show was supposed to start, another party came down and said we were in their seats!  And we were!  I went back to the people at the door who had given me the program but not checked the ticket, and they said we could sit in the back section--really only a few rows behind where we thought we were.  The show was great as always--although it was probably a bad choice because the production we had seen last month in Valdosta was so superior, and we were sitting on the front row there instead of a few rows from the back of the house in this large auditorium.  I still loved it,  but we had been spoiled, not to mention the ""haboob"" which had accompanied us on our trip to the theatre (I didn't know the word either, but a local explained it was a strong dust storm, often with whirlwinds, which we were experiencing for the first time.)  The show was obviously community theatre  but well done--it is hard to mess up ""Les Mis.""  Madame Thenardier was especially memorable!  The venue was new and very impressive, but the volunteers need a little training."
test_2062,"First experience and came for lunch with hubby. Ordered the traditional pork buns stuffed with ground pork and green onion, juicy pork steamed dumplings, pan fried meat dumplings, crispy dumplings with chives and egg, baked scallion pancake (a but doughy), fried rice with shrimp sausage and fish roe. Everything was generally tasty and love  ambience and decor. Would come back for dinner next time with family to try their geoduck, lobster and desserts."

Great way to add a little ""delight"" in your afternoon while exploring the ""Koreatown North"" neighbourhood :)

test_2064,"It seems the previous reviews were expecting a fine chinese dining experience.  I like buffets, but I don't expect them to be great.  I like being able to try many different items.  For these reasons, I enjoyed my meal at the Pacific Buffet.  The sushi items were better than any buffet I have been to.  I enjoyed the cream cheese wontons, the sweat and sour soup, the fried pork, and the shrimp dishes.  The deserts were dry and flavorless.  I didn't know I had to pay for my drink, but the tab still only came out to be $8 and change for lunch.  I did not leave room for the mongolian wok.  Will try it next time.

If you come with reasonable expectations, you will enjoy."
test_2065,"I'm honestly shocked this location does not have at least a 4 star rating average. We arrived at the Advantage counter at the McCarran Airport Car Rental and fell in the short line, which surprisingly moved rather quickly. Since we were there on our weekly annual family trip, naturally we had a lot of luggage to accompany us.  Our customer service representative, Ali was extremely friendly, helpful & more than accommodating. He went above and beyond and was able to track down a newer Chrysler Pacifica for us that had very low miles. The vehicle was perfect for our family and exceptional on gas mileage (it may have been a hybrid). 

Sincere thanks to Ali for the smooth and pleasant experience. Advantage should be thankful you're a part of their team. We will be back!"

test_2067,Vinny makes the best New York style slice that I have found here. It is definitely a classic restaurant so if you like the old school/traditional vibe this is a must. I tend to eat clean but when I'm craving some pizza this is the only place I will go to!
test_2068,"Sentimental location for me, having eaten and studied here more than 15 years ago and still able to come in for pancakes and remember those days long ago.  I don't care about those who park here and go to the dorms and what not, even for a short period of time.  This is for IHOP customers only, and I'm one pissed off customer if I have to deal with parking issues just to eat.  So if you're inconvenienced to go across the street to your dorm then I don't care.  I'm glad you got towed.  I'm laughing right now, enjoying a drink and laughing at you and your towing bill and frustration.

This IHOP is as good as any other and they offer discounts to students and faculty on weekdays.  Not a bad deal."
test_2069,"The abundance of decent, run of the mill hakka chinese options is overwhelming to say the least. For someone looking for authentic halal chinese food, Chinese Halal restaurant is a saviour. 
Happened to go there on a cold and dark December night for dinner. The very thought of the comfort of a steaming bowl of noodle soup on such a night was hard to resist.
Ordered the bbq lamb skewers and bbq king oyster mushroom. The lamb was a little chewy but the spices on the bbq skewers was delicious. The mushroom on the skewer was tough. 
The best order of the night was the lamb dumplings. Came steaming hot. Juicy and flavourful. The home made noodle soup with lamb was wholesome and satisfying. 
The service was quick and friendly."
test_2070,"We came in around 1 this afternoon, I tried calling them while walking around to see if they had the flavor I wanted--they didn't answer, so I assumed it was closed. Anyways, we walked in and it was pretty busy. I kind of felt like I was pressured to order even though I was still looking at what they had and the flavors they offered. There wasn't really a true line, so I was like ok, umm, I'll take the strawberry and cream. They should post the daily menu or something on a large board somewhere so everyone can see what's there.

The gelatos were good, we had 3 scoops for 3 people and it came out to like $11? That's actually cheaper than I thought it would be. The scoops were fair. There was only one regular table in the place, and like 3 large couches with tables in the center. 

Honestly, upon reading reviews I was expecting a little bit more. But, I think I'll stick to Art of flavors for gelato."
test_2071,"Do not go here..definitely a scam artist. I brought my car there because they had free towing. The repair cost me $500, and they told me that my breaks needed fixing and that would cost an additional 500. I denied the breaks for now because I couldn't afford it. When I left my rear lights weren't working which wasn't a problem before so I brought it back. This time they told me my breaks would only cost 60...hmmm. They got the lights working, but the next day they were out again. I brought it to a different repair service and they told me they circuited the fuses wrong, but so they would appear to work temporarily. Waste of my time and money."

test_2074,"Great plays, great productions, excellent acting.

Vegas may be known for the over-the-top, spectacle extravaganza gigantic show, but Insurgo is consistently offering the best theater in Vegas.  The plays they choose are thought-provoking and entertaining and they are staged in an small, but interesting space in Commercial Center.

They say that  hungry artists produce the best work.  Based on the brilliance of the Insurgo plays I've seen, the cast and director must be starving."
test_2075,"This does not resemble a butcher shop. Not clean, very poor lighting. You should be able to see what you are going to purchase

test_2077,"Sometimes I wake up just really craving some Korean food. 

I'm glad i found his spot not to far from my home!! 

Went in yesterday and ordered my self a bibimbap. I don't know why but I absolutely love the idea of a rice and toppings inside a ridiculously hot stone bowl.  Maybe it's all the crispy bits of rice that form at the bottom. 

Only thing I didn't like about this place you are limited to 2 sides of banchan (at a time?) I don't like having to choose sides. 

I will be back though and very soon!!"
test_2078,"The first thing you need to know about this place is it is geared towards families with kids, they always have birthday parties going on and they have games in the back where you can win tickets and trade them in for prizes, so if you don't like eating around kids, avoid this place right off the bat. 

I would imagine this place is great for said parties and families. I have no idea what kind of service they provide for parties, so if that is what you are interested in ignore this review. 

I don't have kids but I do enjoy pizza. It was around 3pm on a Saturday so I figure we were probably in between most larger parties. There were still several families already eating and kids running around but nothing terribly crazy. 

Ordered a large pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni. You order at the counter and they give you a buzzer, when it goes off you go up and pick up your food. I liked the pizza, it had thinner crust (but not ""thin crust"" style) and even though it was basic, sometimes that is exactly what I'm looking for. Nothing gourmet, nothing fancy, just some good old pizza that isn't from papa johns or Pizza Hut. I definitely think this pizza is better than that, but it just depends on how you like your crust. 

Overall a nice casual place for easy pizza. But be prepared to be around families and don't expect anything fancy."
test_2079,"I had a life changing experience today and that was of Hamachi Kama.  For quite some time now, after watching food programs that showcase Tuna collar, I have been dying to try it.  So in my research of finding restaurants that serve such this item I stumbled across Sakana.
   From my first bite, I was in love.  The Hamachi lived up to its reputation!  A nice size piece of fish, grilled to perfection.  I devoured this dish and could ate about two more servings of this.  I also ordered some sushi pieces as well.  The sushi was standard issue.  It wasn't mindblowingly good, but it was not terrible.  It totally satiated my appetite.
   The inside is a quaint and cute little place.  I'd say it would probable sit around 50 people.  The decor, is nothing too fancy, but it's not bland either, just the right mix.  They offered several different lunch specials and the portions were huge for the price.  Also they have two lists of special appetizers.  They have several items that are $.50 cents each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  And they have several items that are $1.00 each if you order a bottle of Kirin beer.  That's nice if you're curious to try something new.  What's an extra either 50 cents or a buck?
   All in all, just go for the Hamachi Kama.  I will be back for sure just for this one item!"
test_2080,If you're talking about the food I give it a 4 very good similar quality you would get at a Popeyes or a KFC and really kind family owned staff. They have a 4.44 deal which comes with fries and 2 pic chicken. My friend got the chicken sandwich and it was HUGE AND TASSY AND FRESH! I would go here  again
test_2081,"In short, this place is amazing! Everything I ordered was delicious; with crazy fast service! Just do it."
test_2082,"Only go here if your animal is in dire need in the middle of the night. I went on Saturday night with my puppy and paid $150 approximately to see the vet/emergency. We saw the vet for less than 5 mins. She had no answer as to why my dog was sick but did suggest we spend about $800 to keep her overnight for observation and some random tests.... Maybe $1000 isn't that much to some people, but to me it is. If it was a life and death situation then sure I would help my dog out in any way possible. But she said my dog may be suffering from low blood sugar (easily treatable) or some kind of allergy... Why does that warrant an overnight $800 stay? I just took my dog home and monitored her myself. I will think twice next time about going there. My doggie is doing well now by the way."
test_2083,"We came here thrice during our two-night stay in Vegas. Was it really that good? I've had marvelous pizzas before! But something about the choose-it-yourself, 10-minutes away from wood-fired to golden delicious pizza cheesy heaven...

No is just not an option. So thankful there's a location in Westwood!

The ingredients here are vast, fresh, and eclectic. They have anything from your basic mozzarella, feta, olives, marinara, and mushrooms to pesto, basil, jalape√±os, red chili peppers, and asparagus. 

They even have killer salads. Basic Caesar is just done right here--has the perfect amount of lightly tossed Romano Caesar dressing brushed with freshly grated Parmesan. 

And they have just-for-you portions. As a small, slender girl, I was able to polish off my own pizza A-ok, no problemo."
test_2084,"Had dinner at Fred's last night.  I like the design, and a big window overlooks Scottsdale road.  Feels like being in a big city.

Advice - talk to the sales staff in the store on your way in, mention where you are headed (or mention you are considering Fred's) and they may give you a card for a free glass of wine.

It was good - expensive, but not terribly overpriced given the location.  The menu had lots of good choices - we had rigatoni with broccoli rabe recommended by the bartender, and the salmon - both were very good.   The salmon was cooked perfectly - I give them props - ever so slightly charred on the outside and moist on the inside.  When I cook salmon its usually soggy on the outside and dry on the inside.

Here's my two complaints:

I thought the wine list was overpriced.  But I always think the wine list is overpriced.  If I pay $10 for a glass of wine, it should be better than the $6.99 bottle I get at Trader Joes - they rarely are.

And, in Phoenix in July, a glass of water should be automatic - it wasn't last night.  I asked twice, and never received one."
test_2085,"We came to Chianti on Tuesday August 2nd, arrived approx 6:00pm - expecting a long line up.  We got seated immediately - it was very busy as it is $8.99 pasta night.  Service is quick and friendly.

We ordered the bruschetta - and WOW ...  waaaayyyyy too much garlic.  I took 1 bite and couldn't eat it, unfortunately.  My friend ate it though - he got through it.  Wish the bruschetta was served with a baguette instead of focaccia, but that's just a personal preference.

I ordered cheese filled ravioli with bolagnese sauce (not on the menu but an easy request),  My friend ordered a veal filled tortellini with a cheese sauce (off the menu).

The raviolis were not cooked long enough - too hard - they went back.  Tortellini was delicious.  My second plate of ravioli came back and it was cooked perfectly.  It would be nice if there was a meat filled ravioli on the menu though, because that's what I was really in the mood for.

I will definitely come back - I won't order the cheese ravioli though - will try something else.

In closing...  I will say that it is nice to see such a BUSY restaurant!  The Calgary economy is in the dumps so seeing restaurants busy and succeeding is a very happy sight!  Good job Chiantis!"
test_2086,Took a 8x10 carpet and a long runner in to be cleaned.  They came back in one week perfect.  Price was reasonable and I'm quite satisfied.  Will go back to Apex again.
test_2087,"Best diner I've have eaten at, in two weeks staying right next door i have tried the country fried steak, cheeseburger with onion rings, chicken strip with fries and everything was delicious and couldn't be fresher.

I've eaten at Dennys and other diners where I leave feeling g like I wasted my money on crap food but not this place. Great jobs by the cooks, you guys are great at what you do. I can't wait to get out of work tomorrow so I can stop by and try something new."
test_2088,"Before I get into the food, the atmosphere is the first thing that catches your eye obviously. It's set up like a cross between a 50's diner and a casino lounge. The waitresses are dressed the part, too. 

My wife and I got there on a Monday morning around 10 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. And the food... restaurants always claim to have ""huge portions."" This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too. 


Another bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely go out of our way to stop here a"
test_2089,"Roto-Rooter is always good when you need someone right away.  You can typically schedule an appointment for the same day.  I had them take a look at my leaking toilet because they took appointments after 5 PM.  The plumber arrived on time and seemed to know what he was doing.  He diagnosed the problem, and quoted $265 for labor only to replace gasket.  Replacing the gasket involved removing the tank, swapping the gaskets, and re-installing the tank.  When questioned the cost, he described the work as, ""a full rebuild"".  I also asked him to quote me a price for replacing the entire toilet.  He quoted $318 labor only to remove and install a new toilet.  I ultimately decided to replace the toilet since we have had ongoing issues with leaking.  I found another reputable local plumber that replaced the toilet and disposed of the old one for $125.  Beware if you use Roto-Rooter.  They are always available right away, but you could argue that they will rip you off."

test_2091,I had major grease stains and odor from a food spilled in my backseat and I messaged for a quote the same night. I got quoted for $135 for interior detailing and an additional $25 for a basic interior wash. I booked an appointment through text which was super convenient. I booked it for two days later on Sunday and they even offered to do it sooner but I wasn't available. Sunday morning I received texts to update me on their arrival. Once they arrived they were super professional and they gave me a overview of what would be done after I showed them my areas of concerns. An hour later the stain was out and my truck looked the best it ever had inside and out.
test_2092,"I rented a property from this company by far the worst company any one can ever rent from. Please I repeat Please don't rent from this company. I was a very good tenant always paid my rent on time never had any issues with any of my neighbors. I am a single mother of three, so just imagine every penny counts. Not only did my request when something was broken never got replace or fix, they also never communicated back in letting me know the update, they stated I quote"" If you don't here from us in couple of days call us back"" what type of company runs business like this... The main point where I want to get is after my lease was done, they offer me to stay but to they would increase my rent, witch I denied the renewing of my lease, I gave my 30 day notice as they requested in paper and delivered it personally in the new office in Riverside. When I did my walk through the gentle men was very respectful and pleasant, I was informed from my total of 1575.00 I was only going to be deducted 40.50. They stated and also shows in paper they have 21 days to send me my check, that was a lie its been 28 days and yet I haven't got my check, not only have they once again neglected there customers but I was then told I was charge for doing my walk through on the 1st of May. What A SCAM!!!! No where in my lease agreement states that I would get charge one day stay if I did my walk through on the 1st. when my lease was done on April 30th,2015. I would never recommend this company nor ever rent from them again, I am also looking into taking this company to court."
test_2093,"Although my remaining extractions were the easiest EVER, the thousands we spent were a complete waste 
Although they have good marketing and we saved to make this my reality...
And since it has been a nightmare
Not only a horrible fit , that caused numerous mouth sores and scaring. The teeth jetted out (I was told 20% is ""natural"" .... Not if it doesn't match my gum line!
After months and months and numerous visits, We were told we wanted something for nothing..... Ummmmm NOOOO just what we paid for
FINALLY they agreed to redo and in the interim did an alignment... At last RELEIF  from pain, got the new set and although it now was a match to my mouth and looked natural.... But the mouth sores began again.
Each visit was met with the same lecture and often double teamed. It was beyond exasperating. Constantly told what I was doing wrong and my concerns fell on deaf ears. After 10 months of total frustration the doctor accused me of recording him.... I should've so he could hear himself talk,over me. I demanded they do an alinement, they did the bottom and didn't smooth it out and being after hours I called it a day.
I sent a message it was exactly what I needed and needed to do the top and smooth out bottom.... No response, receptionist even sent a reminder and the Dr still did not respond
Today... Numerous mouth sores and new scaring 
Would have rather gotten 5 affordable denture sets than the anguish I've been through with GLOBAL

UPDATE

My husband used a tool from his bowling equipment and fixed the upper.... No more sores, but the bottom they had butchered so he couldn't do anything with it"
test_2094,"Where the heck did this place come from?  It's so hidden!  Fortunately, my eyes are piercing and eagle-like; as long as I wear my contacts I guess haha!  

Sushi was real tasty especially from a non-sushi eater like me.  I'm a big fan of octopus -- YUM and I love the lemon atop.  The rolls were okay; it didn't really make much of a difference.  It was somewhat of a reverse HH when I attended; buy a large Kirin and appetizers were only $1.  In that case give me 2 I say!  

The place is small and low key.  Great place for a chat and not too loud matter of fact.  Next time I come I have to sit at the bar!  Say Hi to sushi Chef Jay he'll take care of you!  

Service was quick, they definitely had a lot of servers for a night like Tuesday.  However, I can appreciate that - quick service, quick food, quick turnover, and quick cash! - Enjoy!"
test_2095,This is a cute spot with good wood fired pizza with some Italian influence. My husband and I split a pizza and salad. The Italian Stallion pizza was a must try for meat lovers. The spinach salad was also yummy! The pastas going out to other tables also looked delicious. We will definitely go back! Fun little date night spot in Old Town Glendale.
test_2096,"I can never go wrong coming to Jun's to satisfy a quick, cheap and pretty good Korean meal. I always order their kalbi which comes in 3 pieces of thinly sliced short ribs, rice, salad and their complimentary side dishes as a staple in any Korean cuisine. 

The kalbi has nice charred grilled marks. It also has a marination without the sweetness over powering the meat. The kalbi compliments well with a nice touch of acidity and a little sweetness from the salad dressing. The mandoo wrapper seemed thicker than other places,  but it does have a flavorful taste. 

The place is not that big, but still has a comfortable atmosphere feel without all the fancy decor. The staff and service are always great. This location about equals to their other location on Craig. Again, great place to dine in with good portion sizes to fill up my hunger any day of the week!"
test_2097,"600TH REVIEW!!! 

Had a pleasant experience here! The clerk helped me ship a package & got me the cheapest rate possible. She was very nice to me and others that encountered her. Most USPS clerks aren't the friendliest! But she was very accommodating. Kudos to her!!!! So glad I had a 5* experience on my 600th review."
test_2098,"Dos is our favorite spot. All the staff are awesome as is their food. They have great happy hour deals. I really like the Bloody Mary's and the breakfast burrito on Sundays. 

Dos Gringos rocks!!!"
test_2099,"Chenin Orthodontics is very well run. All of the staff members are so friendly, knowledgeable and patient. The office is kid-friendly and totally fun! Both doctors are amazing. Highly recommend!"
test_2100,"1.5 stars is OVER rated for this store.
 
The owner, Caucasian, will never say thank you when u buy something from his store. Moreover, i can feel that he doesnt want me to come back because i interrupted his sport games on TV, LoL.

Another owner, Vietnamese lady, like husband like wife, will stare at u once u walk in. I dont know why, may be, they moved from downtown Detroit with bad neighbors.

Their items are over priced. A bottle (16.9 fl oz) of soy sauce costs about $4.5, WTF!

Please give them a visit and confirm my GREAT experience."
test_2101,"Great sushi. I did not place an order on the phone, I just showed up and ordered. Service was awesome. I ordered the Panko crusted crab and shrimp/veggie tempura. I was in a rush so I just went with the Bento Box 30 (for 2). No complaints whatsoever it was very good. I hear their specialties are awesome will order that next time :-)."
test_2102,Amazing! The staff is so kind and goes out of their way. The resort is incredible. Our room was so nice. Parking is free and food is excellent!  We will definitely be back.
test_2103,"PizzaRev is a solid four stars for me! My family and I always look forward to coming here on Tuesdays for their $6 thin crust pizzas yaaaas!! I like the idea of these kind of restaurants where you can customize your own pizza and put whatever you want on it and however much you want on it! They have LOTS of different options here as far as sauces, toppings, and meat options. They do have vegan cheese, gluten free dough, and vegan sausage. 

My go-to pizza was actually recommended to me by the very funny bald man that was working. He said that his favorite sauce is the Alfredo and pesto mixed together, which sounds kinda weird but it is SO good. I prefer double dough over the thin crust because usually the thin crusts always come out with burnt edges. They also have an extensive hot sauce selection - my favorite is he peach vidalia and the chipotle one. 

The reason I took a star off was because service here is a hit or miss. Most times when I come in, they have been super friendly and funny. I'll never forget when the guy making my pizza said ""feta make it bettah"" LOL. But sometimes I come in when it's extremely busy and everyone just seems frantic and overwhelmed. I once saw that they lost a guys pizza and had to remake it. But other than that, $6 for a pizza is a steal especially for all the unlimited toppings."
test_2104,"The only way to ever engage in a loan of this nature is to pay it back asap, otherwise you get absolutely buried at a rapid pace!  I knew when my payment was my due, but still received several reminder phone calls which was rather off putting.  Bottom Line: They really don't like it when you pay off these loans off quickly.  I have a feeling they (employees) receive bonuses on interest paid etc.  The Girl that did my loan didn't like it at all when I said I was paying my loan off in its entirety.  She did nothing to get my payoff which I had to jump through hoops to finally receive.  They don't accept cash, and take their time on releasing your title.  Just not a big fan of this place.  The employees seem nice on the surface, but they're in business to capitalize on the misfortune of others.  It would be nice if they would simplify things by accepting cash as payment.  Isn't cash still king?"
test_2105,"I've never been a particular Beatles fan so I'm not qualified from that perspective. But I did very much enjoy the show.

Last year while in Vegas we saw KA and liked that quite a bit. I'd rate this slightly below that, but I was never bored for a minute.  There is an incredible amount going on and it's pretty surreal so:

A: Don't expect to ""Understand it.
B: Don't expect to ""See"" everything going on. (It's a circular stadium)

They have a restroom inside the auditorium, which is nice, so you can comfortably get your seat before worrying about finding a restroom.

If you are averse to large crowds you might feel a bit uncomfortable after the show as everyone queues out of the place.

Overall if you are looking for a Cirque show, this one is certainly well worth your attention."
test_2106,"This review is for the pharmacy in general and my pharmacist, Marc, in particular. Marc is amazing. He really cares about his patients, has great customer service, and always helps me (a grad student) save money on my prescriptions. I know this is so funny to say, but I really am very grateful to have him as my pharmacist. I just recently moved back to Tempe and I am so stoked to be able to visit this pharmacy again regularly."
test_2107,"Downtown Lumber is a one stop kitchen, fixture, tile and lumber supply centre located right downtown on Ossington Ave. After working there for over 5 years I would recommend this location for everyone in the area. 

Their showroom designed by Katarina Mijatovic of JNKM Design is a stunning example of modern and contemporary kitchen and washroom design."
test_2108,"Dear Chef Bruell,

It's time to come around to Parallax and check in on the dishes coming out of your kitchen. I'm serious. I even signed up for yelp to write this review just because I was THAT disappointed in the meal that I just had tonight. Yes, that's right, this is my first ever review - my apologies that it is a negative one. Since I have had many many wonderful meals in Cleveland that I could rave about - and will, just to even it all out. First off, we had salads, I was informed after receiving the goat cheese salad that it is your best selling salad. I can see that, but not to my taste. I had to really adjust to it - it was sweet and overdressed. The goat cheese itself was delicious - but who can go wrong with breaded and fried goat cheese? Still, are the cranberries and candied walnuts really necessary? To be really frank, everything tasted that way - overdone and over-thought.. My partner had the beet salad, it was dusted with blue cheese - there were a few large pieces - but most of it was this sort-of dandruff of blue cheese. It really looked terrible. The flavors worked together fine, though nothing special. Then the main entrees came and that's when the real trouble began. I ordered the swordfish. I'm still looking for it.  It was like a weiner schnitzel of fish - sashimi size. Poor swordfish. And technically it wasn't ""stuffed"", rather it was rolled. The stuffing was supposed to be crab and corn - it was more like breadcrumbs and a few kernels of corn. I honestly couldn't find the crab. Nor could I taste any of what was supposed to be in the dish because there was a ladle full of red pepper ""soup"" over the entire dish. Oh! and lest I forget the chard - overcooked and more like canned vegetables at the bottom of the plate that had been stewed to a point of mush. My guest had the walleye - where was the middle of it? The pieces of fish were literally two fingers in width. I'm not sure it's even legal to catch walleye that small. The fish was cooked perfectly - which is more than i can say for the swordfish. However, we did not order corn chowder with a crouton of walleye. The beans were the best part of the dish. How sad. 

I can't emphasize enough what a terrible meal it was. I'm sure there are folks out there that won't understand what I'm saying - and that's fine, everyone has different taste.  I don't need big portions, and I can handle unusual combinations. But nothing worked, and I felt overcharged for a meal that I didn't enjoy at all.  Truly your restaurant is currently completely over-rated. I hope you (and readers of yelp) take this to review to heart."
test_2109,"It's a shame. We really wanted to find a great place in South Chandler, but we'll have to keep looking. The one star is for the great location and patio. Aside from that, there's nothing.  Food was ordinary at best. Lackluster and overpriced. Service was awful. Manager was walking around but she seemed not to notice the unfulfilled drink and dinner requests all around. Since when has there been smoking allowed in restaurants?  Patron on the patio with smoke wafting in our direction. Food tasted even worse after that. Nothing seems to last in this location."
test_2110,Smash style burgers and plenty of fresh ingredients. Love the french fry medley! Food came out fresh and hot. Hit the spot....two days in a row!
test_2111,"I did curbside service and they left out part of my order and got part of it wrong. I had to go back for the missing items after being told they would call me back- after being on hold for a while when I called about it I wasn't reassured that I would ever be called back by a manager. I didn't bother to get the other part of the order fixed since by then it was more trouble than it was worth.

The food was good but the quality of service can be improved, especially when it comes to putting to-go orders together."
test_2112,"This place is fantastic! Really cool atmosphere, friendly service, and tasty food. We had the scallops, the shishitos, and then skirt steak. They were all excellent!"
test_2113,"This was my 3rd dining experience, but probably my worst and last. Restaurant was empty and server was far from friendly and accommodating! Never received a refill on beverage, I had to ask. She was tipped over 20% of bill in cash. I then had to ask another server for a to-go cup, and do you think she'd top off my drink? Nope. This place already has changed their opening hours, indicative of slow traffic. With poor service, it's surely not going to last long.

Canters CLOSED! BAM! I was spot on, saw it coming long ago."
test_2114,"I will not return to this place. They are stuck up and rude. Wouldn't even serve myself and my friends for being ""belligerent"" when we clearly are not (at 6:30p- AND I'm sober enough to write this coherently). I guess they aren't worried about sales if they will turn down a group of people (who are simply out to have a drink to celebrate) with only a handful of customers sitting in their bar. If they want to discriminate, that's fine. I will tell everyone I know not to go there for a drink."
test_2115,"I bought an expensive GPS from these people on ebay, right away I could tell it was not what I needed, the ebay auction stated ""free returns"" so I contacted them and returned the GPS the next morning. It was out of the box for no more than 10min and was returned it the exact same condition it was received in, you would not be able to tell it had been removed from the box, Well I waited 10 days for my refund and at the last min they sent a partial refund, they deducted 10% saying it was used. I contacted ebay and they looked at their feedback and saw this is something they do regularly, what ripoff's, ebay took the 10% from their account and refunded it to me. I wouldn't recommend dealing with these people if you don't have to, you do so at your own risk !! I wish I had read the reviews here on yelp first almost all 1 star !"
test_2116,"My dog loves camp.  She is ready at the door when it's camp day.  The camp counselors are friendly and you can tell they enjoy working with the dogs.  

We have a high energy German Shepherd, she gets to run and socialize with other dogs and bark and go play.  When she comes home she is excited and barks telling us about her day then comes the plop - she is worn out."
test_2117,"We decided to stay at this hotel for its modern and colourful design and also because they're dog friendly.  

What was good:
-really vibrant and friendly atmosphere.
-pretty satisfied with the over all cleanliness.  
-Wifi pretty fast
-Appreciate the complimentary things like coffee, shampoo & conditioner, dog bed

Some critique, 
-we booked early requested two rooms joined together, but didn't receive
- for our dog, we didn't get the  bowl, plus treats and toys as mentioned on the website
-when extra towels were requested, we were asked to come down to front reception to pick them up"
test_2118,"My review will focus on the Arizona State Fair, as I attended many events at this large fairgrounds: Maricopa County Fair, dog shows/adoptions, concerts @ coliseum, book sale, DeafNation, so forth (all with positive experiences).  I have attended the State Fair over the years with free admission and will be reviewing mainly this year's attendance...

I went to the State Fair last Thursday on the 22nd and took advantage of their free admission between 12-1, which saved me $10 (not counting discounts offered on other days), as well as avoiding weekend crowds.  I walked around and looked at various exhibits, mingled with livestock, purchased a couple fair souvenirs (postcards, pennants, photo taken w/ fair logo over the years), and ate a typical fair snack (funnel cake).  I don't go on rides so I won't be reviewing it.  I love photography so I took quality photos all over the grounds, just a little of most of day, evening, and night ones.  There's lots to see, but I didn't expect much knowing it's Arizona.  Just do a price comparison because it's not your typical fair prices so make sure to watch your spending.  Downstairs inside the coliseum used to have various vendors either to educate or sell something; nowadays, it's just one big themed exhibition that they change annually.  This year featured Vintage Sweets sponsored by Sears, showcasing various famous candies, gums, etc.: Wrigley's, how caramel's made, as well as selling various sweets (Jelly Belly, lollies,...).  Exhibit halls featured displays & the winning ribbons: food, craft, sewing, cake decorating, photography, even collecting rocks/minerals.  Live food shows with free samples given out, as well as various like hypnotist were done periodically throughout the day.  There is one other exhibit I usually avoid: junk selling junk and especially that would be more convenient to purchase elsewhere like a mattress(!)  My favorite being an animal lover is the livestock arena where you pet / walk with zoo (baby) animals, look at small show roosters, goats, as well as sit & watch 4-H live shows.  They even added sinks for you to wash all the germs off ;)  Sheryl Crow was this year's concert lineup for that evening, so I watched her in the evening before heading home.
I appreciate that fair officials have kept in the tradition of keeping the fair going on the same grounds annually since the founding.  The fairgrounds used to be a horse racetrack until they eventually built the Veteran's Coliseum and added the fairs (state & county) and then over time included other non-related events.  That's how the fairgrounds is kept successfully in business.  The rugged southwestern 'charm' is also what keeps the price down a bit and keeps the fair looking like, well a typical fair with the livestock & food scents wafting in the air.  Relocating would kill the vintage-y history and drive prices up even more at a new location.  I never drive & park there and use only the city bus where the stops are right in front of the entrance; parking is a bit expensive and my bus fare is free so I didn't have to deal with the high price and worry about what happened to my car in some sketchy neighborhood.  The fairgrounds and some restrooms were pretty much kept clean and litter-free and when litter/spills did happened, it got cleaned up ASAP.  Remember, the grounds is a large property with so many colorful fairgoers that the hired staff could only keep up with.  I prefer using the coliseum restroom.  The air conditioning inside the coliseum was bit on the chilly side, which is not good for the body when entering from the warm outdoors.  Bringing a light sweater for this could be an inconvenient to carry around, and also an umbrella due to limit shading all over.  I usually hang around inside buildings until the sun finally set for me to mill around outside afterwards.  As for the fairgoers in general, they pretty much keep to themselves so they didn't cost trouble and being that this is typical of Arizona, alot of them looked, umm, alarmingly unkempt.  Casual dressing for fair-walking comfort doesn't mean looking like you just got out of bed under an overpass and zoomed over to the fair without eating something or brushing your hair first.  Sorry, but ick.  I know the fair doesn't have a dress code (sans nudity / barefoot) and that it's not their fault for attracting these type of people.  It's...Arizona.  I didn't choose to move to Arizona (Mom's) so it's obvious.  However, for Sheryl Crow's show, some of the people who showed up at the fair exclusively to see her and not attend the fair did look nice.  Whew, there IS hope!
Despite the fair's positive and negative history over the decades, I still think it's a nice place to attend with the special people in your lives and just GO and have a good time with positive vibes and IGNORE the bad.  There's security patroling all over.  Just have FUN and don't quibble over the little petty eews- just GO and have fun and bring home memories!"
test_2119,"Green is A-OK with THIS meat-a-tarian.

First, let me tell you I'm not a vegetarian. I like bacon way too much and I have a hard time even liking vegetables. I went today for a going away lunch with a co-worker and so surprised at just how good Green was!  I admit, I was totally trash talking the mock-chicken before I had it. It just sounded weird. Pssshaw....""mock"" chicken. 

I'm just super excited about the fact that most of the bowls are gluten free except the Thai peanut. I got the coconut curry ""chicken"" and boy, was it tasty! They make it with tamari sauce instead of soy sauce, hence the gluten free-ness of the dish.

If I wasn't so full from the artichoke dip I would have devoured a soynami (vegan blizzard). They don't have any gluten ingredients in them either, except for whatever toppings you might toss in. It's pretty rare that I can go to a restaurant and eat 80% of the menu. What a treat!"
test_2120,"This place truly deserves five stars.  It is small super clean and modern caf√© that serves middle eastern kebabs and such.  The people there are nice and friendly.

So happy to say that the food was amazing.  The chicken kebab was perfectly cooked and flavored totally yummy!  The lamb kebab was very good as well!  The plates can be served with all rice or all salad or half of each.  The bread that's served with the dishes was also fresh soft and so good!!

There is a self-serve drink fountain.

I really can't wait to go back thank you so much!!"
test_2121,"Fantastic facility! We genuinely feel lucky to have this right downstairs, could not ask for a better quality of life! Movie theatre, basket ball, state of the art gym, bowling alley 
I feel spoilt living here and I like it!"
test_2122,One of favorite happy hour places in town. If you get the wings here it shouldn't matter if you get anything else. Great location and nothing else needs to be said. Maybe a renovation on the parking lot.
test_2123,"Really, really poor customer service. My wife purchased a shirt for me from Road Runner Sports on my VIP membership, but I was unable to exchange it after driving 30 minutes out of my way without a receipt. Why didn't they have a record in their system if it was purchased on a VIP account? I don't know, but this is a store I never want to set foot in again."
test_2124,"A seat yourself, cenPho authentic Mexican restaurant. A patron for over ten years and the food and service has not yet left me unsatisfied.  Friendly staff with great smiles, family- ran, booth or table seating, fun decor, good chips with delicious home- made salsas, a variety of delicious dishes, and speedy service.  Try the mole, barbacoa, albondigas soup or anything on the menu and you'll be fulfilled and content.  One con: no beer on tap."
test_2125,"I just took my 8 month old puppy to Boca Park Animal Hospital for her first check up.  The staff was beyond great!  The ladies at the front desk were so nice and welcoming, a great start to the appointment.  When we went back to a room, our nurse Raquel was awesome!  It's evident that she loves her job and all the animals there. She was so sweet with my pup, getting down at her level and giving her treats. She quickly got all the vitals needed and then spoke to me for a while about my dog and our family.  Eventually, Dr. Ensign walked in and spoke to me at length about their practice. He really took the time to make me feel comfortable, explaining everything that I had a question about. He spoke to me on a personal level, not just professional, which I appreciated.  He was absolutely great with my dog too! I had explained to him that my last dog died during her spaying.  He was so understanding and let me know of the great care they give the animals here, especially during a surgery.  This is the second vet I've been to in Vegas and I will never go anywhere else.  BPAH puts a lot of love in its facility and it shows. Your pet will love this vet!  I highly recommend!"
test_2126,"Came here with a friend who highly recommended this place.  He even ate here the day before taking us!

We ordered the buffalo chicken tacos, Korean beef tacos and the parmesan truffle fries to share.  I gotta say the fries were amazing!!!! I could eat them all day.  For the tacos I preferred the Korean beef ones more. It came with a type of slaw inside which was refreshing.  The buffalo chicken one reminded me more of a spicy mcchicken type of thing, but still good.  The great thing is that all tacos are only $8 everyday between 3-5pm. (Or maybe it was 2-5pm... Can't remember)

We will be coming back"
test_2127,"I am not a hot dog fan at all and I try to avoid eating them. However, this is the only place where I'd want to order more than one hot dog! There are so many toppings and sauces to choose from which is super fun. The food is delicious. Top your hot dog with a fried egg and order a side of tots and you'll be wanting more soon"
test_2128,Pretty legit steakhouse. Needs an extended happy hour.
test_2129,"Came here for a late Saturday dinner, and was ready to try their chicken. I know my way around fried chicken, and needless to say, I was excited. The ambiance and space inside is awesome, with a light fixture that you can't help but stare at. 

Lewellyn's Fine Fries Chicken - Very, very good. Crispy and so so moist. Great seasoning too. While KFC might tout its original herbs and spices, with this fried chicken you can actually taste those spices. Just a great classic fried chicken with a black pepper kick. Truly fantastic and a must-try. 

Macaroni & Cheese - Served in a skillet with melted cheese and breadcrumbs on top. Looked promising when it hit the table, but turned out to be quite dry, as if it were in the broiler too long and dried out the cheese. Great cheese blend, but should have been a bit more creamy. 

Skillet Cornbread - If there's cornbread on the menu, you best believe I'm ordering it. This was disappointing as well. It was more of a dense cake with sweet cream butter on top than actual cornbread. And since it was served in. Cast iron skillet, I expected a bit more crunch around the edges. It's a shame that it relied on extra butter to be good... The menu states that there's bacon in it, but in reality there's not enough to even taste it. In fact, I made it a point to find it, and all I could find was a sad little speck.

The service here is good, the fried chicken here is excellent, but the sides we tried were just average."
test_2130,"Been on a mission following triple D locations and was excited to make it here. Was such a big disappointment. Waited 15 minutes for the table, ordered, got drinks then our salads and food all came out together, on salad was wrong and was immediately replaced leaving me to believe there was no reason we couldn't have gotten our salads first. After that our server was gone, no checking on us, no drink refills, nothing! The food. Ceasar salad was bland and watery, croutons were good. Table split the rib plate. Daughter wouldn't eat the mac and cheese, it was thick and pasty. I was not a fan. Cornbread was DRY and had melted cheese on top? Ew. My portion of the ribs were good, the other two pieces were drrrryyyyyyy, the bark making it hard to chew and swallow. Bbq sauce is spicy and good. I wouldn't come back. Small menu, no kids menu and high prices for flashy food. Sorry guy, I still love you, just not your vegas kitchen."
test_2131,"This is one of my ""go-to"" places when I'm in Charlotte. I've always had a pleasant experience except the last time I went. They burned my roti canai (the roti) and by the time they replaced it, everyone else at my table already got their main meals. The waitress was not friendly at all and seemed to have an attitude when I told her my food was burned. All in all b/c of that one experience I take down a star but the food is always good.
Try the Kung Pao chicken or tofu!"
test_2132,"When my husband told me he was taking me to a oil and vinegar tasting, I was completely unexcited and thinking of so many other things I could be doing with my Saturday.

When we arrived, we were the only customers. So, we were able to have one of the staff members walk around with us and tell us about the different oils and vinegars, where they came from, what kind of foods to use with them, and which oils and vinegars complement each other.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer many brandy's, liqueurs, vodkas, and other spirits. 

This store isn't just about retail, it's an experience. 

I am bringing my best friend and mom up here next weekend and I can't wait!"
test_2133,Heard great reviews but it was just okay.  Loved our server bit atmosphere was lacking.
test_2134,"For those who think that all buffet's are the same, nothing can compare to the Buffet at Bellagio.. From Sushi to Salads to Prime Rib, nothing can beat it. Everything is there..The ambiance is classy and not cheesy Vegas."
test_2135,"Here's a convenient location to satisfy your cupcake craving! (Pun intended.) This Crave is located in the Crowfoot plaza so you can drop by for a movie, grab a meal, get your dessert, and shop for some sports apparel to work off those calories all in one go.

The cupcakes do sell out so try to go earlier. I went around 3pm on a Tuesday and everything was available but just an hour and a half later, only red velvet and the more expensive thanksgiving specials were left. 

They have pumpkin pie, apple spice, and pumpkin spice cupcakes right now. Grab one before they're gone until next year!

Mmm, cinnamon nutmeg buttercream..."
test_2136,"Ana! Very knowledgeable and informative chick plus she did an amazing job on switching my piercing due to a horrid infection. She gave me great advice on the healing process and now, 3 weeks later, my piercings are completely normal and feeling/looking as great as ever! I'm ditching my older piercer and only trust Ana for piercing advice and new piercings if I ever deiced to get another. If you ever have problems with any body/ear piercings I would always and forever now recommend Ana!"
test_2137,"We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding, and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner."
test_2138,"Service was much to be desired. Granted it was busy but it took a while to get service more than understandable. The flavour were what I was most upset about.

Chocolate scoops came in cups with a slice of waffles and the only thing that tasted good was the waffles. Chocolate ice cream tasted fake as if they had mixed in some cocoa powder for extra kick, though it wasn't quite mixed in. 

Price is normal for a typical dessert place but definitely not worth the price considering the taste and service."
test_2139,Phenomenal pizza! We eat here on a weekly basis and they never disappoint! TVs everywhere and great drinks!
test_2140,I had the pleasure today to go to Luv and let me tell you i have no regrets. I had the steak sandwich and it was soooo amazing!!!The staff had great costumer service and they were very attentive. The ambiance is amazing and I enjoyed myself and was able to relax.  The hookah was great as well. I highly recommend this place to everyone
test_2141,Great place to stop by after the bar.  I always get the same shawarma sandwich so I that's all I can recommend.
test_2142,"Gym = Okay
Price = Okay
Cancellation process = the most difficult, frustrating, irritating process I have been through with any gym.  

I processed the cancellation form with the gym, they did not cancel my membership.  I called the gym, they did not cancel my membership.  Life happens and a few months go by.  I call the gym again.  It takes them several days of digging to find my membership form, and they have not returned any of my money even after promising to and have also charged me additional amounts for the year renewal.  

Don't expect to be given more than the 3 months of your money returned (contractually obligated) either even though they've basically been stealing from you.  I don't call that ""Christian"", but it seems like they don't take that word too seriously.   You think you can trust the front desk person to hold up their end of the bargain....Nope, now they've dropped off the face of the earth.

All in all, I advise you to go somewhere else if you ever want to change gyms or intend to move somewhere else.


Pissed off in Mesa,
Courtney


I am actually writing this post in the hopes that they care about social media and will address these very obvious problems in their cancellation process."
test_2143,"Took my car in for service at Berge and had a horrible experience. This was the first time I have used the dealership and was completely disappointed with the whole event. Not only did they not repair my car properly they provided zero help in a solution. They were rude and took every opportunity to bad mouth the dealership i bought my car from. 

What should have been a simple CV boot repair has left me stranded with no car for the weekend and will either cost me a full day of work or the cost of a rental car. Not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service. 

I know VW is better than this, I have owned 6 VW's in the past 10 years, and in a bad economy this kinda of service will severely  damage a reputation. 

From now on I will drive the extra 50 miles round trip to have the service department at camelback VW work on my car. They have always provided awesome service."
test_2144,"The food is pretty good and so are the prices.  Compared to a lot of all-you-can-eat Japanese buffets, they DON'T overload their sushi with rice, which is good.  Also, their prices are pretty decent, not too expensive, especially for their lunch bento boxes.  Their service however, is not that good.  When my family and I went to eat, we had to ask for our bill three times before finally getting it.

The bottom line: I will come here again if I'm craving sushi or all-you-can -eat Japanese food despite the poor service."
test_2145,Good food.  Good service. Mouse scurrying across the restaurant floor. That was a bit of a downer on an otherwise good experience.
test_2146,"Consistently one of the better Thai restaurants I've dined in across many trips and many years in Vegas. Chada's dishes are a bit more ""creative"" and stand out in my favorites as so *@(@* good and I've never seen this prepared this way anywhere else! 

In fact, on my last trip to Vegas, I Lyfted from the strip to this location no less than 3 evenings for dinner.  Chada's attentive service staff have always been spot on as my water glass never ran dry.  My all time favorites dishes are:  
1) Nua Dad Diew an in-house beef jerky. If you like jerky, this is for you to try.   
2) Miang Pou - this dish is a star. It is served on carefully prepared lettuce  leaves, coconut, peanuts, crab, ... WOW.. I could have 2 of these and be in nirvana! 
3) Spicy Spring Roll - This is a good take on fresh spring rolls. I love the spicy components. 
4) Coconut and Sweet Rice - round out a meal

As for the wine selections at Chada, I am not a wine SME.  My preference are whites and mostly Eiswein or desert wines.  What I can report from this visit is what I heard from a table nearby. They were quite ""impressed"" with Chada's wine selections and by the end of the meal, they had finished 2 or 3 bottles.  

Before other posters rib me on, ""... What about the other 3 or so other very good Thai restaurants in Vegas?""  Yes, I've eaten at most all of these and I shuffle between them.  Yes, you cannot go wrong at those or at Chada if you are in mood for Thai.  Reservations are always recommended, especially on weekends and it's an easy Lyft from the strip. Peace, Later."
test_2147,"This place is geared towards health conscious diners.  I wasn't a big fan of their take on beef shawarma, it seems more like beef stir fry in a pita.  That said, the pita was very good and overall I enjoyed the flavor.  Also had the hummus which was a refreshing appetizer."
test_2148,"They say they deliver, but they DON'T... Menu states that they go to Happy Valley over to 83rd avenue, but if you don't live ON Happy Valley Rd or 67th Ave they won't deliver to you. They state that apparently the one side street off of happy valley is too far north!! WHAT!! My major cross street is happy valley and 74th and they acted like I was asking them to go to Jomax or Carefree Hwy. Your food is good, but your customer service sucks!!! Don't put delivery on your menu if you won't even go across the street from CCV... If you don't really offer it unless the customer is across the street from you, then save yourself a bad review by removing the transparent option from your offerings!"
test_2149,"Best artisan pizza in existence! The dough is delicious, the ingredients are premium quality, and they bake it in an actual wood burning oven in minutes, right in front of you.

People who said the crust wasn't soft or the cheese didn't melt (LOL) would be better off with Pizzahut, seriously.

I love 800 and I only go to other pizza places when it's late at night and the 800 is already closed. And I must add I'm never completely satisfied with other pizzas, nothing stands close to 800 for me."
test_2150,"Amazing facilities!
Train ride is cute and realistic.
My son loves to go to school and take a ride on the train when he gets good grades."
test_2151,"fun restaurant, EXTREMELY rude people working there.

I would suggest confirming your reservation multiple times, at least 3.  

---BEGIN RANT---

I went here with a group of 10 people, we made the reservation a week in advance, and when we showed up on a Saturday night the place was PACKED, the wait for a table would be 2 hours, and our reservation was nowhere to be found.

Lost reservation was bad, but to top it off the hosts and hostess had MAJOR attitude insisting that we were lying about making a reservation, arguing with us for no reason, and generally making us feel very unwelcome.

Personally I don't enjoy being treated like crap when all I want to do is bring your restaurant lots of business. 

Just because your restaraunt is decorated in a trendy way and serves sushi doesn't mean you aren't in Pittsburgh, so lose the NYC attitude Nakama!

---END RANT---"
test_2152,"My wife and I went to the buffet right when its open, so the line was pretty short. The workers are night and friendly. 

The food section was alright. From Asian food to Mexican food, Italian food and even American food. They even have a variety of delicious dessert to choose from.

Wine and beer is even included with the buffet."
test_2153,"I came here around a month ago for a balayage caramel highlight. I ended up with an ombre ash blonde highlights. 

The service was excellent and the salon was clean. 

However, the most important part to a hair service for me is the end result of my hair.

It doesn't look bad. It's just not what I wanted. 

I mentioned I was going on a one month vacation after and couldn't get it fixed the following days thinking they'd be more careful with the colour. 

I will most likely not return."
test_2154,I think this place is great.  Bao and her mom always do a great job and I am never disappointed.  The prices are good and Bao is hilarious.  I referred all my friends and they love it as well.  I get a great pedicure and I am entertained the whole time by Bao's stories.  I highly recommend this place!
test_2155,"First visit was yesterday. Easiest process ever! Sign your papers for your chart, watch a short introductory (and very informative!) video of what exactly to expect by being adjusted. Given your little key card/bar code scanner and the receptionist says that its your virtual chart (pretty nifty if you need to visit another location!)

I was a little nervous, as this was my first adjustment. Joe was kind and he talked me through what he was doing at all times. Ahh, the relief! Just hearing that POP (by the way, isn't your bones popping!) and feeling more flexibility and range of motion is a relief! 

The receptionist explained pricing, and all of their packages are totally worth it. Can't wait to go back!

Edited to add: I received in the email, a handwritten thank you letter from them! In a day and age of less than average customer service, this was a nice little touch!"
test_2156,"They did not,open on time. Employees just standing around at 6:10 goofing off. They saw me and another person standing outside.  One employee was prepping food without gloves.  I have Called Las Vegas health department."
test_2157,"Took my best friend here for Tonsillitis, Absolutely horrible service!!! Waited over 3 hours and still never got put in a room! The two nurses Lindsey and Amy were very rude!!!! They need to learn to have compassion for patients that are in pain!!! Kendal was very sweet, they need to learn from her how to treat patients!!!!!"
test_2158,"So frustrated with AT&T's horrible service! AT&T was so bad, they credited my account (which sounded good, but due to horrible communication, they shut off my services and issued collection calls over the service amounts THEY offered to credit!) and convinced me to switch to uverse which is just as bad! Internet service is non reliable and there seem to be no competent customer service staff to help sort thru the issues. I feel AT&T has gotten so big that they no longer know how to service people.  GO ANYWHERE BUT AT&T!!"
test_2159,"I went on a Saturday!!! BUSY af our food took forever !! I saw everything that was going on cause I was sitting on the bar. When the food was ready, it was just sitting there for 20mins & the hosts didn't know what they were doing they ALL seem SO distracted, they couldn't carry the food right, it seem like they need MORE training. I feel like they should All sit down talk with the mananger & get training again. I NEVER write any bad comment but damn ya need HELP !!"
test_2160,"Awesome food and the best service anywhere! 
Will definitely be on my regular place to return to."
test_2161,"I had the pleasure to watch my best friend get ready for her military ball, so I got to see first hand, the mastery that is @GlammedUpVegas!

These ladies are not only super skillful, but also down to earth and easy to talk to! Definitely will recommend to all my friends!"
test_2162,"Nancy and her staff have been wonderful to the ""rich white trash mother"" spank your naughty ass son and tell him to grow up be a man and work some steps, your ass is grass if you don't want to follow the rules but if you're ready to change your life this is the place"
test_2163,"Today we my first time to order from here. And i got to say i was impressed. Have to start with the call i made and Eddie answered very professionallly. He answered my questions and told me prices. He was very nice. After i ordered and paid by credit card, Eddie told me it would take 25 mins. Wow. That is fast. Eddie personally delivered the pizzas and he was very nice and smiling. He gave me my pizzas and cheese bread and told me to enjoy. I had a fist bite and i was happy. I had been craving pizza for so long that se√±or pizza satisfied my craving. I recomend this pizza joint. My pizza was ight on the sauce and thin crust the way i like it. And my cheese bread was garlicy. The way i like it too. My family loved the pizza amd cheese bread. They have a faithful customer here with me! Thank you Eddie and se√±or pizza."
test_2164,"A decent sushi all-you-can-eat place. Lunch is about $21 including tax and tips.

The ingredients - rice, seaweed, raw fish - taste fresh to me (which is not true at every restaurant I've been to). The wait service is decent speed, and the restaurant is small and cozy. The menu has a comfortable selection of sushi, hand rolls, teriyaki, other things I forgot, and a small handful of dessert items.

Owners and employees appear to be Cantonese-speaking."
test_2165,"I've never had a bad experience here.   Food, especially their soups, are very good.  I recently planned to meet some friends here but misjudged their lack of parking.  I don't mind walking in the summer, but in the winter you can freeze your butt off..but once inside, it's well worth it!"
test_2166,"Back in May 2015 , we were pre approved for a home loan. Before any pre approval, we disclaimed that we had a tax lien to the lender. The lenders response was that as long as we showed proof of payment history, that there shouldn't be a problem. We then went ahead and put money down to get the lot we wanted. Once sufficient funds were given, ground was broken. Everything was going as planned till about a week before our walk through. The lender started asking for more IRS documents. We spent all day at the IRS office to fulfill their request. A couple of days later, we received a message to see if we could get a co signer. We then begun the process of getting our daughter and son in law to co sign. By this time it was days before our walk through, and the lender called us and said that it was better for us to just get the the loan under the original buyers, but that we had to give three additional monthly payments to the IRS in order to get the loan. By this time, our move in date had past. Now the builder starts asking for us to sign an extension fee letter. We advised with the lender and he said we couldn't afford extension fees,  yet they wanted us to sign a $150 a day fee extension. He stated that he was going to try and get the fees waived but no guarantees. If the extension paper wasn't signed he also stated that the builder would can us. We finally came to realize that the lender was never on our side, they were there just to make money. Buyers be aware of this lender as they have no sense of urgency or communication. It is never their priority.  The main builder is American West Homes."
test_2167,Very disappointed! Overpriced on Char Siew and Roast pork if you get them together on a small plate. What's even worse is the taste gone downhill!
test_2168,"I've been going here the past few days to write. I enjoy the environment, drinks, and snacks. They also have great customer service. I used to go to another cafe shop that's open late; however this place is much quieter and the staff is much nicer. Today I decided to move tables when a more comfortable seat opened up. While moving, one of the employees helped me move my snacks and drinks without hesitation. It's the thought that counts and this gesture will keep me coming back and recommend other people to come here too!"
test_2169,"One of the worst burgers I ever had. Had to spit it out.  The fries were very gross too- near tasteless, what taste there was, was awful."
test_2170,"Great cut, friendly service, and for a walk in at $30 with a juice box upon arrival - yes, this must be as good as it gets :-)

Better than many $70 cuts I've had. Great job Maya Hair Salon. Don't be afraid to try it"
test_2171,"Dr Rock is great. Good listener and seems to care. 
There is no direct line to the office so if you need something(Dr Rock said he was ordering a MRI with contrast but the radiologist had a no contrast order) so I needed the order to be changed. Forever trying to get thru to his office staff. Once I did, they were great."
test_2172,"Happy hour is the only way to really enjoy all the many choices ... We overindulged for the happy hour price you cannot go wrong. A

Bathrooms were disgusting and it was a very slow Sunday when we went. Afraid to see what the kitchen looks like.

All the food was good, nothing spectacular but the price was right for it."
test_2173,"Got a dealfind voucher and am trying to make an appointment here, but: 

1) Called the number NINETEEN TIMES (yes, you read that right) and no-one answers, even though according to their hours they should be open now

2) No way to leave a voicemail message

3) Their website is either a fake address or not working.

Will update if things change, but for now it looks like this is another Dealfind scam (they sell vouchers for businesses that don't exist or cannot be contacted, or never deliver the promised service). AVOID DEALFIND LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!"
test_2174,"I go for breakfast on the weekends and it's always great, good service and big portions , also perfect after a long night on the strip try the Biscuits and gravy then home for
 some shut eye."
test_2175,"Virgin America is my favorite airline. I don't know how it is going to be after the merger with Alaska Airlines is completed. I love how you can order what ever you want from your seat and that there is wifi and plugs for your devices. 

Just stepping into the plane makes you feel like this is going to be a special time. The mood lighting makes you feel calm and serene. There is always room for your bags in the overhead cabin and so much more leg room than a lot of other airlines. I have never had a bad experience on Virgin America. They have the best in-flight movies, (which were complimentary). I watched The House, it was so funny, I literally had to cover my mouth. I have not flown internationally with them, but I can only imagine that it is an even better experience. 

I like that the in-flight exit instruction is on video and it is entertaining to watch. There were very few interruptions and smooth sailing to Las Vegas and back. Now, I know that is a short trip, but they still provided complimentary beer, wine, and water. Unlike some of the ""no frills"" airlines that basically charge you for toilet paper! Now, because it is a short trip, I remembered my place in the movie, and because of their technology, I was able to fast forward to that spot and watched the other half on the way home! 

The flight attendants were on it and the pilots were awesome! My kind of airline."
test_2176,"Met up with friends here on Saturday for an early dinner. Getting a reservation was a bit difficult, but it was definitely worth it.

Started off with Beef Carpaccio (good, but not outstanding), Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti (spectacular; crispy and pillowy at the same time, sauce was a fantastic match), Buttermilk Fried Calamari (incredibly crispy, and not all batter, and the accompanying red pepper almond sauce was quite nice), and Libretto Meatballs (can't speak to as I didn't try them, but the plate was clean when we were done)

For pizzas, ordered two of the Cremini Mushroom and a House-Made Sausage. Crust was thin, crispy, and flavourful. Pizza toppings were fresh & tasty.

Absolutely enjoyed everything, and wouldn't think twice about coming back the next time we make it into town!"
test_2177,"This location is always quick, friendly, and the food is amazing. I absolutely LOVE their little egg flag that you put up when you need something and they always react SO quickly. It's awesome!"
test_2178,"We bring the littles here -- they do a solid job, they're patient with all the anxieties kids have (or at least mine do), the online check-in is terrific (especially on mobile devices) and it's not too hard to find a sale or promotion. 

Doesn't cost a lot. Doesn't stress me out and more importantly -- doesn't stress them out.

Tip of the cap to the management."
test_2179,"I was really excited to visit scapegoat considering all of the 5 star reviews but I just can't give 5 stars. My friend and I came in for happy hour on Friday at 5:30 and had extremely slow service. The one bartender was the only bartender and sever in the entire place and we had to go to the bar 3 times to get him to come over to our table to take our order. Food and wine was delicious, but customer service needs improvement (maybe having more than 1 employee working)."
test_2180,"I know it's hard to believe, but I'm not a natural blond. I come here for my hair colouring needs! 
I've been coming here for over a year and a half with Olivia as my stylist but my last two appointments have been with Aaron and Sam. This is because I procrastinate booking an appointment until I feel like it's time for another bleaching session and by then, Olivia is fully booked up. Normally I would wait until Olivia has a cancellation but for my last two appointments, I was going on vacation and needed my hair done asap.  

Having my hair done by multiple stylists, I can say that everyone is talented, very knowledgeable, and friendly. They also work together as a team, are always quick to help each other out, and everyone (stylists and customers alike) seems to genuinely enjoy being in the salon; I know I do. 

The only negative thing I have to say is the wait times. Everyone is booking 3+ months in advance and Aaron is still training and only books a limited number of appointments each month. But there are ways to expedite a booking such as contacting the Admin Assistant Chau to be put on a wait list for cancellation. 

One last thing, please request for Aaron to wash and tone your hair. He's very gentle and gives an amazing head and neck massage!"
test_2181,"I got a gift card for this place as a Christmas present so decided to watch ""The Interview"" here. If you're going to watch a movie, see if it's playing here as ticket prices are so much cheaper than Cineplex. The items sold at the concession stand are a lot cheaper as well. Staff here seem to be people who are interested in movies and not high schoolers in need of a part-time job. The place is clean with comfortable seats and small theatres (you can sit anywhere and watch movies comfortably). I like the location as well as it's literally ten steps from College Station.

Good for: movies"
test_2182,"I've been collecting old Kodak cameras since I was a kid.  I ran across one of the old Bantam cameras at this pawn shop, and I feel like I stole it for the price I paid for it.

I regularly visit when I'm driving by now, just to see what kind of gems they might have."
test_2183,My favourite nail place by far. Everyone that works there is sweet and friendly and my shellac manicures or polish change always lash 3 weeks without chipping
test_2184,Brought a friend here when she was visiting from the East Coast--seemed appropriate. ;) Food was great and the service was even better. The french fries are oh so good.
test_2185,This place has delicious breakfast! We have tried several menu breakfast platters and they have all been really good. Exceptional chicken friend steak with country gravy and the sausage seemed homemade! Grandson and hubby are constantly after me to order
test_2186,Good food but not amazing. Good for a quick affordable meal if you want to avoid fast food.
test_2187,I've visited this location twice and have been very pleased both times. The donuts at Daylight Donuts are fresh and light without being overly sweet or greasy. Their selection is fairly large and straightforward--nothing crazy or overly complicated with wild sauces or cereal. The employees are very friendly and helpful and the store is very clean. I'm glad they have moved to my neighborhood!
test_2188,"I went here with some of the guys last year and we were looking for some 'serious' toned and slender meat.  I encouraged the guys to try this place in the Palms Hotel after hearing about it from some other friends.

The decor is modern as the restaurant is cast in a slighter darker environment with blue hues coming from the ceiling to give it a nice effect.

Our main dish between five guys was 2 Ribeyes that were 40 oz each.....  OMG.... the meat was prepared 'perfectly' in my opinion and each bite was so tender and flavorful with its' pepper-seared taste.

I had a lobster bisque before dinner that was perfect in its own manner, but, thinking back, I probably didn't need to order it as I was severely stuffed from eating all that steak.

Nice time I'm in Vegas, I'm coming back for another visit and bringing a nice bottle of Red to enjoy with dinner.... 

I recommend fully... and then some."
test_2189,Met up with some pals and tried out this lovely tavern for the first time. We order a bunch of apples and beers and it was really tasty and the staff was super friendly. Will definitely go back! :)
test_2190,"Had my doubts trying this place since there seems to be mixed reviews. I would rate this place 5 stars in both the service and quality of food. Definitely delicious fresh tasting seafood I've had in the valley. The baked lobster and Shrimp San Remo is a must get! I'm giving it 4 stars because it was a bit pricey.  I understand if this was at a high end fine dining restaurant maybe they can get away with the prices, but it isn't. Knock off $5-10 on the entrees then it will definitely deserve the 5 star review."
test_2191,"It's a tradition to sit out on the out door patio of Fatburger located right on the Las Vegas strip, dead center of all the craziness. At night they have bartenders who flare and  play good music like Kaskade (and similar artist) that makes you want to get your food and fuel for the next party. During the day it's just a nice shaded spot  which I can personally hang out at for hours until the sun goes down. The food is excellent but do not expect any healthy alternatives if you are watching your weight but who can stay on a diet while on vacation in Vegas, what is the point? The inside of Fatburger is for the families with childern to help shield them from the drunks and exposed bodies that walk the strip. I have only walked through to use the restroom :)...which is a disaster but you win some you lose some."
test_2192,Love going here! Great customer service and i love the beds. This is my favorite place to go
test_2193,"By far the best Chinese I've had in the Pittsburgh area. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. And everything was great value, will definitely be coming back."
test_2194,"This used to be my ""go to"" Chinese take out place.  No more since I saw their Dirty Dining violations.  This review will probably be removed just like my last one."
test_2195,"Fried Rice - Tasteless, Tasteless
Chicken Wings - Dry, Dry
Pot Stickers - Doughy, Doughy

test_2196,"I've only been to this location once to drop off some donation items.  Although I have never been inside, this review is purely based on the customer service.

It's not really clear what they can't and can do, in terms of customer assistance.  However, it would seem that if a customer is showing up at their drop-off location to donate goods which assist in revenue, then the employees should be very willing to show some enthusiasm and positiveness to assist.  There were two cars at the drop off, and the employee just seemed very not in a hurry to do anything.  It was the appearance and attitude almost, that if the customer could do most of the work it would have been better.

Again, this review is just on the customer service."
test_2197,"I've worked in customer service before and I know the customer isn't always right. But don't let your customer who just spent hundreds of dollar with you leave unhappy...

The room was pretty nice and the experience staying at the hotel was great. Unfortunately, although I booked a non-refundable, prepaid room, I was never billed until I checked out. Additionally, when the front desk asked me at check-in if I wanted to keep the same card on file for damages, etc., they neglected to mention that a large hold would be placed on the card for five days after check out. 

I acknowledge that I missed that they didn't charge me when I booked but they definitely indicated that I'd be charged the deposit and I even received an email detailing the charges right after I booked (I happened to have a little more money in my account than usual at that time so I wasn't monitoring as closely as usual). When I checked in they told me it had already been paid yet I checked my bank account multiple times throughout the weekend and no charge, other than the hold for damages, was added until immediately after checking out. 

I contacted the hotel immediately. Since it was a holiday I got the accounting dept voicemail and customer service wasn't available. I was finally contacted two days later with little result. By that time I had contacted the corporate customer service and now, almost two weeks later, I've finally received a response with nothing more than an apology. Poor customer service and follow up, as well as confusing and potentially deceptive billing. Not cool."
test_2198,"Can't give no stars or I would.  Hadn't been for quite awhile.  Went 3 weeks ago when advertised special for steak & lobster.  It was sooooo cold in there and I mentioned several times and waitress said nothing could be done.  Told her to the box food and I left.  Called manager who said to come back and  give another try -- they would comp.  Went tonight with my son -- we waited forever for the manager to come out.  He NEVER came but told waitress to comp my dinner.  I was paying for son's dinner.  BOTH our steaks were coated in red Fajita seasoning and spicy.  We never asked for spicy Fajita seasoning.  Asked for manager to come out and he said they ALWAYS put that on.   WTF?   Who automatically ruins a good steak with Fajita?  I'm at a steak house, not Mexican restaurant.  I couldn't eat it and will NOT EVER return if they truthfully ruin steaks with Fajita automatically.  What are they trying to cover up?????????"
test_2199,"What a great ""girls night"" or ""date night"" idea. Each class is centered around a topic such as grilling or seafood or vegetarian or desserts etc. Each class has room for 15 to 20 students. You can go by yourself or you can bring a friend or a group. At the beginning of each class you get a recipe booklet that you can take home with you and then the instructor goes through how to make each dish. Then you split up and make the dishes. Once everything is cooked,  you sit down and eat and have wine or iced tea.  It's really fun, and since the teacher shows you how to make everything, even if you don't make a given dish you still know the secrets to making it. I really enjoyed every class that I've gone to over the years and many of the recipes have become some of my go-to standard recipes. There's also a cooking store attached to the cooking area, and you can find some really neat things there.  Highly recommend!"
test_2200,"I've heard great things about this place for awhile so we finally made time to check it out. We came in around 5ish on a Wednesday. Since it's summer we definitely didn't want to brave sitting outside so we snagged a table inside. Inside is cute but it is a little cramped since it's a small space. I'm excited to return when the weather is cooler to check out the amazing looking patio. 

Everyone working was sooo friendly, nice and helpful. Great service and really makes you feel welcome. Wednesday's are burger and shake night, so if you are in on a Wednesday be sure to ask them what the special is!

Happy hour is from 4-6pm so we actually ended up ordering off the HH menu. I got the turkey burger sliders and my girlfriend got the roast beef sliders. The HH version comes with 2 sliders each. The turkey burgers come with a side of chips and the roast beef comes with au jus. They were each around 5 dollars. The dinner versions come with 4 sliders each and chips and are about double the price. What a deal!

The turkey sliders were topped with mayo, Brie, bacon and apple. The flavor was awesome.. I was quite surprised by how much I loved them! The portion size was great too and I can eat a lot. 

The roast beef sliders come topped with horseradish and cheese. They were also tasty and a good size. 

Overall this is a cute spot to grab a drink, stop for happy hour or come in for a meal. I definitely want to be back to try their breakfast (looks like they have a good coffee operation too- they even have a drive thru in the morning!) and check out the patio on a cooler day."
test_2201,i was not expecting much from this restaurant but i was wrong. it was a cold day in vegas and we visited the restaurant which was packed. so i figured it must be good. got on the waiting list and took a seat in the lounge. w o w. beautiful space. there is a firepit in there that warms you right up. dark atmosphere which i like. we waited about 20 mins. was greeted by a server in the lounge almost immediately. ordered a drink while we waited. they have damn good strawberry daquiris!! me and the boyfriend shares an entree and it was great. an employee? came by and asked if we wanted a complimentary picture taken and printed for us and i thought it was a joke because she looked like a zombie and had no markings to show she was an employee. strange theyd have her representing their business weirding customers out
test_2202,I worked here as a teenager and now thirty years later went to have dinner at the tropicana blvd and the worst dinner.  Cold fries and the order wasn't even correct...a cheeseburger with no cheese and cold
test_2203,"Extremely mediocre food and poor customer service. Would rather go to a fast food joint, would not return again."
test_2204,"I am an Adams customer due to a friend who'd been using them for years.  My service with  them started in 2002 and I have been nothing but satisfied with not only the skill and ""manners"" of the team, but also their willingness to ""get me in the schedule"" when there is an emergency. I have recommended the company to most of my friends and all of my family, we are all very pleased with the service and knowledge of each and every crew member we've been sent. We have air conditioning, heater and evaporative cooler all purchased from and cared for by Adams.  The few times I've asked them to go above and beyond, they've been right there for me.  Thanks !"
test_2205,Great attention to detail.  Friendly personality and makes you feel very comfortable right away. Cute studio too!
test_2206,"This place is SUITE!!! All they have is suites! Very spacious. Second time staying here and it's still my all time favorite Vegas hotel. The last time I stayed here I found out the sofa turns into a bed...! Just a hint for those of you looking to save some cash and still have all the frills.

The casino is great and I especially liked their video roulette with live wheel. $5 minimum w/o having to share a table with everyone else. I was constantly asked for my ID and I didn't have not one cocktail waitress ask me if I wanted anything though...the hell

Grand Lux Cafe (upscale Cheesecake Factory) is open 24hrs and has a large menu. No buffets here but Thomas Keller's Bouchon IS here.

The pool was pretty cool and hosts Tao Beach - a beach club. There's also Tao Asian Bistro and Tao Nightclub. The bistro turns into the nightclub. Didn't go but it looked nice. 

They strictly enforce the display of a room key for entry into the suites

I definitely recommend staying here"
test_2207,"I'm taking a ceramics class in college and I know NOTHING about clay or any necessary supplies. My professor gave out a very basic list of items needed for the class with no descriptions. I went in and let the girls behind the counter know that I knew nothing and needed clay. They were so helpful and gave me some descriptions of what to expect with a few different types of clay. This was so awesome that they cater to seasoned, talented artists and brand new confused people! I feel so much more confident for my class now that I've had some help."
test_2208,"Had reservation for small SUV. Told it would be 20mins, it was in the car wash. After 40 mins, they tell me there are no SUV's (wasnt it just in the car wash??) so I could get a mini-van or a sedan.  Ok, mini-van if I must.  Wait 20 mins please. Another 40 mins, I inquire. Manager goes to check on it. Nice man working offers me a free 2nd day but I only need the car for about 4 hours, so I ask for comp on gas, Ok he says.  25 mins later, I'm mad, go next door to Enterprise, they have SUV's.  Go see if I can cancel and get refund...now the mini-vans ready. Nice man is now off shift. I mention his gas offer to the manager, she looks at me like I'm outta my mind, tells me I already was given an ""upgrade"" to the mini-van, I about lost it! I DONT WANT the mini-van, I WANT my reserved SUV, keep your ""upgrade""!! She says she will contact the man to see what we agreed on. I go to get the car, I see TWO Suv's there.  I ask the lovely lady at the key kiosk about them, she hooks me up into one of the SUV's quickly.  As I'm going to SUV the manager walks by, tells me she added the note about the free gas to my account and was nice.  I'm sure they all have heard alot of angry words, esp if this is the norm for them.  I feel bad for the employees here.
So, even though I received the SUV I had reserved, and got approval for free gas (we used so little the register barely moved) the waste of my time and the frustration of the event has me saying I would never use Advantage again.  Not to mention I was not the only one waiting or frustrated.  This was a Tuesday afternoon.  The rate was awesome, but I would have easily paid double next door at Enterprise (or any other) to not waste 2 hours of my precious Vegas time, especially since we rented the car specifically to drive to Red Rock Canyon to drive and walk a bit through that park."
test_2209,"Took my car here yesterday to get some repairs done. They were much cheaper than the dealer and had great customer service. they asked several times if I needed a ride to work after I dropped my car off and then again to pick it up. They have a very friendly staff! 

Side note, don't avoid this place because it looks fancy and expensive, building and signage look great and the prices are very fair. I won't take my car anywhere else."
test_2210,"This place is walking distance to my office so if you are driving it may be difficult to find parking.  I had the H3 sushi, edamame, and miso soup.  Total came out to $18.  The sushi was good and fresh.  It took a while to get the soup and edamame but overall it was a pleasant trip.  Wish they had better lunch sushi deals but the price is expected for quality sushi downtown."
test_2211,"Long time customers so we ordered breakfast last Sunday morning: rancid coffee, uht half and half curdled, eggs and bacon incorrectly prepared despite instructions, cold food, english muffin sliced awkwardly and untoasted.  

Will not be returning."
test_2212,Every time I am in Vegas I go to the Border Grill for a drink and appetizers.  They have the very best margaritas I have ever had.  They are a little pricey but in this case you get what you pay for.
test_2213,This place has definitely improved since we were here last year. Really enjoyed ourselves. It's smaller and less of a hassle than the bigger casino bowling alleys. Good mix up of music. Mostly families playing which is a nice change from the young and obnoxious crowds that usually frequent a bowling alley on a Saturday night. Looking forward to planning my son's 6th bday party here at the end of this year. Hope this place keeps up the good work.
test_2214,"Found this place on the Food Network's DDD list for great taco places and it didn't disappoint! I had one each of chicken, beef and shrimp tacos and my husband had the beef tongue. They were all great! The house made corn tortilla was fresh and soft and the meat was flavorful, even the tongue! Wish they would put more cilantro and onion but otherwise awesome. The cashier was friendly and patient as we tried to decide what to order. Happy we made a stop at a local place on the way to the airport!"
test_2215,"Google maps says that the restaurant closes at 10:00 pm and their restaurant time board says 9:30 pm. Travelled 7 miles and reached by 9:00 pm they said only 3 kinds of biryani are available. Since I am a vegetarian I was not left with much options but I was seeing food coming out and person in front of have also ordered all different kind of food. Very disappointed with the kitchen staff. I really appreciate the lady at the front who was taking the order she has requested the chef but looks like he was tired and not in a mood to make any food, Highly disappointed."
test_2216,"Great service,  reliable, friendly and dependable. My choice for nearly 4 years!! I've used many different shops over the years and all have been ok. I like the fact that my clothing is always ready as promised!!"
test_2217,"If you are coming to Vegas, fine dine yourself at SUSHISAMBA. It's an absolute must as there was definitely a samba, fiesta, and crazy epic party in my mouth happening. 

I came here for weekday lunch with two friends and it's quite empty BUT DON'T LET THAT DETER YOU FROM EATING HERE AT ALL! Do make a reservation just in case! 

The unique ambiance that makes the restaurant look deceptively larger than it is has cozy booths to sit in as we deciphered which choices on the menu to select (because unfortunately we couldn't have everything... even though we literally wanted EVERYTHING).

Order everything I state here. For real. 
JAPANESE A5 WAGYU BEEF GYOZA (ALL GYOZA SHOULD BE THIS INTERESTINGLY GYOZAWESOME)
TUNA TATAKI (BEST BITES OF TUNA I'VE EVER HAD)
BLUE POINT OYSTERS (MAXIMIZE THE APHRODISIACS WHILE YOU ARE IN VEGAS)
DUCK BREAST (CAN I GET A QUACK QUACK?!)
DESSERT... GET THE BANANA SPLIT (THEIR DECONSTRUCTED VERSION IS EXTREMELY WELL CONSTRUCTED). 

I can't wait to try their location in NYC, but for now I'll reminisce the Peruvian-Brazilian-Japanese Vegas food day club party version of Wet Republic and Encore combined!"
test_2218,"What a great spot for a delicious, healthy lunch and/or smoothie. Unique combinations that don't taste like every other ""healthy"" spot out there. The staff are kind and friendly. Love this joint. More of a takeout place as there's no seating (only a stand-up area where you can eat if you'd like)."
test_2219,"Great truck accessory shop. I dealt with Matt there after I was referred by two friends to the shop. I needed s hitch for my truck. They were excellent on customer service , well stocked showroom and good prices. Next will be wheels, tires and lift."
test_2220,"Nancy and her staff have been wonderful to the ""rich white trash mother"" spank your naughty ass son and tell him to grow up be a man and work some steps, your ass is grass if you don't want to follow the rules but if you're ready to change your life this is the place"
test_2221,"Been there countless times for their pan-fried dumplings and eggplant hotpot.  Otherwise, a perfectly fine cheap-Chinese restaurant."
test_2222,"This place is one of the only authentic Japanese restaurants in Arizona! A mom n pop type restaraunt, it is very affordable! I ordered tenzaru soba and they gave a HUGE portion of tempura! I ordered a katsu don to go and was pretty disappointed with the portion size though. However, for the price, this place is great if you're looking for Japanese!"
test_2223,I just hade a wonderful experience here at the peppermill....it started with the great hostess & our waiter jorge he displayed a professional & great attitude to me and my guest! I will recommend all of my friends and others to come here great job to all staff members here!
test_2224,I absolutely love this kim-chi... just $9.99 for  almost 8 lb!!  A few ounces at the health food store is over $10!
test_2225,"Have you ever told a doctor, ""My legs hurt where they attach?"" How about, ""Hey doctor, my feet sort of feel weird, they feel numb at times."" Then they shrug their shoulders. Don't wait for your primary care doctor to help you. Go into Foothills Sports Medicine and get evaluated by Matt Hubble. Sciatica problems can show up as bothersome symptoms way down in your feet and toes, so don't spend time at a foot doctor. And hip flexor problems can cause all sorts of problems that you would never associate with this huge muscle group. Matt and the team at Foothills can evaluate you and get to the real cause of your pain and problems."
test_2226,Very professional work. Took the time to explain each detail of the report and answered any questions I had on the spot. Would recommend.
test_2227,"I really don't know why i am giving  his place a 4 out of 5 besides my somewhat new practice of only giving 4's to redeem my early over rating of so many places with 5's. In Vegas for work. First night ate in our hotel at the Border Cantina. Rates high on yelp and was close. Tonight we taxi'd to the Venitian to try Yardbird. Chef listed as a great place. Coworker made a suggestion that turned out to be spectacular. Lewellen's Southern fried chicken, Collard greens and fried okra. I started with an Atomic Duck IPA and once I bit into the chicken I knew we made the right choice. Holy Hit'she if you like southern cuisine this is a must. I chicken'd out from ordering the $36 Chicken-n-Watermelon-n-Waffles. What I had to eat was truly amazingly well prepared. We sat at the bar because the wait was thirty minutes. My I watch warned me that I hit 100 bpm while eating.  we were watching a soccer match but still. Wow."
test_2228,great service. spent a lot of time finding the right shoe
test_2229,"I'm originally from California where we've had Trader Joe's for a long time, and so I was very happy when this Trader Joe's came to town! I still have to drive about 45 minutes to get here, but it's worth it. I love Trader Joe's. They have a large, friendly and very helpful staff, and a nice variety of good healthy foods, produce, dairy, meats, frozen items, including many organics and the cost is very reasonable. I don't drink wine but cook with it occasionally, and they also have a big wine selection. I do a good part of my grocery shopping here every week! If you've never been to a Trader Joe's you really should check them out. 

Hint: go as early in the morning as possible because they do get very busy as the day goes on, and the parking lot gets filled up too."
test_2230,"This is one of the best kept secrets in town! The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgable about all of their products. My fiance and I recently went in for a cheese plate, and the woman working there allowed us to try all three cheeses before making the tray for us. Delicious! They also offer sandwiches with very fresh meats, cheeses and veggies, and they always have samples out of their cheeses and meats. I have not tried their chocolates, but my parents said they were some of the best they'd ever had. I highly recommend this place!"
test_2231,"I love the room, but long walk from lobby to the room. Great breakfast!! Love the overall experience staying at the Venetian."
test_2232,"I love shaved ice! This little place is right across from UNLV and is one of my new favorite places for refreshing treat. I went in for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I fell in love. I got a small shaved ice with a side of condensed milk. You have so many flavors to choose from and you just add your own syrup. The area is kind of sketchy, but don't let that discourage you. It's worth it!"
test_2233,"Food: Of all the restaurants I have gone to that served bread while we waited for our entrees, Outback's bread is the best (slightly above Cheesecake Factory)! For my entree, I had the grilled shrimp Caesar salad. The dressing was lightly tossed into the salad, which made me happy because a lot of restaurants douse their salad with dressing. The salad was enjoyable and was the right portion, but not something I'd return to order again. I loved the croutons in it though. My husband had the Porterhouse steak. I'm not a fan of steak, but this one was very nicely seasoned and prepared well. It even made me think perhaps I should have ordered a steak! We also had the blackberry sangria which was nicely sweetened and refreshing, but the husband thought it was too sweet.

Atmosphere: Same as all the other Outback Steakhouses. It is pretty popular. When we left at 9, I still saw people coming in.

Service: We ate here on a Monday night. We got there around 730 and were seated at 8. Our server at the bar was extremely helpful and attentive. Even though I was waiting for our table, she offered to get me a glass of water. Our table server was quick, and she also let me have more bread after I finished it. Two issues I had about the server though was: (1) I asked for my salad to have dressing on the side. It arrived already tossed into the salad. (2) We had dinner with a colleague and asked to split the check. She did, but she put the colleague's drink on my and my husband's check. (I thought it would be common sense to put the drink on there too and I won't have to specifically tell her what should be on each check.) Overall, I had a good dinner and she was helpful when I asked for a takeout bag, so I let it go, but I'm still a little annoyed about those two points. :) 

Other: My napkin smelled moldy. Thank goodness it was black. If it was white, I think it would have looked horrendous.

Bottom Line: The experience at this Las Vegas location is no different from eating at any other Outback Steakhouse. What stood out to me that evening were the double servings of bread, the sangria, the steak, and the croutons in my salad."
test_2234,"Reviewing Brett's Auto Service which is essentially Cary's just a different name, same shop. 

I went to Brett with a pretty good dent in my front right fender. He was very honest about what it would take to do the job and he seemed to know the difference between doing it right and over doing it. The results were great and the fender looks better than new. The price was fair and seemed rather standard for the area. 

The only reason for -1 star is being that this is an informal shop the whole process was very informal. Which in most cases is good however I would have liked to see a more formal quote of work and cost break down. I am sure he would have provided this however I didn't want to delay the repairs. 

Overall great shop with honest services."
test_2235,"NASTY. They are expensive, messed up our whole order and what we did get we didn't eat because it was so gross."
test_2236,"Extremely mediocre food and poor customer service. Would rather go to a fast food joint, would not return again."
test_2237,BBQ chicken wrap w a side of broccoli! Fresh food that tastes good aaaand is good for you. Love this place
test_2238,"Went at 6pm in a Friday, oddly empty inside. Wait staff was veeeeery slow to take drink orders, and then very slow to come take food orders. It seemed like there was only one waitress in and a new one in training. Food was good, can't deny that. Good beer list. Reasonable prices.  But the wait was ridiculous for how empty it was in there."
test_2239,"Brides, stop your wedding venue searching and go to Wedgewood Las Vegas at Stallion Mountain!!!! You will not regret it. They just won Best Wedding Spot of 2017 best of Nevada award, so awesome and well deserved. I got married on 9/9/2017. It was a beautiful day, the weather was perfect and more importantly the venue was perfect. I was not stressed at all, no bridezlla and I owe it all to the awesome staff at Wedgewood. 

Rewind to 2016, when I first started searching for my perfect venue. I researched venues online since it was a destination wedding. I couldn't stop looking at Wedgewood and the pictures and what they have to offer. My first venue appointment was at Wedgewood, I met with Jacquelyn. Jacquelyn is the sweetest person I have ever met, she told us everything we wanted to know and answered all of my questions and said we can do that, we can do anything you want. We did go to 2 other venues that day and I wanted to leave the other venues right away because I knew my answer was saying yes to Wedgewood as my perfect wedding venue. The pricing is very reasonable and you will not find a better price around. We did the Emerald package and it was so worth it. 50-100 people and we could have an open bar for the whole wedding 5 hours.   

Jacquelyn, the wedding coordinator, yes you have your own wedding coordinators the whole time planning and the day of the wedding. I give so much credit to Jacquelyn. She has been through it all with me and I can now say I have gained a new friend. She answered every email within the hour of sending. I never knew how easy it was to plan a wedding, Wedgewood gives you so many options and you just get to do the fun stuff and pick out colors, food and d√©cor. Jacquelyn was the coordinator the day of the wedding and I was so happy, because she knew everything we wanted and where we wanted it. I was so nervous the day of the wedding, so normal, Jacquelyn took me to show me the d√©cor in the reception area and my nerves calmed down and I had tears in my eyes because it was so beautiful and more than I dreamed. Jacquelyn is so professional and great at what she does, it takes a special person to talk to brides all day long.;) 

We chose Wedgewood's vendors and I loved them all. So happy they give you suggestions of vendors and they do chose the best in Vegas. Everyone is so nice and so accommodating. We went with Stephen Salazar photography and they were so awesome and so nice. I can't wait to see our pictures, since I can't stop looking at his work (other photos he has taken), so excited. We went with ACS Ann for the d√©cor and flowers, wow simply amazing. My flowers were so beautiful, I about cried when I saw them. The d√©cor was amazing, I had draping for the ceremony and for the reception. So beautiful. The pricing is very reasonable and you won't find a better price around. I chose Stevee Danielle for my updo. So professional and so nice. I had a trial and I loved it and I couldn't wait for the big day. Erica was my stylist and I had 3 bridesmaids get their hair done. Erica came to the hotel room the day of the wedding and she had all of us done within 1 hour and 30 mins. and our hair stayed in place all night long. Great pricing also. We also had the photo booth (Shutterbooth), which is a must, they make a book by the end of the night for you and your husband of all your guests that took pictures in the photo booth and your guests get to sign the pages. My guests had way too much fun in the photo booth, clearly from the pictures. What a great way to remember your night. We went with Freed's Bakery, the best cake I have ever had. We just finished our cake after 2 weeks and it was still so moist and delicious. We chose Pastor ED, that was unable to make it that day but we were blessed to have Pastor Don and he was great. DJ Tom, wow I give him so much credit. He did a fantastic job!!! He tried to please all my guests with all the song requests. He was very professional and very fun!!! I hope all listed all of the vendors. This is why I chose Wedgewood because there is so much to remember when planning a wedding and I didn't have to do the thinking Wedgewood did all of the hard work for me!!! 

I also want to mention the food, wow blew my shoes right off. So, so, so good!!! I had to try everything, which my plate was so full!!! Everything was so delicious. Evi, the head chef is awesome, so are all of his staff. My husband and I got to go through the buffet first (at Wedgewood, you can pick buffet or plated, we went buffet because of the cool buffet room) Evi and his staff helped us plate our food, they held our plate and got our food for us, we felt like royalty. Wedgewood has the best food ever, so much to chose from, 8 salads, yes 8, they were all so yummy. 
All of my guests can not stop talking about our wedding and how beautiful it was and how fun it was. All of my guests loved it all and want to go back. 
I want to thank everyone at Wedgewood and the vendors!! Best day ever"
test_2240,"It's oh so magical and oh so cold!

After eating at the buffet, we decided to walk around the Vegas strip to burn off those EXTRA EXTRA calories and made a stop at the front of the Bellagio fountains. It is really beautiful and amazing as people say it is. The songs and the water show really compliment the hotel and the area. It's like watching an upscale attraction minus the ticket prices. They play a show every 15 minutes and each show is a different song. The three shows we stayed for (yeah, we stayed there for 45 minutes!) were 1.) Lucy in the Sky by The Beatles (Loved it!) 2.) My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion (greatest sing-a-long ever!) 3.) some Italian song, which we did not know the words, but sang along with it...it was a fun night! It is a very romantic spot and a tourist attraction. We really wanted to hear the Carol of the Bells play because we heard the show is pretty amazing, but we got cold (yeah, the liquor wasn't doing it's job!). Make sure to remove the flash when taking pics of art show, it doesn't carry the same beautiful effect on your camera & phone."
test_2241,"Chou's kitchen is a nice little Chinese restaurant that specializes in food from the Dong bei or north eastern part of China. The foods are generally things like dumplings, the beef/pork pie, spicy lamb skewers, green onion pancakes, sour cabbage soup and many other foods that are similar to the items listed above. 

Must orders: lamb skewers and either the beef or pork pie
Highly recommended: green onion pancakes, pan fried chive dumpling, dumplings/pot stickers, Xiao long bao, sour cabbage soup

Most of my recommendations are appetizer sized so order one or order a few! The meat pies come in 3's"
test_2242,The girl at the front desk was rude and unprofessional! We walked out and didn't get a haircut for my daughter. She had an attitude right when we walked in. Will not be going back. First impression was terrible!
test_2243,"Came to this place for the first time because of the great reviews. Not sure if they were just having an off day or if this happens a lot, but we had a horrible experience here. We ordered our food at approx 11:20 and didn't get our food until 12.  I can understand that this place gets busy, but we saw people who walked in shortly after us with similar orders get there food at least 20 mins before us. After 30 mins of waiting, I went to ask if they had forgotten our food. They said it was about to come out, and we waited another 10 mins before the food came out. Eggs and crepe's were cold, burro was the only thing hot. Food overall was not as great as reviews that we had read, and the wait time just killed the experience completely. Will not be returning."
test_2244,"OMG:

It's the beginning of the end for us telling everyone about this place, but omg: It is hard to find, but sooo worth the drive. Family is awesome. Food is awesome. We may have to end up waiting in line soon, but this place is worth it. Fans of the old La Guadalupana on 16th St & Oak will swoon. 
Oh yeah:

TUESDAYS: Caldo!
WEEKENDS: Menudo!!"
test_2245,"Generally speaking, Montreal has a problem with pizza by the slice: it's heavy, it's bland and the crust tastes like cardboard. But then there's Adamo. 

With its thin crust, beautiful tomato sauce and fresh toppings, Adamo is the way pizza is meant to be eaten. Sure, if you're hammered after the bars, you can make a case for the other stuff, but if it's mid day and you want a satisfying slice, this is really your only option in town. 

I opted for Hawaiian (don't judge, it's delicious), but every option looked just as good. And did i mention that it's only $3.75 a slice? Standard, but given the quality, you're getting way more than you paid for. 

Don't waste time with a sloppy slice. Next time you're craving a quick pizza, you know where to go."
test_2246,"Came here for the first time as a senior, I'm now very sad that I didn't discover this place before now. I ordered a Jersey sandwich, except on sourdough and it was amazing. Very relaxed, laid back, clean place. They also have great workers, that will let you customize your order if you don't want certain aspects of one on the menus. Decently priced as well: I got chilli, a sandwich, and a drink for 12 bucks."
test_2247,"This pleace. Oh man, so good they use mesquite when cooking the steak. Cant be beaten. These are the best tacos this side of the border."
test_2248,"A 21.00 burger!  Was it worth it?  No way but I had time to kill and I was hungry.  The pizza place across from here wanted 16 bucks a slice so I went with the burger here instead.  

The burger was tasty and the small portion of fries were cold.  They really deserve less stars but the burger was tasty so I can't justify 2 stars.  

If you're thinking you'll have great food, don't bother.  The girl sitting next to me said the flatbread pizza wasn't good either.  She expected it to be flatter.  Hey, it is called flatbread for a reason!"
test_2249,"This place is amazing!  We had fried chicken, homemade biscuits, watermelon and delicious Brussel Sprouts.  Seriously don't miss this if you have the opportunity!  Yummy!!"
test_2250,"Pet Friendly Airports 

Many people consider their pets companions and the pets are part of the family, and my friends/ family  are no exception.  So,  I am  never surprised when my friends and family take their furry friends along with them on vacations. 

Lately, I have had friends/family visit with thier furry friends from California.  Thank goodness Sky Harbor offers three areas for their furry friends to stretch their legs, drink water and take potty breaks (there are even mitts for cleaning up after your pet). 

It's nice to see airports making it  easier to fly with pets."
test_2251,"I was in the Henderson area today to do some studying. My friend and I were craving anything with rice, did I mention the fact that we're asian? Anyway, Jun's Korean Restaurant came up and we were immediately on our way. This place has Meat Jun! (I don't know why, but they called it Meat Chun... In Hawaii we all say Meat Jun lol) 

They have their own private parking lot shared with the surrounding restaurants and shops. It is also located next to the Regal Cinemas. I came for the Meat Jun but ended up getting Bi Bim Bap (about $11 including tax), which was also very delicious! 

Bi Bim Bap is a signature Korean dish with veggies, eggs, sauce, and beef on top of rice. And you mix it all together. In this restaurant you could have it either on a plate or in the stone bowl. Of course I got it in the stone bowl because why not?! The taste was a 4/5, I've had better in Hawaii but it was still a successful lunch choice (Best Bi Bim Bap I've had in Vegas thus far)! The distance is quite far from where I live, so I would come here only if I was in the area craving Meat Jun or some good Bi Bim Bap. The proportions were good for it's price, my friend and I both couldn't finish our plates.

The customer service was okay, but not too much communication took place. However, may I say that the interior gives off a mellow/relaxed feeling. The pictures on the wall were big and pretty, just like their menu behind the front counter. It was easy to read. There were about 10 or more size-varying tables/chairs in the dining area and no outdoor seating. 

This is a good place to get some authentic Korean plates for lunch or dinner in Henderson. It's not too busy and the food quality was great!"
test_2252,"Visited the Peppermill for a late lunch around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Dining solo so I avoided the wait for a table and walked right up to counter seating. For some reason, even though I'm no one special, the shift supervisor waited on me personally and the service was excellent. 

I got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries, and it was both large and tasty. 

Love the ambiance and neon lighting. I'm Generation X-er, so anthing that reminds me of a Brat Pack movie is going to sit well with me. 

Don't forget to check out the Firepit Lounge, located just to your left as you walk in. Totally different atmosphere but just as positive. Perhaps a somewhat slower, more laid back pace. Enjoyed this place and will definitely be back."
test_2253,This is one place you must try one to visit Las Vegas.  I have a gluten allergy and I told them up front and they made my fried chicken fresh and with a gluten free flour.  They have authentic fresh brewed sweet tea from the south. Excellent service... I am glad there is one coming to Los Angeles....
test_2254,"Well, it looks like the reviews for this place are legit.

I went in initially to get an underarm wax, which is fast and easy and just about impossible to screw up, but after reading up on this place took the plunge and went for my first Brazilian. 

I'd had some really unpleasant waxing experiences a few years back and was kind of nervous, but Victoria really did an excellent job. Everything was very clean (no double dipping!), she was very fast and thorough and best of all it didn't hurt nearly as much as I thought it would. I won't lie, there were a couple of little sections that were a bit extra ouchy, but it was my first one and it still went by faster and was a lot more comfortable than I expected. 

Irritation was pretty minor overall and went away within 2 days. 

Victoria gave me some good aftercare instructions too so I could keep ingrowns at bay.

I was so happy with my first trip there that I went back a few days later and got a full leg wax. The hair on my legs was more sparse but again it was mostly quick and not painful and I don't have to worry about shaving my legs for 3-4 weeks wooooo!

The wax used on my legs was a harder pink wax from a warm roller, compared to the Italian cream wax they use for Brazilians. 

But yeah, if I lived in Vegas year-round this would be my go-to place. Avoid wax trauma and make it yours too!"
test_2255,"Dinner at Roy's was excellent! Our server Michelle was very attentive and helpful.

I started with a Jalape√±o Margarita and my husband had the Hawaiian Martini. 

We went with the Monday Prix Fixe menu which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. We asked Michelle about an old menu item they haven't carried in a while (braised pork roll topped with spicy tuna) and without hesitation she asked the chef and he made it for us. Way to go above and beyond!

I had the Misoyaki Butterfish which was cooked to perfection. I just can't explain how delicious it was. 

For dessert I had the chocolate souffl√© which was served with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. I was so full by the time I got dessert but who could turn down a hot right out of the oven souffl√©?"
test_2256,So good!  Tacos and guacamole were delicious.  Chili relleno was perfect.   Organic meats and fresh ingredients.
test_2257,"New spot in the Smiths plaza where tropical smoothie and Stephanos is at. Did a to-go order here, the place was nice and clean. The staff was nice and helpful.
I made my own poke bowl, did a large size which includes 3 proteins. I got shrimp tempura, ahi tuna and salmon. Loaded it with the toppings and the DIY sauce they have is good! 
The fish tasted fresh, although for a large I did wish they added more fish, felt like I was just eating the rice and proteins. And the shrimp tempura was either over cooked, or left out because it was not crunchy and did not have that fresh out the mini oven or dryer taste. 
Overall, a good place to try, will definitely come back to try their sushi burritos."
test_2258,They have very fresh sushi for a good price!  Very yummy ramen too!  My hubby and I went there for the second weekend now!  We like to sit at the bar and watch the sushi chef work.. and they are also quick with excellent service.
test_2259,"A quick lunch 
Noticed BBQ with good ratings nearby so felt the need...haven't had decent BBQ in awhile. 

Service was great 
Small dining area (or felt small during lunch lol)
Had the 2 meat meal. 
Brisket was delicious with good flavor
Turkey was moist with good flavor (seldom can I find decent smoked turkey, a real treat)
Mac n cheese was very good 
Beans were quite bland in my opinion. 
The little cornbread things (mini muffins) were dry but good flavor 

Nothing needed sauce.. to me that's a good sign. (Sauce is available )

Big disappointment was the side cups and soda cups..styrofoam! Better options out there."
test_2260,"This place is my favorite buffet. The ambiance is very very bland, but the food is really good and is one of the cheaper buffets- $34.99 per person. Their crab was so fresh.   I kept loading up on the crab, shrimp, tortellini Alfredo, and mini donuts. Those were all my favorites and I def ate like $75 worth of food for only $35. The other buffets have a lot of the same food but charge double just because the ambiance Is cool. Buffets to me are all about the food, might as well pay half when you aren't even looking around and are only focusing on the food"
test_2261,"My wife Heidi is writing the following review of Tanner at Wisemagic: 

""Tattoo parlors are not typically my bag; actually, this was my first tattoo and I was a bit nervous, but Tanner at Wisemagic was incredibly professional and made me feel comfortable from the start.  He carefully listened to exactly what I wanted for a tattoo. Because of his talent and artistic skill, my expectations were exceeded.
      The shop was clean and sanitary, the staff was welcoming and helpful, and if I ever want another tattoo, this will be my place. Thanks Tanner! """
test_2262,"This place has a really cute atmosphere and a great patio with a nice beer selection. (Yay white zombie!)   The service that I received here was very very slow.  It wasn't busy, yet it took us forever to get our beers and food, and to place our orders.  I got a hamburger with sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were good, but they had a little too much sugar on them for my liking.  It was more like a dessert.  The burger was good except it was really undercooked on one side. I was not asked how I would like it to be cooked so maybe that's why.  I'm not sure if I would return, if so it would be because of the atmosphere.  It would be a nice place to watch a football game though, they have a lot of televisions and I did really like the patio."
test_2263,"I took my granddaughter here for a pedicure for prom and she absolutely loved it. I bought her the deluxe pedicure and it didn't disappoint -- leg massage, hot stones, pumice rubs, and even a shoulder massage had her in seventh heaven. We will definitely be going here again."
test_2264,Just went here for the first time and OMG!!!! Pita kitchen is the bomb!!!! I had the chicken shawarma (without onions) and the chicken was so tender and so flavorful. My husband got the classic gyro pita with greek fries and he was in heaven!! The fries were so crispy and full of flavor! The Greek fries looked delicious with the feta cheese!!! We have found our pita/ Mediterranean place!!! We will be coming here again and again!!!!
test_2265,"I had the Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich, in which I don't recommend. The chicken itself along with the breading felt like it's the type that comes frozen and pre fried and all the restaurant does is kinda re fry it or just heat it up. When you take the breading away from the chicken it's mushy in between. Either not fried long enough or back to my original theory of frozen pre fried chicken. The slaw that comes with the sandwich is bland. No flavor whatsoever. The creamy sauce is more like colored mayonnaise. Overall the sandwich sucked. Good thing ketchup was invented! Fries sucked too! And it took like 15 minutes before I was acknowledged. I had to walk to the register to ask if that's is where I'm supposed to order. Thumbs down!"
test_2266,"The ambience of this place is great, however the service is terrible. We got a table for 4 and we're told they'd text us when it's ready, and we noticed multiple parties walk in and be seated before us (45 minutes later) . When we spoke up they immediately sat us.  We then sat there for over an hour as one drink took over 20 minutes to come out, and the appetizer of ""fondue dip"" aka- microwave pretzels came out cold. To make things worse the same bus boy walked by and asked 6 separate times if ""is this your food?"" Walking to the wrong table each time.  Left cash before even ordering dinner as we were all fed up with the service. The server apologized but that was honestly the worst service I've ever received eating out. This place has a lot of potential to be good, but currently is horrible. Do not go here."
test_2267,"What a great night at Piano Piano.  We went there following the glowing reviews from Toronto Life and were not disappointed.  The Ceasar salad is a dream - the charring of the lettuce adds a nice smoked flavour, the sauce is perfect....just loved it. The smoked burrata was good but a little bland for my taste - would have loved to feel the smokiness more.  For mains we had the ravioli bolognese and pizza ""The Fun Guy"". Both were delicious. I have to agree their pizza is absolutely amazing, and the ravioli were pretty good too - with a rich sauce with a bit of a kick that blended really well with the rich ricotta ravioli.  For desert we ended with the Tiramisu - unfortunately they were out of the Lemon Cake. The Tiramisu was fantastic...I was originally put of by the ""Nutella"" in the name of the desert -- forget that - it's the most delicious hazelnut mousse taste, and it works!   Service was very attentive and timely, but not overbearing. The atmosphere is noisy but delightful.  Will definitely go back for more."
test_2268,"Where do I start? I have certainly tasted better than a place like this. Fries were iffy; a lot of them were burnt to a crisp. We placed a simple order for 6 different burgers because of all the great reviews we were getting about them. So, we'd figure to give it a shot. I didn't see what all the hype was about. We ended up with 1 burger being done correctly. which was a plain cheeseburger. All the others they said,"" they were all everything on it."" It was not what we were expecting. We used their website to generate a list for our special order due to food allergies. After we received the order back from us picking it up, 5 of the 6 burgers were wrong, and the folks couldn't enjoy them because they were allergic to the toppings they decided to put everything on it. They can be rest assured that we are not going to come back to them. I hate giving 1 star reviews but i adhere caution to those who are trying this for the first time. I hope you receive better service and quality than we did."
test_2269,"I went in Tuesday looking for a new Taco Tuesday spot and definitely found my new place. It was delicious and my buddy and I had a great time . The food was delicious and the beer cold. A super solid selection of tequilas turned a great meal into a definite danger will robinson night. All around a wonderful time and the bartender (I think her name was Michael Ann) was hilarious. I will be back on Tuesdays and any other time I need some tacos and wonderful times. Kudos Cien, you have a new regular!"
test_2270,"This place is like a pinball museum with so many different pinball machines, but you can actually play the games here. I am so glad that I finally came here. My husband and I came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded. I immediately exchanged a $5 for quarters right when I got there and we played a ton of fun games for 2 hours (not bad for $5 of entertainment for 2). The games are from $0.25 to $0.75 per play. The older games are $0.25 and are actually really amazing to see how they still run and how they work.

Not only are there pinball games, but there are also old school joystick arcade games here as well and other old relic style games. I love that there are index cards on most of the games here so you can read a little bit of the fascinating history over how the pinball hall of fame acquired the games in their possession. Some of the stories are pretty interesting. 

Some of the games at this place are just really cool. I have never played some of these games or seen some of the type of games before at other arcades or the one arcade that reminds me of the place on Fisherman's Wharf (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mus%C3%A9e-m%C3%A9canique-san-francisco-4). 

Will come back here the next time I am here (by the way, this place is pretty close by the strip and is located in a plaza with a camera shop)."
test_2271,"We had heard how good this place was and got to the airport a little early so decided to partake while we waited for our plane. It was quite busy, but we were seated quickly and the waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink order. When he returned with our drinks we were ready to order our food. We ordered a couple of different pies (pizza) to share. One came out fairly quickly but the other was missing. Our waiter, Ryan, quickly realized the oversight and addressed it directly by apologizing and promising to get the other pie out as quickly as possible. After a few minutes our pie still hadn't arrived and our waiter told us he was still working on it and would take care of us. A couple of minutes later he delivered the other pie and also brought his manager by to also apologize and let us know that they would comp both pies. It was unfortunate we had this mixup, but they handled it directly and graciously and you can't ask for better than that! To top it off the pies and the drinks were delicious!! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the Phoenix area!!"
test_2272,"The eggslut, something akin to coddled egg over mashed potato is a great concept. The execution of it on my visit didn't quite arrive as advertised.
The egg was cooked perfectly well. I had to maneuver my way back to the cook station for salt and pepper. The chives and salt were missing from my order, salt and pepper were not on the tables. ??? Eggslut is a really busy place so I wasn't too happy working my way back through the crowd.
The mashed potato:good flavor if watery.
The fresh orange juice didn't taste fresh. I said to my companion that the flavor was exactly the same as a well-known frozen orange juice concentrate. ???
My friend liked her Gaucho Sandwich order.

I'd definitely go again. Next time I'll double check my order before sitting down to enjoy breakfast.

4 stars for the concept, up vibe, great people-loving staff. Short on execution and price."
test_2273,"AMAZING!!!!!!

I could leave it at that, but I won't. This is hands down the best restaurant in Brooklin!!

I have eaten here several times and it has been fantastic each and every time!
Ambiance 10+, Service 10+, and Food 11+


From apps to entrees this place has nailed its quality down, the micro brews on tap are sure to please too!
 The salads are incredible, I have to say I have never had a better one anywhere... and these aren't your cheap ""chef salad"" or ""Caesar"" in fact they don't have either.

Wine selection is priced well, could do with a few more ""mid"" priced selections but the owners are super friendly and aim to please, so no doubt they will up the selection soon."
test_2274,"This company built a pond for me in 2013. Last December, I used them for a pond cleaning. The employee told me I should purchase a chlorine duck or swan filled with a chlorine tab to help keep the pond clean. I went out and spent $150 for these articles. A couple of months later, my pump went out. Only then, after researching, did I discover that chlorine likely caused the pump to not work by burning the seals. I asked them to come out and change the pump which I was willing to pay for. An appointment was scheduled (the usual window of time). I waited and waited but no one came and no one called. Calls to the office went to a machine. The next day, I was told the worker did not come because he failed to bring a pump with him. When I asked why there was no phone call to me, I received no reply. Another appointment was scheduled. Unbelievably, they broke this one as well. I then spoke to the owner, Holly, who said she understood why I was upset and guaranteed they would come out the next morning. Guess what?  I did get a call but the person told me they were not coming that morning because they were busy with something else. He told me they could come between 4:00-5:00. That's not both what I wanted or what was agreed upon with the owner. A week later, we scheduled a fourth appointment and they did show up. Did the work but gave me zero break on the bill for my wasted time. However, this isn't the worst part. When they did m pond, the liner was not it in correctly meaning it was not cut straight (even their worker said it was done wrong). High in some parts and low in others. Water cannot go above the liner so what I have is a half-full pond. Back in December, I took photos and sent them to Holly asking her to make this right. Received no response. This time, I asked again and received no reply. A third email was sen. I told Holly I would take the place of one of her workers to help out with the expense. She finally answered me and said they would do it for nearly $2K!!  Warning to everyone:! If you plan on getting a pond for your yard, and expect great customer service, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"
test_2275,"I recently started renting a unit at this storage facility, and have been impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the convenient location. But after only going to the facility twice, I am considering switching to a different location because of how dangerous the ramp to the building is. Both times I've been there I have caught my foot and almost fallen on the unsecured wire mesh on the wooden ramp while bringing things into and out of the building. The ramp is several feet off the ground, so falling off the ramp would be awful, but could easily happen given how dilapidated it is.

This would be a simple fix for the management. As it is now, this is really very dangerous and doesn't give a good impression about the facility as a whole.

Also, later evening hours would be much better, rather than just until 6pm."
test_2276,"I had the displeasure of attending a wedding reception at Our Lady of The Cedars and it was a huge disappointment.  The cook was an obnoxious, loud, rude jerk who treated people like garbage.  He yelled at staff in front of the guests, called the bride a sexist profainty to her face, was awful to the bartenders, DJ and cake baker.  On top of that his food was awful.  The man felt compelled to coat everything in paprika because he is a lazy horrible cook.  I do not in any way recomend this facility, what a joke."
test_2277,"Amazing piercing shop! I had a great experience, very professional! I highly recommend getting any piercing here."
test_2278,"I've been an Alchemy regular since I moved to Charlotte three years ago! I have friends who are Paul Mitchell educators who knew the owner, also a Paul Mitchell gal and referred me to the salon! Taylor and Kyle are the most amazing owners and really care about every guest. I've gone from dark brown, to light brown, to blonde, and back around, and they've always made it fantastic while keeping my hair happy and healthy :) not to mention I'm able to have a cold beer on tap! It's my happy place for sure!"
test_2279,"We came here on a hot evening to relax on the patio. We ordered drinks and burgers. The slider burgers were ok. I felt like they were missing something. It was only burger, cheese and bun. Maybe a pickle or mayonnaise would have made them more appealing. The drinks were good. We ordered cocktails and they were a bit on the lighter side with alcohol."
test_2280,"Horrible 14 day return policy, even on gifts. And my product was broken when I opened it. Bull shit for such a big corporation. I'll shop elsewhere for my electronics from now on."
test_2281,"Good store, great deals but there can be more on the sales floor. The staff can be a little more friendly. Seems like you disturbed their day. I asked a few ladies for help and the attitude was like ughh. The men are gentlemen."
test_2282,"I'm not a big sushi eater, but what I ate was delicious!  Got the california rolls (yes, I am not adventurous) and shrimp tempura. Yummmmm.  This place is kinda pricey, and this is the first time I've ever paid $5 for ""japanese long-grain rice"".  It's ok though, I was on vacation, so it was ok to splurge. I also had the tastiest lychee martini, complete with a liquor soaked lychee at the bottom!  

I also heard some amazing house music being played here while we ate our dinner.  Probably the best I heard all weekend."
test_2283,"I have been calling local business that provide sewing and alteration services to compare prices. The lady who answered the phone was short and impatient. I asked if the establishment would be able to ""sew two queen size flat sheets together and what the price for this is"" and I received an astonishing reply of ... $75 Are you out of your mind? That price is more than buying a brand new duvet cover. I've received the service of sewing flat sheets together before and the average price for the service with button holes has been $25-$35 Please attempt to know your competition and be somewhat competitive."
test_2284,"Was here for the Mayweather vs Mcgregor, the venue is beautiful. You have your ticket you go to your designated area and enjoy the show simple."
test_2285,"Great food, great customer service and decent prices! They know how to work with large parties and even with such a large group coming in they stayed on top of their game keeping us happy and keeping the food and drinks coming!"
test_2286,The worst for getting you there on time.  And I'm not talking small delays but big delays into the wee hours of the next day.  This is on more than one occasion too. The only saving grace is that the employees are very nice.  That's where the one star comes from
test_2287,"Super good Thai food !! Once you come here you'll never go to Pei Wei again ! Smells DELISH upon walking in , friendly service , clean modern atmosphere .. Decent prices , food is fresh and Taste amazing ! We had the Chicken pad Tai , Mu Yang (the guy Fieri item ) and a couple drinks , highly recommend the leeche martini. Can't wait to come back to try something new :)"
test_2288,"Amazing service, awesome properties, and an excellent check-in/check-out system make 702 Housing an excellent resource for anyone in need of temporary, furnished housing.  Whether you are relocating (like myself) or in town for a duration (like most of my trade show clients), 702  offers a great option to those seeking to live outside the suitcase lifestyle.  

Adam was awesome.  When I found my permanent housing solution 3 weeks prior to my scheduled end lease date, he hustled to find a tenant, and delivered.  Not only did I get my full deposit back, but I also received a check for the the unused days (once the new tenant moved in).  Classy. 

I will use 702 Housing for all my employees relocating to, or visiting, Las Vegas, and I highly recommend their services to anyone in need of a ""home"" while staying in Las Vegas."
test_2289,"Soooooo bomb and staff is very friendly. From the sweet to savory flavors we loved them all, all homemade. Very busy on the weekends, it's a small quaint spot so it felt a little crowded but we took it as a good sign."
test_2290,"Wanting to try thier breakfast after a pleasant dinner there the night before, I had to give the bartender my order for the rest. part of the hotel as it was not ready yet to receive me at 8 a.m.  I was told to just go in and a server would take care of me in a bit. So I sat there waiting a good half hour while a nervous waiter was busy doing his opening chores being completely ignored. This went on for more than a half hour and I finally asked where my order was and was rudely told by the guy with a foreign accent "" I didnt take this order"""" and promptly walked away! I showed him my reciept (which I paid for already at the bar with ""Mr Charming""). Which rude waiter took with no apology whatsoever . Apparently ""Mr Charming"" forgot to tell ""Snotty guy"" I had ordered thier over priced muffin breakfasts and coffee earlier. 
  After ANOTHER 20 minutes STILL nothing..not a fork, not a spoon not a ""hey would like some coffee?""I had better service in a Burger King. I did something I have NEVER done before..I walked out! Save your money on the hospitality of Vegas other great fine dining experiences. And to the snotty waiter..Im a great tipper and I may also suggest you go into something other than the public sector as a career. I will NEVER go back to this establishment (nor my friends if I can help it)."
test_2291,"I stop here often for freshly brewed decaf coffee. It's always on pour-over so I have to wait a few minutes, but, hey, it's fresh. Sometimes I splurge on a seasonal latte or a flat white, but generally speaking, it's the best tasting coffee within walking distance to my house, so they get my business. This place is always busy, but they make sure to take care of you. It's much appreciated."
test_2292,"I eat here alot because I work close, and over 5 years their food has stayed consistently good.  They give you large portions, the pricing is pretty standard, and the few things that are my favorits are the best between the 3 vietnamese restaurants that are all in a row.  I can personally vouch for their crispy spring rolls and chicken cabbage salad... everyone in my office agrees they get our vote for those two dishes, plus many more that I can't pronounce or spell.  :)"
test_2293,"I have been seeing Selena for a few months.   She is incredibly talented. It's so difficult to find a consistent hair cut.  She is flawless ever single time.  The very first cut she even explained to me how to work around my cowlicks, how she'll blend them with the cut, and how to style it day to day. On top of how incredible Selena is, I'd really like to give a huge shout out to their receptionist! (Sorry I don't know your name, I keep meaning to ask!) Ever since my first time in, she recognizes me when I walk in.  She even knows that I'm always there for Selena.   My first hair cut was right before my wedding, and I love that she asks about how married life is.   I work with the public and see so many faces in a day.   It's soooo hard to get everyone straight.  How this woman remembers so much detail is seriously a talent."
test_2294,"Good food and quantity but the service and venue could use some work. The chicken was moist and well grilled, the potatoes were done perfectly and the rice was fresh. However there was not much flavor in the chicken and the hot sauce was as someone else said just Frank's Red Hot diluted. I despise it when restaurants do this, wing joints do this as well for their ""hot"" flavor and I'm tired of downing salty wanna be hot sauce. The portions were huge for the price which was great but  that can't make up for a less than clean eating area and shoddy service.
 
There were only two large tables available outside one of which was occupied by an employee with her feet up on the chair chatting obnoxiously on her cell phone while having her lunch. All while customers were lined up out the door and some waiting for somewhere to sit. I was rushed by the people at the counter and they were definitely not friendly. When  I did manage to get a seat outside the chatty employee was still there talking so loud I had trouble continuing a conversation at my own table. This was followed by another employee coming outside and having an argument with her about scheduling followed by me having to fend-off a cat that jumped up on the table to eat my food. I think next time I'll just do take out because the food really wasn't that bad. 

Anyway that was my experience, but I will visit again if I'm in the mood for pigging out on Portuguese chicken. Note: There is an extra charge for debit."
test_2295,"Not a fan of Hertz. My first impression of this was the guy who was giving me my car trying to almost double my car rental price. He asked me how many people I had (one) and how many bags I had (one traveling backpack and one computer backpack), and he claimed he found a car that suits my needs. It was spacious and had good mileage, and it also almost doubled my car rental price. I was thinking, I have ONE person, how is it being more spacious fitting my need? When I saw the price, I was pretty shocked and said when I booked online, it wasn't that expensive. He said some things that made me think that I didn't pay attention to whether it included taxes and fees, but looking back, I know the price I saw online did include taxes and fees. I basically had to tell him to find a car with just the base price (this car he found for me cost $12 or so more per day because of ""vehicle upgrade""). BUT, he tried yet AGAIN and found a car that cost $6 more per day because of vehicle upgrade. I REALLY don't like how they try to squeeze more money out of you.

Finally, after taking MUCH longer than it otherwise should have, he gave me a car that matched the price I paid for online. Mind you, this was when I picked up the car. 

The car itself was fine, though it was bad at accelerating. Other than that, no complaints about the car; no problems except that the key had self-locking issues or something, the doors would lock on its own randomly. I never really figured that out. In any case, I'm not a fan of Hertz; really bad first impression, and I'm not going to use Hertz again."
test_2296,"Love this dinner.  Wonderful chef Rudy really cares about his food and his customers.  Support this family run business and have a nice, romantic dinner with the one your love!"
test_2297,My best friend is in town visiting and she picked lazy dog to go to for dinner and we just happened to end up with Alejandro as our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. He was so full of life and energy he even sang to us a couple Disney songs. The food was absolutely amazing and the drinks were on point. The service was fast we absolutely had a blast. It was a great night.
test_2298,"This place was just alright.   I expected much better quality food being that it was in the Venetian.  We had dinner here and then breakfast the following day.  We ordered the burrata an tomato as an appetizer with a flatbread for dinner.  The appetizer was good, just not $14 worth.  It was a very small portion.  Only three slices of tomato.  The flatbread was not a flatbread at all, it was just a pizza.  It was under cooked and lacked flavor.  The next day, we were looking to find breakfast on a Sat at 11:30 am and most places had stopped serving breakfast, except for this place.  The breakfast was so bad.   We thought we were getting a good deal by ordering the combo that had eggs, hash browns, bacon/sausage, pancakes/ french toast and toast. I mean how can you go wrong with the basics?  Apparently it's really hard to cook hash browns, so they serve lil frozen triangles, the kind you might find at La Quinta Inn's continental breakfast.  The toast was gross, and they served really old bread that crumbled, and the pancakes were two silver dollar bland nothingness."
test_2299,got the trio dip as an appetizer which came out in less than a minute with stale chips. Really hate feeling like i was served something that was just out for God knows how long. we requested more chips/pita which came out  25 minutes later with our mains. Was not checked up on once we actually had to call a waitress to even get our bill. Food was OK portions were good. Unfortunately the snotty service and atmospere left me with a bad enough taste in my mouth to write a review. Wont be back.
test_2300,"Nothing to get excited about. The food was a bit over priced, chicken was dry with the meat it's self being tasteless, the breading and seasons were not very good to begin with and over cooked on top of that (I think only seasoned with paprika). I ordered the bacon cheese French fries. I had a few but ultimately wished I had just not ordered them. 
What is sad is that we saw this place on the directory and were pretty excited to have some good fried chicken. We walked a way wishing that we had eaten ANYWHERE ELSE. like 7- Eleven for a hot dog now sounds better to me."
test_2301,"Just had lunch here.  The service was very good.  The food was served relatively fast.  And it was very good.  I had the pad thai, the wife had the oranged seared chicken and both were fantastic.

The daughter had the California mango rolls.  I'm not a roll fan but these were very good!!

I'll definitely come here again"
test_2302,"I had been to Spoon and Fork in Vaughan and Etobicoke and have really enjoyed them so I was excited to learn about the new location on York Mills. We went on the second day of opening. I was curious why this was called Spoon and Fork PLUS. Turns out it is because not only is it Thai and Japanese, they also have Italian dishes and even a couple if Indian items too. It seems a bit weird to have all of this in one place but I think they feel this can justify the premium. 

Spoon and Fork is an all you can eat restaurant and as with more and more AYCE places lately, it is order off a menu - not a buffet which is nice as everything is made to order. The menu is very extensive and the food comes in appetizer size so that you can try many items. 

I personally enjoyed the high quality sushi and Spicy Rolls. Our group also liked the tempura shrimp and a number of other great dishes. The waitress was helpful in guiding us through the extensive menu. 

Overall, a very delicious meal. At $30, it's a bit more expensive that the other AYCE places in the area which are around $20-26. But I would recommend to give the place a try."
test_2303,I went in to see Larry (Mr. Sew and Vac) today and he told me my sewing machine did not need to be serviced unless it wasn't sewing correctly.  I was so surprised that anyone would be that honest.  He was honest rather than just trying to take my money.  I will definitely go back to him in the future if I have problems with my sewing machine or vacuum!
test_2304,"Quite possibly the most disappointing taco bar ever.  Looked promising on the outside.  Street tacos were skimpy on the protein portions,  way too sweet of garnish in most cases, and the grilled fish taco was incredibly bitter.  We loved this concept at Joyride Tacos but not so much here."
test_2305,"Came in last night for my gfs 21st birthday. We had dinner at yard house and the plan was to have drinks and dessert here after.... We should have just stayed at YH. 

My Gf had a reservation all set up, they even called to confirm with her a few days ago. When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server ""they didn't even have a reservation"" it's not like we needed one, there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied, and for good reason...

I've dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location. The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card. Our table was being completely ignored. I've been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for. I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there's but nothing. It never happened. It really put a damper on the night. 
There are so many places in Vegas especially to celebrate your 21st and we chose here... But we will never make that mistake again. I would be much happier paying full price for the other location or somewhere else entirely."
test_2306,Horrible service and horrible company. My internet dropped on a friday so I called customer service and they said that the earliest they can send a technician was Monday!! What ? There is a line issue at your end and you're telling me that there is no way you can resolve it sooner? I have my exams and have my practice tests online. I ask the customer serivce rep on the phone 'what am I gonna do for 3 days' and he gives me a reply 'I dont know what you're gonna do for 3 days but I cannot send anyone before Monday'. Done! Will switch to some other provider next week
test_2307,"My heart skipped a beat when I saw the ""Coming Soon"" sign because we frequent the Rainbow location about once a month. Although this location is quick casual, they don't miss a beat with the quality and flavor. The menu is not as extensive as their full service restaurant, but includes all their favorites. Our must haves are tom kha, pad thai, spicy basil with fried egg, and chicken panang curry. I just wish they had a couple of dessert items or offered a few boba drinks. No worries, we'll always be back!"
test_2308,"Though I am middle aged and generally wary of anything ""family friendly"", my fiancee and I loved this.  I was much happier with the seats and performance than with Penn and Teller.  As someone who has performed an illusion or two, I thought Mac's performance was flawless.  By far the best solo performance I've seen in Vegas of any kind.  Will definitely go again and figure out how to reward someone who could clearly charge more but keeps the cost down for families.  My fiancee found that Mac exuded the most positive ""goodness"" she has seen, and I agree that nobody's presence has reminded me more of Yoda's statement ""luminous beings are we, not this crude matter""."
test_2309,"I've been here several times, and every time I go, I am not disappointed! I am a sweet person, so the raspberry cheesecake crepe is my favorite! I will continue to take clients here for a nice treat."
test_2310,"I originally ate at one down in LA, and decided to try this one to see how it compares. In the meantime, I have eaten at Pieology and Mod Pizza, and thought that neither of them could compete with 800's crust. My suggestions: order the original crust, not the crispy. If you're ordering salad, ask for the dressing on the side, or ask for light on the dressing. I would love to try their broccolini as a side dish. I had it as a topping and really liked it. Also if you're ordering a side or salad, you might consider splitting one pizza for two people, unless you're really hungry. I wish they would open one of these back home!!!"
test_2311,"This place ROCKS! Every time I've been has been excellent service and excellent food! Today we had the corn fritters, which were out of this world, and a veggie pad Thai. Absolutely delicious! I also had a Kirin light which was ice cold and sooooo good. I found out today that they also offer gift cards which  is very cool!"
test_2312,"I went to safelite when someone smashed my back windshield in. I thought I was going to a legit company and thought they would fix my window like they say they do. 
When I bought my brand new 2015 car, I drove it off the lot with tinted windows. It came like that. 
First of all, I paid Safelite for an exact match of the window I had. My insurance didn't cover it, and it was not cheap at all. They gave me a window that didn't even fit my car, let alone match my car. There are gaps everywhere and broken glass underneath the new window. 
It's also not tinted. When I called them, the first guy I talked to said that I was just trying to get a free window tint from then and they aren't going to help me. I also asked about the $20 discount they advertise on the recording when you call their shop. He told me he didn't know what I was talking about, they don't offer any kind of discounts, and if I want my window tinted I can go somewhere else and pay for it because they aren't going to help me with that. 
He transferred me to a lady that seemed like she was going to get me the right window. She too me that the guy that came to replace it had notated that it was the wrong window for my car and that they need to order the correct one and come install it for me. Well it turns out she was just telling me what I wanted to hear because when I called today they said they aren't doing anything for me.
I hate your company more than I can ever put into words. You screwed me over and stole my money. I thought I could trust a reputable company like yours.i could have paid a whole in the wall company to do a better job than you. Aren't you supposed to have satisfaction gaurantee? Aren't you supposed to have people working there that know how to treat customers. You guys should seriously learn what CUSTOMER SERVICE is. It's when you treat customers like human beings and don't make them feel like garbage. 
When I was on the phone with your rep, Joe, he told me that I would get an exact match with the exact tint I already had. That's why I paid you guys so much. Your calls are recorded so pull it up and listen to what you promised me. You are nothing but liars and I will let everyone I talk to know not to ever use your company. You make promises to get the business and then give us crap. Your work was garbage. The window does not fit. That is not he window I paid for!!! It has gaps 
And then you have the audacity to call me a liar! Never again. Your company is horrible"
test_2313,"My hubby took me here for my birthday. We found this place via groupon, but they honored the groupon deal in store so we could pay cash. It's a very small place, but much nicer than I expected. The ambiance is very relaxing, and the massage therapists were very sweet! I would of liked a bit more of a deep tissue massage, but I also didn't really ask. My husband, on the other hand, asked for more pressure and said he ended up getting a great massage and felt released. Overall, we enjoyed our experience here and would go back! :)"
test_2314,"We like going to Artisano on Dundas West. They have really good sandwiches, salads, soups and pastas. I particularly like their cannelloni. It's served piping hot with crusty toast on the side. Yum! We've had their pizza a couple of times and had tried the whole wheat crust as well. I prefer the regular crust though. They also have a selection of desserts to go with your coffee. The service is good and ambiance is pretty nice. They have free wi-fi, too."
test_2315,"Here's the thing, there's a couple things I know to be certain, Number One, when I called you the first time and told you what I needed I told you I was more concerned about quality then I was price, I got the ""pitch"" ""all 8 trucks, etc"". Told you I wanted coil, everything basically. You recommend Dryer, I said do it. The house had just been remodeled this was the last piece of it. Day of cleaning, your employee arrived on time and started, I dropped in as I work close, he was up stairs with the drill snake, hepa vac was connected to large vent in living room, first thing I noticed was the 10+ inch tear in the in the vent pipe running into the hepa vac, and essentially the dust build up next to Machine from the whole. Next I go upstairs to find Technician with His filthy shoes and ladder feet on the brand new carpet. Needless to say not really impressed so far. Job done, paid. Now a week or so later we move in, having dryer issues? Has to be dryer right because supposedly I hired a team with 30 some years of experience and of course eight trucks so I can't be the dryer vent plugged, right. So I pay for my home warranty to come check dryer and low and behold dryer vent plugged. Now you want to talk over me and tell me some bullshit excuse, you tell me you had to take an hr which you didn't have to research, well guess what pal I don't have the time to go through dealing home warranty, not having a dryer for a week and a half all because your first guy did a halfass job. Now the second guy rolls out. Basically does the same thing, runs the drill snake out the whole way, gets a little, we now go looking for the outlet to run it back the other way, we find outlet with lint and shit pack in it, he scoops it out goes inside puts the shop vac in reverse stuffs in a rag to seal it come outside to ""feel"" it's clear. At the end of the day your service is bullshit and your personally a joke with your 8 trucks, who gives a shit. Maybe you need to get your ass out of the office, check your guys and your equipment. I had a concrete cutting and coring biz for yrs and would have been out of biz had I ran it like you run yours"
test_2316,"My experiences with pita jungle and all their locations have been nothing but pleasant. I grew up with this kind of food, being of Armenian and Iraqi background the food is delicious. Yeah a few tweaks here and there to attract the American consumer but all done with great taste. This is not my first time at this location as my work peeps like to come here, last time we were there at lunch rush hour and boy it was busy, and our table was over 10 people. This time It was with a smaller group and I got the grilled vegetable salad and added 5 pieces of falafel and it was one amazing combination. The grilled eggplants and zucchini were tasty with the mix of the leafy greens and tahini drizzle a vegan, and tasty dish for sure. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and gave us refills to go on our drinks. We also went when it was slow but I can tell you even if you go to this location on a busy day at a busy time, they will take good care of you. Keep doing the great job you do there guys."
test_2317,Love this place.  Very tasty Chinese food. Decent prices.  Fairly fast service. Family owned. What panda express should be.
test_2318,This location is awesome! I always come here for tire rotations and balances and they have great customer service. The staff is really knowledgable and professional.
test_2319,"Yes, this is an offshoot of a Pittsburgh business, but you'll soon get over it if you're a fan of craft beer and fatty food. The menu is huge and covers just about every category of stuff that goes well with beer. The Headwiches are appropriately named, the smoked wings delectable and enormous, and the pizza just right. Sandwiches come with really nice house-made chips. As for the beers, I'm partial to the Goggle Fogger Hefeweizen and the blueberry ale, but I haven't had a bad one yet. My sole complaint about the place is that service has never really been impressive. Last night, I was the last to join my party, and I waited 10 minutes before someone came by for my beer order. I was about to send up flares to get our server's attention. My evening finished with the to-go portion of my order being incorrect. Not a terrific way to inspire loyalty.

So, Fat Head's isn't my first choice for my food and beverage needs due to the lackluster service, but there's a certain group of beer-swilling friends I meet on a regular basis that finds this a convenient meeting place, so I'm willing to keep coming back. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could, but we'll say that the presence of the bar bowling machine bumps it up to 4."
test_2320,"I haven't been to Vegas since March, so it's been a while since eating here, but for some reason - I have no idea why - I was just thinking about the calzone that I get at Wolfgang Puck's every time I go there.  It's probably the best calzone that I've ever had and I've eaten my fair share of calzones.  Perfect crust - not too flaky, not too thick.  Lots of delicious cheese  and plenty of chicken and whatnot.  

The first time we ate here we were both hot and tired and cranky and hungry and had wandered around New York New York and the MGM Grand and no food option sounded good.  Finally we decided to try Wolfgang Pucks and we were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding calzone and, of course, the Maytag bleu cheese potato chips.  It instantly made us feel better and we were able to continue on. 

I'm a little bummed, I'm hungry for a calzone.  But I won't be back in Vegas for quite some time and it doesn't look like any of the affordable Puck locations in Los Angeles serve them.  Hmmm....must think of an excuse."
test_2321,"Yummy food. Good price. Had the carne asada, pastor, and carnitas taco.  My favorite was the carne asada and pastor.  The cashier was hard to understand but very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was pretty warm.  I will come back."
test_2322,"(+)ves 
I love the way the place looks (they renovated it) - very Indian!
Lunch specials are decent.
On Craig - very close to CMU n UPitt.

(-)ves
Very rare that it turns out to be a quick meal.
Less quantities for the prices they charge."
test_2323,"I've been here a couple of times and had a pretty good meal both times. I think the food is consistently good (not amazing) and the prices are fairly low for what they give you. I don't recall the items I ordered (we were sharing as a table) but I think the veggies were the best courses. Also, the place is quite vegetarian-friendly. The wine selection is small, but the wines are interesting."
test_2324,"This place has been here as long as I can remember....drove past it for over 15 years in my travels around the valley.  Walking in feels like a hotel lobby with the awkward bathroom cleaner scented candle burning. The place is huge and can handle a group of any size.  Timing from greeting/beverages to appetizers to entrees was good.  Plates show signs of wear which make them appear dirty and the furniture is dated and a bit worn. The dishes were definitely scratch made and it was nice to sit down and have a nice meal. Tried the seafood mix plate with vegetables, papaya salad, and chicken satay...... Next time the soup. Definitely a nice local place to get some authentic Thai food."
test_2325,"I do not recommend this place.. I went with my wife and some friends on Friday night to celebrate my wife's promotion and got racial profiled by the guy checking ID's I was wearing shorts and a plain black tee and when I got to the front of the line the bouncer told me ""your shorts are too baggy"" then proceeded to tell me that they dont allow black tees in the place. I looked around and half the people inside were wearing solid tees and also the gentleman behind me was also wearing a black tee but was able to go in with no issues. I felt just because I'm a Mexican guy with a bald head and tattoos I was profiled as a gang banger and was not allowed to get in to a so called ""Mexican"" restaurant. Never judge a book by its cover people. I'm a dad of 5 kids and husband to a beautiful wife. I own my own home and make decent money but because of the way I look I wasn't allowed to get in. I will never be going to this place again and ill make sure to spread the word on how I was treated."
test_2326,"The Goods
1. Pizza is average, conveniently located.  It was hard to say if there was a good understanding of the choices since the person greeting us didn't explain anything.  Just uttered something about traditional crust and barely looked in our general direction.  (See service)
2. Thinner crust, chewy, selections of toppings, similar to a lot of other ""pizza craft"" restaurants

Ambiance
1. Spacious, good amount of seating. 
2. I like that this one (possibly others) has a Coca-Cola Freestyle to make various flavored drinks

Service
1. This is where the 2/5 stars comes in
2. From the initial greeting with the ""something -something"" crust offering to the end it was not great.  I had to ask twice/thrice since the person choosing the crust to get things started had a poor attitude.  Practically snipped words I could barely make out and looked annoyed when I wasn't able to catch the words to make sense of what she is saying.  No guidance on how to pick toppings.  
3. At the cashier, I had to wait for a very long time as some guy never greeted me but passed by a multitude of times and never looked my way even though I was holding a credit card and clearly needed to pay.  Thought crossed my mind that perhaps this business prefers to just GIVE pizzas away.
4. There was a snafoo with an ""unidentified pizza"" floating around which involved almost all the staff and manager to figure out why one customer got the wrong pizza and one unclaimed pizza.  I have to reiterate it all starts with the initial encounter where a friendly employee NEEDS to politely ask for names and properly write it on the paper like they do at Blaze or Pieology.  And yet the entire business had to come to practically a halt due to the pizza mixup.
5. manager presented ""my"" pizza to me but questioned me along the lines of ""Isn't this your pizza"".  I am not sure why it so difficult to identify the pizzas here.  On top of that, he was not friendly, did not smile and treated me as if he was annoyed with me rather than concerned about customer service and experience.
6. One young female employee (did not catch name) came around and checked on us.  If it wasn't for her, I would say the service is terrible.  

MoJo/JuJu
1. I am not sure I will go back here unless necessary.  Maybe it was a bad day or bad time.  I was always told poor management leads to poor staff.  Find another ""BYO-build your own pizza"" joint if you can there ARE others.  (been here twice btw and both times so-so)"
test_2327,Location & atmosphere! The Brussels sprouts and the pork belly bowls are delish. Super tiny in there though so always a short wait.
test_2328,"I heart the Noble Beast! It's owned by awesome people that truly want the best for your fur kids. They are very engaged in their products they sell. The special order for me monthly, which is so nice that they are willing to order in products for me that they don't carry. I highly recommend them to anyone that wants special attention for their pets. Oh, and they host many events throughout the month..community engagement is my passion."
test_2329,"I was referred to them a while back by another carrier..  I went there and dealt with Carl who fixed my husbands screen for cheap.  He was great. I went back to purchase a iphone 5 for my daughter for christmas, he gave me a great deal and also fixed her screen for her iphone4 so i can use.  He also showed us how to transfer all our information and went above and beyond what he should of done.  I went back to him again yesterday because my phone went black and didn't have a phone for 2 days.  Carl fixed it within two minutes and didn't even charge me.. I highly recommend this place ( especially Carl) and I wont go any where else :)"
test_2330,Really great rolls. Best I think I have ever had. My friend had the curry and he said it was the best he had ever had as well. The staff was friendly well informed and great at what they do. Had a calm relaxing time with a small group and it was the best food I have had in Vegas so far.
test_2331,"Our server was Stella. I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. We had avocado egg roll and fried calamari for our appetizers, which was very good! The egg roll was surprisingly very delicious. I got their newest (?) cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake. It was on the sweet side, so if that's what you're going for I'd give it a try.
Our server was more than happy to give us advice on our entrees. We came on a Friday during Valentines weekend for a friend's birthday. At first she forgot to sing happy birthday for our friend, but it worked out in the end. It was quite busy, but we got seated within 20-30 minutes. We had a party of 7, we sat in a 6 person booth and they added a seat to the end.  It took about 20 minutes for us to receive our main entrees. Thank you Stella for giving us great service ."
test_2332,"My husband always goes here for his haircuts and he always look very sharp and fresh!

I  went a few months ago to get my eyebrows threaded while my husband was getting his usual haircut. I wasn't happy with the results at all. The woman made my skin scraped and very red and irritated wherever she threaded. It took a full day for the redness to go away :( and the cost was much higher than other reputable places in Brampton. I will be sticking to my usual eyebrow lady.

For men's cuts I would give this place a full 5 stars, but for the threading I would give it 2 stars."
test_2333,"I have been to their different branches across a lot of cities and I am amazed by the consistency of their food. It's like the food is prepared by the same person, everywhere 
Absolutely love their food and service. I have tried their seafood trio that consists of 3 items that you can pick from a list of items on the menu and a bunch of main course dishes having shrimp and the taste is amazing. I can say that is one of my favorites for my seafood cravings."
test_2334,Tasteless and  expensive. $12 fruit plate tastes like plastic. And took 30min to prepare an omelette...
test_2335,"They do have some excellent sandwiches, soup and bakery goods.  This particular location always seems to have problems.  Today there was no ice in the ice machine.  It's often hard to find a table that is clean.  

Sometimes the turkey sandwich is excellent and other times it's made with thick, tough grizzled hunks of nasty turkey.  Other times it's very nice, thinly sliced turkey breast.  

If you go here after 2:00 PM this location often they are out of the main sandwiches on the menu day after day. 

Maybe the other locations are better.  I don't know."
test_2336,Great Selection!  Taxes are included in price so their are no surprises.  Flower is fresh!  Merchandise is clutch!!
test_2337,"Went here on a Friday night with three girlfriends and my 85yo gram. We all enjoyed everything we ordered to eat and drink - absolutely delish! Our only downside of the evening was when our server disappeared for about 45 minutes and we were waiting to order dessert...When he finally reappeared, we inquired about desserts - ""...possibly some type of ice cream?"" He looked at us like we were crazy. So we point out that we had seen a guest eating an ice cream cone. *crickets* We then point out the guy eating the ice cream cone and our waiter turns around to see what we are talking about. After he turns around he says, ""Oh! Yes, we have ice cream."" (Sweet....I think we are getting somewhere...)We are finally able to get our hands on a dessert menu and ordered the Toasted Coconut Ice Cream Sundae - Pretty yummy! The ice cream was rather tart and we were looking forward to the coconut whipped cream (which was missing). Honestly, service deserved 2 stars. Food - 5 stars all the way! (The patio is a great place to hang out on a beautiful night!)"
test_2338,"My friend Shirley took a skilled rider course designed solely for experienced riders, this eight-hour 1- or 2-day course she told me it is taught by dedicated Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) and H-D Certified Coaches. Since I'm shopping for a Harley myself, I was enthused over all Shirley had to say about this dealership. So impressed with Shirley's story I wrote a blog post about her and, her story: http://buildingabrandonline.com/realabundance/strategy-for-living-your-passion/
Shirley liked their attitude about the Harley passion of people from all walks of life joining the Harley Riders in this country. She convinced me how they are the ones to teach advanced tips and techniques to help me own the road. For me, before I get out on the open road with my Harley, I'm gonna go to Vegas and visit this shop and take their course. I'm anxious to learn about how they teach control at low speeds, cornering judgement and swerving, and all that I'll need to learn. Shirley told me that when she was done, she not only started riding with more confidence, but enjoyed it even more."
test_2339,"I always go to Midas for all of my car service needs ever since my first experience at Midas in San Diego. Today I had exceptionally good service. Came in for a routine oil change. Picked up my car a couple hours later and noticed there were dirt/grease foot prints on my clean cream colored carpet on the driver side. This was a little upsetting, so I let Luis know of the issue and he did not hesitate to take care of the issue for me. Within minutes I had my car ready to go and my paper work in hand. On top of the great service and attention to detail, Luis comped my oil change to apologize for the delay. This went above and beyond my expectations. I always come here for the great service and quality work, so this just proves that they truly are the best Midas location in town!"
test_2340,"There are bottles from afar,  pints from the local craft stars,  a little cask action, a decent menu and solid staff. Worth a few visits,  even if King + Spadina is out of your way!"
test_2341,"If i could give 6 stars, i would.  hands down the best brisket i have ever had. i have given up all other brisket at this point.  The vibe and the time they take is worth the wait.  People may complain about the wait but i like personal feeling i got as my piece of meat was cut for me. They do every thing right."
test_2342,Fantastic happy hour!Great customer service! A fun chill place to hang out at! Love the the roof top and live music!
test_2343,Our family loves Dairy Queen! The owners and staff are so friendly. They have great service. They are community minded as well. What's not to love!
test_2344,Terrible company.  Beware if you're considering hiring this moving and trashing company.  They'll ruin your goods and house.  That was my experience.  Executive Moving and Storage hire liars as well and they will tell you what you want to hear.  Once they their paid they don't care.  Not a reputable company.  Buyer beware.  I give them 0 stars!
test_2345,"Kent is awesome, he help us purchase a nice watch.  YOU ROCK!!
Thank you, I will differently visit again to purchase some glasses."
test_2346,"Worst company avoid!! I have 2 young children under the age of 3 in my household and have had no ac for 2 days now. Tech said they would order the part and be out Tuesday at the lastest. Called today and now the soonest they can come is Friday. Lol what a joke of a company. Save yourself the headache and call legacy ac or anyone else! 

So they finally fixed my ac after a week and guess what... it broke again! We will be looking at another 5 days without air again! Jon the supervisor claimed to own the company at first then quickly changed his story when I called bs. Why can't I leave negative stars!"
test_2347,We eat here on a regular basis.  It's like that little hole in the wall place that has tasty food for reasonable prices here!  I can't vouch for their full menu... we always get the chicken in spicy garlic sauce... that's it.  They have lunch specials that come with a spring roll and fried or white rice... its delicious... love it.  White meat chicken and lots of veggies.  By hole in the wall I don't mean it in a bad way... these are the places that have the best food a lot of times.  Place always looks decently clean... if decently is even a word... but I love my dish... I would suggest it to anyone.
test_2348,"This is my first and last time. I looked at the yelp reviews and thought it would be good for my boys and me and i was mistaken. They gave my oldest an outbreak from dirty clippers. My son has never had a rash like that from getting his hair cut and it went all around the back nape area and up above his ears. My youngest son has straight hair and they cut 2 holes where i can tell his cowlick was. And my hair was cut different on both sides, i had to go home and fix it. For a total of $75! I felt robbed and i wont recommend."
test_2349,"We ate here several months ago and the food and service were fantastic.  We loved the atmosphere and seating,  We returned today for brunch and while the service was top shelf, the food was awful. The staff was very concerned that we did not eat much of our food and comped one meal for us.  However, all the food was terrible.  Our cheese curds were undercooked, cold, and greasy. Our breakfast meal was served with cold, hard eggs and toast.  It was inedible. Another member of our party ordered fries and a burger and ate little of either.  We ended up taking the burger home to our dog.  The fries did not seem to be ""homemade"" either.

The highlight of the food were the chips with onion dip.  Also, they serve truly wonderful coffee.  These were good.

As we had a great previous meal, we will return a third time and give the food another chance.  Maybe it was just an off day...though, it was not very busy."
test_2350,"Defied every expectation... incredible, bar was very very pricey. 4 stars only because I think the prices per portion are out of line high...especially the bar!

Everything was on point... Everything conscientiously thought out and purposeful.  Lighting and ambience...one off the best uses if space, light and textures I've ever seen.  You lose yourself in the ambiance so even if it's busy, it feels intimate.  

Food... well the food was top tier in terms of preparation and technique. Flavors were bright and complex, cooked to PERFECTION!  We had a variety if plates, but the stand outside were the squid, pork chop, and the bronzino.  I assume the pork was done sous-vide and then flash grilled.  Prefect medium rare and yet warm through out.... succulent to the bone literally!

Looking forward to going next time....I well acid the bar though... $16 cocktails is silly for the pour and location."
test_2351,"Today (12/29/17) I went in to get my cracked screen on my phone fixed. The owner was there and repaired my phone in about 10 minutes just as promised. I've never gotten a screen replaced but chose this establishment because they use genuine Apple screens and not the cheap knockoffs. He was so incredibly knowledgeable and went above and beyond. He even tested my phones battery life and condition of my phone. I feel very confident saying that hands down, best and quickest place to get your phone fixed."
test_2352,"I haven't been to an Olive Garden in years.  We used to go to the neighborhood one when I lived in Chicago.  We decided to try this one with friends for a casual dinner.  While the food was very tasty, the bread sticks seemed a little tough to me.  I remember them being very soft and cushiony.  This batch was chewy.  Not sure if they are supposed to be this way, unless it has been such a long time since I had one.  The salad was good, and my husband enjoyed his soup.  The pasta was also nice and the spicy sauce was delicious.  Our server on the other hand must have been having a bad day.  She seemed preoccupied and almost annoyed at having to do her job.  She wasn't always present and asking her for a glass of water almost seemed like a chore.  Perhaps she was having a bad day, and I totally get that, but this is your job and sometimes you have to put on a happy face even though you don't want to.  Other than that, the meal was great!  A good time was had by all."
test_2353,"Just ate at Origin India on Paradise Rd. the food was fresh and not greasy. The staff was very friendly and it was very homey inside. We has the lunch buffet and being vegetarian and gluten free, there was plenty to eat. Highly recommend it if you want a nice, friendly Indian restaurant."
test_2354,"Don't go hungry. Server lost our order and weren't notified until 30mins later after watching other customers, whom arrived after us, received their food before us. Never got our food. Walked outta that rig like a boss. A hungry boss."
test_2355,"Came here with the boyfriend who was skeptical of this place because he doesn't see the difference between going to get his hair cut professionally and the usual me shaving his head  in the kitchen into something that resembles a misshapen-ed salad bowl. 

We came with a Livingsocial deal and our first impression was that it was had a very unique and cool mood going on. The bf lit up at their beer specials and I have to say that for 2 bucks a Stella and everything else, it's a good deal whether or not you come for a haircut. Tried the food and it wasn't anything too special when you could just walk a couple of shops down to TK tavern.

Here's the problem: We came in, told them about the coupon we had, and then we had to wait for a stylist even though there was a stylist just chilling with nothing to do and other walk-ins without the coupon went before us. After our last horrifying groupon experience, this alerted my boyfriend that we were going to get a sh*t-tastic experience here as well because we're 'those with the coupons.' Finally he got a barber, asked for a simple number 3 haircut but to leave the top of his hair long. Instead, the barber just buzzed off all of his hair until he looked like a monk and did an even crappier job shaving off his sideburns, leaving him with patches. We were done in less than 5 minutes whereas everyone else getting their haircut were attended to like they were supposed to.

My boyfriend was embarrassed and just wanted to get out, because it's the second time it's happened we've gotten second-rate treatment because of our 'coupon.' If the owner is a bald guy, then he was there and even directed us to this specific barber who didn't talk or anything, just shaved and was told us he was done. Save yourself the money and go to your local barbershop who will treat you right without the expensive costs and actually listen to your needs without judging you."
test_2356,"This is my very first review. DONT NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE! The working folk here have been great. I am assuming this hotel/casino is managed the same way at all Westgate properties. DO NOT COME HERE! You're money will be utilized much more efficient else where. ""Westgate"" you're automatic Yelp reply is useless here. 


PS no one wants to buy time shares at a half ass resort!"
test_2357,"This restaurant is in a very random location, while we were driving there I kept questioning if we had the right address... However, once we arrived I was pleasantly surprised. The interior of the restaurant is very nicely furnished and the food was delicious. 

The restaurant is very loud, so do be prepared for that. They also pack the table pretty tight."
test_2358,"Inept service and moussaka with no tomato, no seasonings and eggplant almost entirely inedible due to being burnt to the bottom of the pan it was cooked in.

That's not Greek!  Need I say more."
test_2359,"I am so torn with this place as another poster has said. The wait time are great, the front desk staff is wonderful, most of the time the nurses are good, which is the reason for the 2 stars. Last night was a different story. 

The nurse was literally asking me questions as I was attempting to finish his previous one. He was walking out the door as I was still talking. I couldn't believe it. And they weren't busy, like at all. We got in and into a room in less than 10 minutes. We've been a few times and the last two times have been seen by Dr Young. He is awful. My 4 year old has been coughing violently for a week (something we've been dealing with on and off for months). I explained to him that we saw the pediatrician yesterday morning, but that things had gotten worse since coming home. Hence why we are here! He cut me off in the middle of my sentences, made me feel about as stupid as I possibly could, and wouldn't listen to me when I told him everything he currently suggested WAS NOT WORKING. When I asked about a cough syrup for my son (he is coughing to the point of making himself throw up, which I stated) he laughed. He laughed at me, then proceeded to tell me that doctors don't do that sort of thing anymore. I was practically begging for something to make my son comfortable, and he wouldn't listen. 

He ordered an x-ray, which let us know my son had some chest inflammation going on. No kidding! He's violently coughing and complaining his chest hurts. Groundbreaking! He gave my son a teeny, tiny shot of a liquid steroid last night in the room, and they failed to put what he was given or how much on his discharge papers. Currently waiting until they open so I can call and confirm what he was given. We were sent home with an inhaler with the same medication he's been using at home, after I explained that its not working. 

IDK if I will come back to this location. Dr. Young is truly a piece of work, and I can't understand why he is a children's doctor of all things. If you can come and request a different doctor, your experience should be better."
test_2360,"i always walked passed this store whenever i'm at the mall but i finally decided to stop in, and wow there's a lot of things! i mostly went in with the intention to buy some BTS merch, so i got a bt21 koya notepad and a BTS small notebook as well, (the selection wasn't too big but i understood cause the store was mainly for Japanese products.) Other than that, they had a ton of other things! it was as kind of overwhelming but in a good way haha, if i wasn't in such a rush like i was when i went, i would've defiantly bought some snacks and stationary things! :)"

test_2362,"Slowest and worst customer service EVER. 
ALWAYS under staffed always SLOOOW. I am standing in line now theu have been open since 7 am it is 7:10 there are over 10 people checked in at the keyosk and on line waiting for vitals to be taken. There are three  people at the vitals station and they are all talking amongst themselves as 12 people are now in lone waiting. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. They have the monopoly for 2 reasons. We are need the money that badly in this economy and they are the only facility in this area. Shameful."
test_2363,"I wrote a lengthy synopsis's of Enterprise Rental Cars on Boulder Hway but somehow it posted under Rental Car CO's in Henderson or something like that. I'll try to copy and paste it here.

Ah ha, here it is, found it and deleted on other car rental place-no idea where/what it is.

The people that work here are always so helpful so nice so polite I can't say that enough. Not always the case with company's you deal with, often times you're simply a body that walks in and walks out. No one recognizes that you're even there. Today I have to say it was sweet CHRIS. I paid too much and the refund will show up when it hits the bank I think they said. 

Thank you for caring about the consumer, sincerely appreciate it."
test_2364,"By far, way better service than the ones in the Bay Area!  Our waiter, Rachel, was very warm and friendly, and anticipated all of our needs...from drink refills to when our entrees will be ready (""just a few more minutes""), she was never late with anything.  And if you're on a health kick / lifestyle change like me, order the Linguini Marinara.  Even the version with whole wheat noodles was deliciosoo!!"
test_2365,"We ordered  breakfast torta with ham, the ham was salty and thick cut, not my preference, green chili at sauce bar was excellent, breakfast burrito with chorizo was great."
test_2366,"The rooms are of course not 5 star status but you get what you pay for. It has the typical hotel beds and complimentary shampoos. The biggest reason I can not stand this place is their service is awful in the register's table. I understand I am an 18 year old in Las Vegas and I am not even allowed to rent out a room, but if you are going to book a high school level event then expect to have under aged customers. Just because I am young, it doesn't mean you have the right to not treat me like a customer. This place needs new employees for the front desk because they obviously don't have matters. I was in line for a key and they took over 10 minutes to get to the desk BUT, they let the adults behind us go before us. I was very angry at this. Don't accept bookings for a high school event if you are not going to treat the younger customers with respect. When I am 21 , I am surely not coming here again."
test_2367,"The Camp is awesome! Today I finished my first challenge, and it was a success! I'm overwhelmed with happiness! It's been a long 6 weeks, but with the encouragement of my peers and trainers it's been a truly great experience. I'm so thankful for all the people I've met and will continue to meet. I intend on joining the camp as a member and continuing my health goals, I encourage everyone to get out there and give it a go! Yes it's going to hurt, yes you're going to sweat, yes sometimes you may want to throw in the towel, but believe me in the end it's all worth it! I appreciate all the support and empowering words! This is just the beginning! ‚Äç"
test_2368,"You would never know it by the outside (or especially the inside) but this is amazing Chinese food! I have been to this place countless times over the years and it is always consistently awesome.  The sesame chicken, chicken and broccoli, cashew chicken and chow mein are all great, as are their egg rolls.  Great food at a very good (read: cheap!) price."
test_2369,Great location! Things i get are always fresh and the variety of the things you can find is just hard to count; great people who re always ready to help!
test_2370,My husband and I decided to dine at the Bellagio Buffet based on a recommendation of a local resident. Our experience was underwhelming (which is an understatement). It was over priced and offered a selection similar to that of any typical buffet. I would have rather taken the money we spent on the dining experience and spent it in a slot machine.
test_2371,"@@@@@STOP RIGHT HERE@@@@@@ Quit looking for a great carpet repair and best carpet cleaning company of Las Vegas. Rick is a true business owner and takes pride on what he does, above and beyond! Yup,  he repaired a nasty carpet damage (see pics) and made it look like nothing ever happened! The carpet cleaning products he uses are top of the line. He also offers special detail cleaning for all those stains that always show up after few weeks from  getting the carpet shampoo done. He's got OCD. So make sure he's got plenty of space to work and trust me, will never call any other carpet cleaning company ever again. Let's give business to our city,  Rick: best wishes with your company, many success! Hard working family man!... :)  CALL HIM right now. Really. . . Now!"
test_2372,"As someone who was constantly looking up reviews prior to my procedure, I thought it's only fair that I left one after my PRK done with Dr. R. Stein. 

I am a medical student who had been contemplating laser eye surgery for a while now, with my pre-op prescription at -7.75 and -7.50. Although many of my colleagues are hesitant, I felt that the benefit of not having to wear corrective lenses outweighed the potential risk with the surgery. This is a personal decision and many find that corrective lenses are not worth the potential risks. 

I was originally deemed a LASIK candidate, but pre-op scans showed that my cornea was on the thinner side so we went with PRK, which is known to have a longer recovery period. I was actually happy about that as I was told by ophthalmologists that some of the complications are directly related to the flap that is created with LASIK and with PRK, which has no flap, decreases these risks (I am no expert but this is what I had been told). 

On the day of surgery, I saw Dr. Stein for a brief 5 minutes or so. He was nice and calming but I did find that he was very rushed. He answered my questions (knowing that I have a medical background) but with little explaining. His ophthalmology assistant, was much more empathetic and was willing to answer more questions. This would probably be my only complaint and you can't shake the momentary idea of being in a chop shop. 

During the actual surgery, again, Dr. Stein did minimal talking and it was the technicians who explained what was happening. He did say a few words to me near the end and it was comforting but I think he could've done a bit more during the procedure. 

Procedure itself was essentially pain-free. Post-op day 2-3 were the worst, with a lot of swelling and it felt like I was constantly cutting onions with marked tearing and irritation. By day 4 the swelling had reduced and tearing subsided. 

Currently at post-op day 5, I have some light sensitivity and my eyes tire easily. Visual acuity is decent, with some blurry vision but otherwise good! Waiting to get my contact lens removed today so looking forward to see how that changes my acuity. 

Overall, I am happy with the results so far but I think Dr. Stein could make some effort to speak with his patients. Additionally, it is still unclear what the 20+ year complications will be so fingers crossed it will all be okay."
test_2373,"Shabu Shabu Paradise is the shiznit!  I've been here about 5 times over the course of 2 years and it's always been good each time i walk out that door.  Every visit i made it's always been the same sweet, young lady that single handily runs the front of the house. She's very attentive and works very efficient.  I was surprised she even remembered my allergy to peanuts because she brought me my favorite dipping sauce, Miso dressing, without me asking for it.   

Shabu shabu is basically Japanese fondue.  You cook your veggies and meats to your own liking and pair it up with a dipping sauce. 

I usually get the ""Jack"" with beef since it's a perfect amount of meat for me as i take advantage of their unlimited refills on salad.  Your meal also comes with an unlimited amount of delicious white rice.  It's out of the ordinary if i can finish a whole bowl of it to myself, but the rice here taste that much cleaner and fresher.

3 dipping sauce comes with your order:  ponzu, spicy ponzu, and peanut sauce.  However, I think their Miso dressing from their house salad is the best dipping sauce there is with a few little tweaks. First, ask for a side of garlic paste (just a small amount inside the ramekin will pack a huge punch) and dump the whole thing into your Miso sauce. Then load it up with shaved daikons and scallions to give the sauce some thickness.  Mix it around and 'Trust!'

It's a bummer I don't take advantage of their coupons they hand out after the meal because they're so far from me, but i'll never pass up the free dessert!  Small scoop of ice cream with your choice of toppings, strawberries or chocolate. I love this place and i love popping my friends' shabu shabu's cherries here too!"
test_2374,"I can't say enough good things about Deana. Over the last five years, we've moved quite a lot and I never got a chance to find that hairstylist I love - well, not anymore, Deana is incredible. So personable, fun and passionate about all things hair-related. I'm always hesitant to try new things with my hair, but Deana has never led me wrong and I leave always loving my hair, plus get lots of complements. I would recommend her to anyone, and already have!"
test_2375,This place has always been a great watering hole. The service has always been great.They also have never changed the menu at this place cause its always that good. Try the hot wings and waffle frys.
test_2376,Cool theatre wish they had the real icee though.  Nice spacious theatre I definitely want to come back and try the Imax and JBX.  Also there are daily specials so check before hand for cool discounts.  The popcorn they give you for Tuesday is huge.
test_2377,Love it. Great place to take visiting friends and family. Very fun.
test_2378,"If I could give this horrible place -5 star review I would. So many things gone wrong at this spa. First of all, my friend highly recommended Karla to me because she was ""apparently"" extremely nice, professional and quick. Yeah she was quick alright, didn't care if the customer was hurting from her waxing because she just wanted to get the job done, despite the fact  I told her it was painful. Second of all, I don't know where she got her skill from on waxing eyebrows because my brows have never looked so thin and disgusting. It's the worst shape I've ever gotten since I've been waxing my brows. She didn't even ask what shape I want or how I like it, she just went ahead and did it. Third, when I proceeded to pay for the taxes off of my Groupon, I told her I got the code from my friend because I bought it off of her, she didn't allow me to use it, pretty much implied that I ""stole"" it from someone. So I had to pay the full amount on top of that I already paid my friend the money for Groupon. The worst is not over, my skin is actually reacting from whatever wax she was using, because it's hurting right now. I don't know if it's her technique or the quality of the wax. I will never come back to this place. Now that my friend knows of her treatment of me she will also not go back. Perhaps she just wanted to close her shop right on time so she was rushing my whole appointment which included an upper lip wax, an eyebrow wax and Brazilian. She took less than 15 mins to do all three! Great customer service? I don't think so."
test_2379,"Just visited for the first time last night with my husband. Food is excellent and beautifully presented. They have some unique dishes and periodically offer tasting menus and wine tastings, so you'll definitely find something new and interesting at this place. It's a tiny location, so I'd recommend making a reservation. The servers and owner are great. There was a brief mix up with who our server was, so the owner comped our drinks, which was incredibly nice. Service was top notch, and so was the food. You can order various spreads for your bread - each of which comes in a cute little jar. The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had (and I've tried a lot of brussel sprouts). My husband loved the chips that come with a bacon jam/blue cheese dip and the pampas steak churrasco (I'm a vegetarian, so I passed on these items). We also ordered the boteccine (pasta) with black truffle cream, which was amazing. Overall, an excellent experience. There are so many restaurants along Eastern Ave. in Henderson, so it can be a tough place to survive, but I think this place has a good shot - I certainly hope it does! Can't wait to return!"
test_2380,"Good prices for groceries. When I want the best bang for my buck I hit up this place or Tutti Frutti nearby, but the people here are nicer. Not such a great fresh produce selection but good selection of food oils, as well as cosmetic/shampoo/toiletry/etc. and cleaning products."
test_2381,"This place is fantastic, huge variety of Cambodian food. Very inexpensive. Had the congee, it was perfect. Really nice family run restaurant. Will probably be stopping here every time I'm back in Newmarket."
test_2382,"I myself is taiwanese, so I approve the authenticity of this restaurant. Me and my friend ordered two appetizers, smelly bean curd and Taiwanese tempura. Both of these are well seasoned and tasted very much like the one in Taiwan. I highly recommended both of these. They both are super tasty. 
For Entree I ordered drum pepper chow fun with beef, it was good but it's nothing outstanding. My friend got the squid with Sa cha flavor noodle soup. He likes it a lot, the only suggestion he will say is less vinegar. Maybe offer vinegar on the side for people to add if they want more. 
Another thing I'm going to complain, which is why it goes down to a three star, is that they served us a glass of water where there is obvious lipstick ink shown. We had to return the water. It makes me question how clean do they clean their plates/glasses. However, this place is fairly new so I'm giving them benefit of the doubt, hopefully that was just one time mistake. I hope they can improve on this. I will come back again and update my review.
Other than that, this place can definitely be successful :) yummy authentic Taiwanese food!"
test_2383,"Just an average dog, but costs way too much.
We ordered a plain dog and a corn dog, just the 2 hot dogs were nearly $12.00
No sides, no drinks, nothing in addition.

We had planned to order donuts on the side, but the machine was broken.

The hot dogs were ok, but it's cheaper to buy a corn dog at the CNE.

The place looks just like Poutini's inside. 

Fine if you are drunk, but the food is cheaper and better elsewhere."
test_2384,"So.. after reading one of the reviews below (which I just reposted again for effect) I think i know why my special needs daughter was standing there at school waiting for a Veyo driver to go to her therapy apt for over 2.5 hours! (basically until I got off work and drove there to get her) I even called veyo customer service and begged them to pick her up.  We are not a no show - never have been but in 60 days of service veyo has been a no show more than 7 times today being a complete disaster.  They have also tried to drop her at various locations other than her therapy center.

So today I called and was told a car and then cab #303 was dispatched... FIVE TIMES. Guess the drivers kept cancelling for a reason?Really? this is what you guys do to special needs teens?  I promise I took a photo of the empty parking lot where there were no veyo cars and no green discount cabs and not difficult to see one teen standing there!! 

From the other poster/driver: ""Since voucher calls go to the Veyo system first, and it will continue expanding its search area until it finds one (even if the driver is 20 miles away) the drivers then accept the call, see that it's a small one and then cancel the call....which makes the call disappear like it was never there. The passengers are never made aware and are left scratching their heads wondering why they aren't getting picked up. I've seen passengers wait for over an hour because this keeps happening,  my opinion is, if the passenger has to call in a 2nd time the call should be automatically dispatched to the cab fleet."" 

And no wonder the dispatchers would not tell me what was going on. They just politely told me ""i don't know what happened i will have a car there in 10 minutes"" - obviously they are used to their cars just driving off/calling out.... shame on this entire company"
test_2385,"Executive summary:  a little on the dive bar side but recent renovations have given the interior a causal classy feel.  Good food, options available for vegetarians.  A little tricky for gluten-sensitive folks.  My go to spot for a hookah.  Restrooms aren't the best but are better than they were and are always clean and well stocked.  Decent amount of parking around the building.

This is not the type of place I would normally frequent.  I'd seen this place, up on the hill, as I drove past on the beltline a million times.  So what made me finally come here?  My instructor was belly dancing on the restaurant side one Friday night and I wanted to support her.  Why do I return?  This place feels like home now and I want to support the great people at Hookah, restaurant and bar side.  And for the karaoke!

Belly dancing is featured Friday and Saturday nights in the restaurant side.  They have tables and booths where you can eat dinner while watching the featured dancer.  The menu is a mix of Mediterranean and American dishes, mostly small plates and sharables.  I think the shimp flatbread is my favorite.  My friend raves about the baba ganoush.  Although there are several vegetarian options there's little on the menu for gluten-sensitive folks unless you eat meat without bread, skip the pita served with the hummus and baba ganoush, etc.  But if you're gluten sensitive I'm sure you know all these tricks.  If gluten doesn't bother you the pistachio cake is AMAZING.  

They also have a bar and an area with leather couches on the restaurant side if you prefer to relax and sip a beverage or smoke a hookah.  Drink specials include Old Fashioned on Friday and Bacardi or Captain mixers on Saturday.  The have several delicious specialty martinis as well.

After dinner and the show head on over to the karaoke bar side.  If Billy's behind the bar say ""hi"" from me.  He's always got a smile on his face.  You can't help but smile back.  They are working on updating the karaoke selection but most of the crowd tend toward the tried-and-true favorites anyway.  I've found certain DJs are more friendly and interactive than others but they all do a great job of getting new singers into the rotation.

Smaller tables dot the space, plus plenty of bar stools and even a few leather couches and chairs for relaxing between songs.  Grab a drink, smoke a hookah, and enjoy the singers.

A word of warning in the restroom, the stall doors don't quite lock.  But they've always been clean and well stocked when I've been there.  The one time they were running low on TP I let one of the bartenders know and a new roll arrived pronto!

Parking is decent, located around the building.  The restaurant is located in the middle of a trailer park so as you're driving up the hill past all the trailers, yes, you're headed the right direction.  It's an odd location but come inside, sit back, enjoy a hookah, and relax."
test_2386,"Ate here on a whim since it's right on the corner.  They had an outdoor table right away.  The menu was big, lots of choices, including many vegetarian, local, and organic.  The food was fresh with good serving sizes.  I had the avocado brie sandwich and my husband had the vegetarian Singapore noodles.  Both dishes were great.  They serve Mill St. beers and the prices for everything (food and drinks) were exceptional.

The only odd thing was that we didn't have one server.  It was unusual but all of the waitresses helped us and someone was always available when we needed them."
test_2387,"This place was awesome! Isabella was a phenomenal guide for our party of four and lead us through a 5 course tasting menu of amazing and diverse flavors, textures, and experiences. This is a 5 star place; it's pricy, so know that going into it, but extraordinary nonetheless!"
test_2388,"So I have been wanting to try this place for months and unfortunately I was a bit underwhelmed.  The pizza was alright, but I don't know if i would crave it again."
test_2389,"I went to see Megan on Wednesday for a micro-needling treatment. The summer special they are having made it super cheap, but she could easily charge more. Megan was gentle and thorough. I'm loving the results and will definitely be going back."
test_2390,"I heard great things about this particular buffet but it just reminded me of a higher quality old country buffet. the food was unoriginal and there weren't that many options. and the maki rolls...sigh. 

The line is unnecessary long and i would recommend visiting another buffet. the wait is not worth it."
test_2391,"Wow, way overrated.  The service stank, on an empty Monday night at 8pm even though I made a reservation in advance!  I waited 15 minutes for water and a drink order and it took another 15 to get a drink and order.  I started with Queso Fundido.  It took 20 minutes to arrive and was, despite the description, basically a blob of panela cheese (rubbery farmer cheese) that was thrown in a ramekin and waved under the broiler.   There was no browning of the cheese and it was ice cold in the middle, with the consistency of a tennis ball.  It was topped with a few stringy grilled onions and peppers.  Real Queso Fundido should be oozy goodness, molten and delicious with onions in it, not on it.  Leave to the two Hollywood Gueras to screw up such a basic and simple appetizer.

The main dish was ""Yucatan Pork"" - pulled pork in banana leaf. It was dry dry dry.  No taste, no oily carnitas goodness.  Blah.

No flan on the menu for dessert.

For the $50 I dropped there, I'd have had an equally authentic and quality meal at Taco Bell for one tenth the price.  The Hard Rock Hotel's ""Pink Taco"" is a much better bet.  So far for me, virtually all the star power top chef eateries in LV have sucked.  What happens in Vegas should be left behind in Vegas."
test_2392,"Nicole just flat out knows her stuff - what works and what doesn't, when it comes to cleaning carpet and flooring. I continue to be amazed by how much she knows and what kind of results she is able to achieve. If your floors need help, call Nicole with Artistry Carpet Cleaning!"
test_2393,"Not sure how we found out about this place, but I am definitely glad that we did! It was absolutely amazing and worth the trek. 

For $10, you get 1/2 portuguese bbq chicken, a salad, rice, a mountain of french fries and a dinner roll. Definitely enough food for two hungry tummies! 

We're not the spicy food type, so when she asked if we wanted it spicy we were quick to say no! I kid you not, she gave us a look as if we were weenies :[ so we hesitantly changed our minds and asked for it spicy. Let me tell you that sauce is phenomenal, it would not have been the same without it! Its vinegary and sweet with just enough kick. By the end of the meal, we were soaking up the spicy sauce with our fries just to make sure we didn't waste a drop of it. The fries are delicious on their own. just the right seasoning.

Such a great deal for a great amount of delicious chicken and fries heaven! I wish they had a place like this in LA. 

I must warn you though, its a small corner establishment. Not much room to sit and eat. So do figure out other places you can park it and enjoy your meal!"
test_2394,"We came here on a Monday night and ordered off of their late night specials. We ordered 
1. All-nighter breakfast, 1.99
2. classic burger and fries, 2.99
for 6.38

- This is a great place for your midnight munchies. Compared to the Grand Cafe's in other Station Casinos. This spot is clean and rarely filled with drunks. 
- The Grand Cafe is a better alternative than Denny's. It's cheaper. As long as you have a boarding pass, you are in the clear. 
- The only reason why it's not a 5 star is because I prefer going to Coronado Cafe at South Point. Although this place has steak and eggs for 5.95, they got the same thing but for 3.95! haha. 
- Service is simple. We got our food quickly. Jonathan was a pleasant dude. 
- All-night breakfast was simple. Quick late night craving satisfied. 
- Classic burger and fries were also simple. No frills. If you are craving a hamburger, I'd say it's a better alternative than the Jack in the Box that is off of Gibson. 
- Overall, amazing place to dine when the cravings hit and you have time to sit and relax."
test_2395,"Eclectic family style breakfast dinner experience. i enjoyed the proportions and duh the food was indeed like family. They even offer homemade jam with the toast.... another yum... now I did want some of the homemade dutch apple pie,but it was already gone.... Hello people its 10:30 am.... they coulda saved me some..... guess I will just have to come back...."
test_2396,"Sorry to say - it's awful!  Not fresh, it's frozen and reheated food. Left with a nauseous feeling from rubbery chicken. Too many great Mexi places to spend $60 on AWFUL food. No go!"
test_2397,"Maria did microblading on my eyebrows and they turned out awesome. She is very meticulous and takes pride in her work. She explains everything to you. The procedure was done comfortably and all tools are very very clean! She uses the best numbing creams and the procedure is virtually painless, especially if you follow instructions to the letter. I appreciate her service 100%."
test_2398,"Great food, great atmosphere, & friendly service.  We sat right next to the open kitchen - cool to see the chef's working."
test_2399,"My Mom and I tried ""2 Gals"" for the first time a couple days ago.  Mom had the San Diego wrap (slightly modified), and I had the ABC burger (slightly modified as well).   #highmaintenace :)

Food was exactly as ordered.  Our server, Melissa, was extremely attentive and anticipated our needs...a true sign of an exceptional server.  I was inquiring of some methodology on the preparation of the foods, etc., and before I knew it, the owner (Balinda) was answering all of our questions...not giving any sign of frustration with all of our questions...very impressed!  She even sent us home with complimentary Tomato Bisque soup as Mom has some restrictions and that's one of her favorites!

We are SO HAPPY to find an EXCELLENT restaurant in Concord, and plan to return soon (and tell all of our friends!)

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!

test_2400,"Nice, I almost forgot to drop props for the happy family that is Opa. I've been eating here a lot more now, that I live closer to the restaurant on Sahara and Rainbow, right across from Buffet @ Asia. I always hanker for the simpler stuff, like the meatballs or the chicken....and it's hearty enough and different enough to warrant repeat visits. From the look of it I'm not the only one who appreciates the consistency and good nature of the people....the dancing and traditional song routines at night are pretty trippy too. The feeling I walked away with was being invited to a family gathering with a bill included.
Nonetheless, points for uniqueness in our town of cookie-cutter ""culture."""
test_2401,"I love this place, the service was fantastic and so was the food. Joshua recommended a desert that was super delicious. I will definitely come back. Thank you, Estefan for the delicious cocktail"
test_2402,"The show was visually stunning! There was so much going on at any moment of the show, it was hard to catch everything, but my eyes loved it.
The colors were brilliant and everything was perfectly coordinated by the actors.
There is definitely not a lot of acrobatics in which you would assume in a Cirque show. Still, it was gorgeous!"
test_2403,"Fresh ingredients!  Very reasonably priced.  We had Kung Pao Beef, Chicken with Cashew and Cantonese Pan Fried Noodle.  Everything was very tasty.  As with any Chinese restaurant;  if you want more spicy with your dish, ask for hot chili sauce.  Staff was attentive and friendly.

test_2404,"It was okay. The people were really nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I went together, and I decided just to get rice and naan because I wasn't very hungry, but my boyfriend was quite hungry so he got a dinner. He got the ""tikka"" kabob plate. Each dinner plate comes with naan, salad, and rice. 

My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).

The actual venue was extremely busy; we went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. There was a lot of tables in the restaurant but they were all full. A varied mix of people; families with children, groups of friends, couples... everyone. We decided to get takeout because really hectic restaurants are uncomfortable to me.

I would not go out of my way again for a meal here, but if I happen to be in the area and I am hungry, I would probably go for some naan or something. The people were very  nice, and I like to support nice people! :)"
test_2405,"Interesting to read through all these reviews and see them all over the place. I loved this venue for watching the Steelers do their thing, and I am certainly NOT going to review the team here, just the stadium. There's an awesome view from almost every seat, even the ""cheap seats,"" which unfortunately aren't so cheap.

Concessions were actually faster and better than most pro sports places I've been previously, and the prices were also pretty much the same (high) - one of my gripes with pro sports in general is that it costs an average family of 4 a fortune to enjoy a pro game in any major pro sport, so this isn't really a surprise. I think my beer was $8 for a 24 oz cup of Yuengling. Hot dogs could be done with a little more pizzazz. Franktuary and Station Street guys, are you reading this? Why not try and strike up a conversation with the Heinz Field folks like other Pittsburgh ""favorites"" so we can enjoy some variety here?

I liked walking around and watching the tailgaters, and stopped in to a nearby steakhouse to have a few beers with friends before the game - it's a nice, convenient sports area, anchored by this great open-air stadium. One of my big questions is: why are there so few events there? Tax base? I would think a stadium like this could host an amazing plethora of rock concerts all Summer long!!!

Either way, I loved my experience here, and will definitely be back."
test_2406,"Went here for dinner a few nights ago.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  This place is most definitely more a bar than a restaurant and probably gets packed at night.  Kelly's seems like a nice spot to relax and have a few drinks.  The decor is interesting with lots of comfy looking couches on which to socialize.  Anyway, to the food...   

To start we ordered a round of drinks.  The happy hour specials are pretty decent but the $8 martini ($16 regular price) had an extremely weak pour.  Barely even worth the 8 bucks.  The wings were just ok but the mac n' cheese was pretty tasteless.

For an entree I ordered the burger which was very good.  Perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  I wasn't sure what to think of the side condiments that came with though (some kind of peppers and another mushy spread thing).  The fries were also very good and seemed to be freshly made and not frozen.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her chicken breast sandwich.  I had a bite as well and it was very good.  The aioli makes it I think.

Our waiter/server was very good.  He was courteous, friendly, and didn't take too long with my diet coke refills.

In summary, this place is a bar with above-average bar food.  I probably won't be back, but not because it wasn't good.  It was good but just not that special.

Pro Tip:  get the half price certificate at Local Dines ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) because it is definitely worth it."
test_2407,"I received such amazing service from this Kal Tire location! I got a razor blade in my tire and took my vehicle there to buy a new tire and switch out my spare. I did not have an appointment and it was clear there was many vehicles to be taken care of before mine. They did not hesitate to come out and check everything out and offer a quick switch! I had my newborn daughter with me and we were heading to BC. They made sure everything was good for our road trip! It was exceptional service and I will be going to this location for any future services as I've never really used a kal tire before.

Thank you so much for the great service and for ensuring my daughter and I left your parking lot safely! So much appreciation!!! Keep up the exceptional customer service!!!!"
test_2408,"Starving on the way home and Bojangles is the only option coming from uptown. It was 10:26 and tried to order something. ""We're out of chicken."" Um, what? Whether you didn't want to make more or you aren't capable of ordering food it doesn't really matter. Unacceptable. The last time I was there I was waiting for my food for over 20 minutes and swore I'd never go back. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment."
test_2409,"Central location on the strip and during conferences, incredibly competent staff, and every room is a suite. I don't want a boutique hotel caught up in it's boutiquey-ness. I want a hotel that really wants to cater to my comfort, and makes me feel like they just want what's best for me. Forgive me, I had to take off a star because they charge for their gym."
test_2410,"Polar Air has provided me with probably the WORST A/C service I've ever had.  I've had the tech out to look at my A/C unit several times.  The first service call was because the air wasn't blowing at all, and that only some vents seemed to have airflow through them.  The tech told me that he needed to order a new part.  Fast forward 2 weeks and between their customer service department telling me they ordered the wrong part, and the tech telling me that the part was installed already (after the service department admitted that they don't actually have the correct part yet) and this has just been a fiasco.  I've resorted to taping strips of tissue to my vents to show the tech the lack of airflow.  Still, after all of this, my A/C is lukewarm.  I not only recommend against Polar Air in the Las Vegas area, but I will tell any and everyone who asks to literally go to any one else.  Joey the HVAC tech is especially one to avoid."
test_2411,"The driver was very nice and the lady that was working at the booth was so very friendly. We use to park at preflight, but with the the construction we decided to park here and we really like it so we will be staying here."
test_2412,"I am not one to write negative reviews, however, I feel this needs to be said. I have been a customer for a long time and it was a great place to go until the past few weeks. I have noticed how terrible the management is. Beth was the manager before and this place really lost its shine when she left. I was frequently receiving Hennas from several of the girls and all of them are great besides the new manager. I have watched her talk down to her employees on several occasions, its amazing what happens when a shop hires a teenager for their management! One of the girls that I used to see frequently when I visited the shop, Kaitlin, was amazing. She did beautiful work, always very helpful while I was shopped and always greeted me with a warm and friendly smile. I was informed she is no longer there. I have watched this place decline over the past few weeks. I did recently visit the Henna Shoppe again last week and Delaney assisted me. She is very talented as well, very pleasant and always greets everyone with a smile. During my visit I did notice the manager treating some of the staff rudely again. This is such a shame and I do not plan to return to the store due to what I have witnessed. This place has lost quite a bit of talent over the past several months and possibly more if this behavior continues. I am not sure if the owner reads these reviews but someone needs to and step in. These girls are amazing and talented artists and it's truly a shame at what it has turned in to. I have mentioned this to several of my friends and family as well. I wish all the current artists the best of luck."
test_2413,"Wife and I had a Groupon for this place so decided why not :). Once inside all we really wanted to do was order to go. There were slices of pizza in a window that you could order but we wanted to order a whole pizza to go. When we asked they told us we needed to be seated in order to order a whole pizza...I was like seriously?!

So we sat down even though we did not want to and ordered a half and half pizza. One side margarheta and one side hawaiian. It was thin and cooked well. The taste was good. I prefer a crispier bottom crust than the one they gave us.

Overall, the pizza was good but the service was odd..."
test_2414,"I wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...

We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area).  The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking.  The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations.

The next day, we became violently ill.  With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this.  My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  Such a shame!!"
test_2415,This Blimpie location is the best I've experienced. For the past 17 years I have grown to love this place. The other locations I've checked out have been overshadowed by the service and quality of this one. I will continue to make quick lunch trips from time to time. The same lunch staff seems like they have been here forever. Truly a staple at Tatum and Shea!
test_2416,"I put them zero, suffered an attack by security guards men to clarify that beat me last Saturday July 16, 2016, I have a couple of video but I wonder if someone who was there and saw him aside could contact me or someone had problems with security there, eh been humiliated and severely beaten when all I did was love me amuse in las vegas, please people if somebody have more info or pass something similar write here. 

thanks"
test_2417,"If you have not yet visited, then make it a point to do so.  It is a must for brunch on a Sunday or Saturday.  Portions are huge and delicious !  Incredibly family friendly. Casandra was our server and she was as sweet as the food was delicious. Chef and Owner Matt comes out and greets everybody in due course. He actually wants to know your thoughts about the food and service.  
We had the longonisa and potato's as a starter. We destroyed it. My miso pork belly burger was sooo big I couldn't finish it. The burger was 12 oz and there had to have been 6 oz of beautiful pork belly sitting atop it.  The white rice was not really good. The garlic taste was owed powering. Didn't care because I knew I wouldn't finish the burger anyway. Everyone that dined there thought it was terrific. Make sure you try anyone of their burgers. Huge hits out of the park."
test_2418,The food and drinks where great. This place was full of specials from 55 cents wings to happy hour drink specials! The waiter was friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again.
test_2419,Clean store; very good prices! But i have to complain about cashier non stop talking to customer in front of me; they were to blame too but cashier please keep scanning while talking not scan one item then stop to chat! I only had minimal items; by this time all lines were full.. i had to be elsewhere and nearly just left. Yes i gave myself plenty of time to get through; people on their break need quick service. Nice you knew each other but when lines are so long and all cash registers open; zip it and move. The lady behind me was also irritated...
test_2420,"This is the second time I've used Rick and Carpet Monkey.  The first time they came by to clean an 8 year old cream colored sued couch we have.  It was getting pretty dingy as you can imagine and he restored to to practically brand new, very impressed.  

So we had him come by again today to take care of the carpets at a property we just moved out of.  The carpets were a white color, so foot traffic and having a dog, really caused a lot of dirt build up after a year and 4 months at this home.  We were pretty concerned that the carpets were going to stay pretty dirty even with a good shampooing, when we moved in the carpets had been ""shampooed"" by another company and let's just say they were still disgusting.

Well Rick/Carpet Monkey did an amazing job today and they came out amazing.  I remember he said to me that he was pretty leery about this job before he did it, as to how bad the carpets looked.  Well we will be calling him again when we need him and referring him to all of our friends.

Not only is he professional but also very friendly - at this point I see no need to go through any other option for carpet/furniture cleaning in Las Vegas.  Do your self a favor and stick with this locally owned and operated business that's going to give you your money's worth."
test_2421,"We've been putting off coming here because my wife doesn't care much for seafood. I on the otherhand, love it. One weeknight we had just exercised at the nearby LA Fitness and wanted to try someplace different for dinner. It was a weeknight and we thought it wouldn't be too busy. We were not sorry for our decision.  
The first thing I should mention was that we went on an unusually warm spring evening. Their patio was open and I have to say that you need to check this place out. We were surrounded by sand and waterfalls.  There were several firepits and couch style seating. They really make you feel as though you're on vacation.  
I should mention that the service was very good. The food was also wonderful with enough selections from both the land and the sea to keep us both happy. The only downside was the the prices are a bit high, but the quality and atmosphere are worth it for special occasions,  like when the sun goes down."
test_2422,"I'm not from Scottsdale, but let me tell you - this place was like MAGIC.  If you're a Philly fan, this is your spot.  Phils/Eagles fans are a little crazy, and they were both playing side-by-side on the big screens tonight.  You can imagine what the atmosphere was like in the bar.

Nothing fancy about the inside - lots of flat screens and projector screens so you can watch the game(s).  There are kind of 3 areas - table seating (and a few couches), the actual bar, and the upstairs.  Not a whole lot of people were sitting in the ""upper deck"", but there was some raffle stuff going on and they were playing some random games up there.

If this review were based on the food alone, it wouldn't get 4 stars.  I had the beef sliders - fries were dry, sliders were greasy, but c'mon.  This is a sports bar.  You go to drink beer, eat some whatever food, and have a good time.  I didn't get the sense of any of the servers being rude or whatever like some of the other reviews - the bartender was actually really chill.

Bottom line, wear your Phils/Eagles gear (almost everyone wearing vintage stuff from Philavania.com), grab a beer, and enjoy your time at this bar that brings a bit of the city of brotherly love to the desert.

Oh yeah, check to make sure the Phillies or Eagles are playing before you go haha."
test_2423,"Kina has been doing my brows for a few years now - as a lady with some full brows, I have had a difficult time finding someone who knows how to shape brows and has them looking alike! She is incredibly kind and has an excellent attention to detail - there is never one hair out of place. As a bonus - even though she's always busy, I'm always able to find an appointment, which has been a nightmare at other places. Highly recommend!"
test_2424,"Love their waffle ! Great crowd, but be prepared to wait for few minutes before you get the seat especially  on weekends."
test_2425,"I am an Adams customer due to a friend who'd been using them for years.  My service with  them started in 2002 and I have been nothing but satisfied with not only the skill and ""manners"" of the team, but also their willingness to ""get me in the schedule"" when there is an emergency. I have recommended the company to most of my friends and all of my family, we are all very pleased with the service and knowledge of each and every crew member we've been sent. We have air conditioning, heater and evaporative cooler all purchased from and cared for by Adams.  The few times I've asked them to go above and beyond, they've been right there for me.  Thanks !"
test_2426,I love Q Karaoke so I decided to eat at QBistro for the first time! I loved it. When you walk in they have a really nice seating area with booths and one side with half booths half tables. They have Kpop music videos playing and pretty decor in here. The food on the menu is sooooo good. They have a variety of everything. We ordered the bulgogi pizza an order of baked mussels and mozzarella sticks. The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10! I ordered the frozen strawberry daiquiri with apple reds and my boy ordered the mango with mikes hard lemonade! So good! I will definitely have to come back and try more!
test_2427,This they do try to upsale that too very hard and if u refeuse it they will make annying faces. I opted for this because this was cheapest. the guy offered to upgrade the car which we refused to which he said that u will have t wait for ur car.. We waited for 15-20 minutes and they say additional 45 minutes.. But then they gave me the car in another 5 minuted because i really got angry. Making false promises. I got insurance from priceline to which they said this is not good enough and sold me their insurance for 17 bucks. Its ok for the price. But wait time is more.. Returning the car was very quick.
test_2428,Booked through golf now and paid online in full.  When I arrived I was charged a$4.99 cart gps fee.  I called golf now who have the price advertised as with cart.  I believe this is not an honest practice to have a non disclosed mandatory fee after full payment to Golf now.
test_2429,"The reviews weren't that great but the food was good and they accomidated my kids and I.  It was such a lovely night in PHX.  They even had a nice man playing guitar outside of the patio and my kids really enjoyed him.  I eneded up order the turkey Panini it did't look a panini at all just a turkey sub with some toasted bread, I would have like it if it were grilled better.  But my kids enjoyed thier food and the night so it was win for all!"
test_2430,Great service. Came in for a new battery and got in and out I'm 20minutes. They even charged up my phone till it turned on. Life savers. Not bad pricing.
test_2431,"The only saving grace of this place is the lettuce wraps offered and the price of tacos on Tuesday. Other than that, be prepared for some pretty miserable service and experiences. The food isn't bad - there is at the very least a decent selection and the tacos are pretty consistent. 

I've probably been here at least six Tuesdays and almost always regret my decision within 2 minutes of being in the door. 

First off, management - I'd like to directly address you on your hiring choices. Every hostess I've ever spoken to here literally seems shocked that I would ask for my name to be put on the list for a table. I'm sorry, but when they applied to be a hostess wasn't that kind of the expectation? The shock isn't even what annoys me most though, it's the blatant rudeness. I don't think I've ever been treated with less human decency in my life. It's a pattern and I wouldn't leave this review if it wasn't. 

Bartenders are hit and miss. Some have gone above and beyond (by some I mean only one), but the rest have been so rude it's unbelievable. I understand that you're busy - I'm not concerned about waiting when people are slammed. My concern is literally at times being told to order my food with other bartenders because they're too busy, in a very disrespectful fashion. When a patron is being polite and patient this just poorly reflects on the establishment. Particularly when your watered down sugary house margaritas mix is giving me a headache. 

I personally feel that the owners should be embarrassed by the level of service here. Avoid at all costs."
test_2432,"Service was good. The tortilla shells were amazing! Funny how we were still talking about the tortillas the next day. Too bad what was on top of one of the best tortillas we've ever had wasn't amazing.

The problem was that the tacos that we had - lamb, rib eye,  fish, shrimp. They lacked a certain finesse and most importantly,  texture.

-the lamb was perfectly lamby. Very down homey and barrio style. I'm fine with the fact that there wasn't anything else on the tortilla but the braised lamb. 

-the rib eye was greasy. Like oily. The flavours were good. No contrasting textures with whatever else was on there.

-the fish was not the best. It was limp, and boring. At $7 that's too pricey for such a blah taco. La Carnita, Grand Electric and even El Asador have way better fish tacos for under $5.

-the shrimp taco was a hot mess. Says in the menu that it's spicy.  It's not. Had all sorts or pineapple on it. Too much. Was too sweet. We overheard our neighbours on the patio say the same thing.

We also had some sort of tuna app. No texture as well. Tuna mixed with some sort of orange mayonnaise without flavour, topped with a whipped guac and some shredded iceberg lettuce on top. Poor tuna. It deserves better than that. Couldn't taste the fish. Mush on top of mush.

Service was was good. Good thing I tip for service and not food."
test_2433,"OMG a pizza I looked for all my life...as perfect as you can find.  Chewy thin slightly chard crust that is sturdy enough to hold the toppings, tomato sauce that tasted homemade and delicious, just enough cheese to satisfy ( not a chewy cheese like bubble gum pulling to the ceiling) and finally a pinch or two of fresh cut basil. I added pepperoni to the second Margherita pizza and was in heaven. You gotta go  find this truck.  No kidding..I am HOOKED."
test_2434,Got the breakfast sandwich with home fries both of which were great. Only reason I didn't give 4 stars is slow service as the place was busy and the ice coffee was just ok slightly watery
test_2435,"NEVER EVER EVER FLY THIS AIRLINE. It's not worth it, doesn't matter how cheap it is. I am beyond upset with them. They delayed my flight 6 hours and refused to give me a refund, not only that but was told my flight was delayed"
test_2436,"One of my favorite happy hour places in the city. 
The menu offers a variety of cocktails, wine and appetizers at $6 each. 
The appetizer portions are large enough to share. 

Highly recommend the sweet chile calamari- lightly breaded, lightly drizzled with a sweet chile sauce and red peppers and spicy yellow peppers. 

The house made burratta is light and creamy - served with crostini and roasted grape tomatoes 

The roasted mushroom and artichoke flatbread was tender and crispy garnished with some light greens."
test_2437,"This place is a complete money grabbing setup. Avoid at all cost. I've never had a worst dental experience. They did not provide the services I schedule and instead spent 20 minutes trying to sell me a bunch of unneeded elective services. Instead of cleaning my teeth like scheduled I was told about all the work I needed, even though every dentist I've visited in my life disagree. When I refused to schedule any of the added on follow up work, and wanted my x-rays, they became even ruder."
test_2438,"The latest Toronto popup to go brick-and-mortar style is Toronto Underground Market fav Rock Lobster Food Company. They settled in this past weekend and opened their doors for the first time Saturday night. We visited Sunday right at opening and were greeted by friendly staff eager to follow up opening night. 

Atmosphere

The decor was nice, tied in well with the seafood style with wood trimming abound. The couch adjacent to the wall was quite comfortable and it appeared as though the entire restaurant could seat about 60 with some extra room leftover. Greeting you as you come in to be seated is a mouth-watering raw bar. Further down is the more traditional bar which includes a neat feature that I haven't seen in Toronto, wine-on-tap. This feature was not quite ready for launch, but owner Matt told us that he will have it operational soon and that he is the first one to bring this to the city. There are a couple VQA wines available for $1/oz, which is not bad. The music is a crossover between classic rock & hip hop at a decent volume. Brittney Spears was played at one point, to which Matt quickly got rid of and apologized. Rogue employee playlist or something more sinister? 

Drinks

We started out with the Rock Lobster Caesars, RLF's take on Caesars with a nice big beer mug and a lobster tail shoved in because why not! They were delicious with a solid kick, and the lobster tail was a nice contrast for the drink. Post meal we tried a couple of cocktails off the menu: Queen Pickle and White Rabbit. The  latter was far superior, a nice sour mix with delicious Tromba Tequila to stand on.

Eats

To start out we ordered two oysters each, one of each kind they had. Unfortunately their supply had been wrecked from opening night so they were down to one kind. Very fresh and delicious. We also had the Lobster Cappuccino which is the RLF take on lobster bisque and oh-boy did they nail it. Incredible bisque with nice chunks of lobster, chives and topped with Cr√®me fraiche. Matt described his process in creating this dish and how he wanted to really nail it as a fresh take on bisque and he delivered. Our third and final appetizer was the jerk crab & shrimp. Be prepared to get messy eating this, you will be fully covered in oils and spices when finished. Trust me when I say it is totally worth it. The jerk spices were done the right way and didn't overpower the crustaceans at all. As all of the seafood we sampled tonight, it was fresh and delicious. Lastly, the mains came in. Lobster rolls, and the legendary RLF rolls are on the money. I don't believe I've had a better lobster roll anywhere and I've had a few.

Verdict

Matt owner/chef came by our table a couple of times. You can tell he has a passion for his work and his cooking and it really comes across both in person and in the food. We told him that we hadn't had seafood this good since a trip to Boston years ago. Service was on point all night (even the bartender came out to check up on us), everyone was super friendly and enthusiastic. The web site definitely needs some work, namely menus and pictures of the new joint, but honestly that is how far I had to reach to come up with a complaint about this place. I am eager to see if they will maintain their high standard and will definitely be back soon to try out some more items. Lobster Poutine anyone?"
test_2439,"Took a few friends here for dinner on a Sunday at 6pm. Not very busy. I've eaten here before but haven't returned in over a year or more as the service was somewhat slow and disorganized the last time.  This time, service was much better. We ordered wine, placed our order and the food began to arrive in a good succession after 15-20 minutes. 

The food selection is upscale Cantonese and is amazing!  I love that they add/change  menu items to keep it fresh but still keep their regular items. Every dish was well seasoned, not overly salty ( my big pet peeve) and very fresh. See pics for what we had. You won't find any Chinese Cdn dishes and they crank up the standard Cantonese fare a few notches. This place is great for creativity in their dishes and not unreasonably priced. You get what you pay for so dishes range from $12-25. They offer a wide range of preparation (pan fry, steamed, grilled, saut√©ed) for your lobster/crab/ fish etc in a variety of sauces and styles too. 

As for ambience, it's better than most Chinese restaurants in town but can get very loud. One side of the resto is for family dining and one side is more of a Hong Kong Cafe. They also offer dimsum but I've only eaten dinner here.

If you're seeking a new Chinese experience, a few items may be unfamiliar or possibly frightening so go with a friend if it's your first time who knows about things like pig intestines, sea cucumbers, enoki mushrooms and tofu concoctions. Don't worry, they still offer beef chow mein and spring rolls but this is not the right place for those items. Go here if you want to extend your Chinese palate!!!"
test_2440,Great service and delicious food. My friends and I came in for brunch and let me say I love this place. Everything was flavorful and came out quickly. Plus $10 for almost bottomless mimosas is such a deal.
test_2441,The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 stars is because the ribs without the sauce are really really good and so was the corn.  He advised us that the brisket would be really good but I found it dry and unappealing.  I like my brisket moist and fatty not lean and dry.  Also they say they close at 9 but the waitress started sweeping and cleaning around us while we were eating and saying they were closing in 15 mins. If your going to close at 830 say you close at 830 don't advertise that you close at 9
test_2442,Lots of fun great fun good wine and food........my only objection is that the music is too loud in all locations as I have been to all  if your in the back you can hardly hear the teachers but im always happy to paint and the teachers are so fun  always meet nice people   if it is your B DAY  your treated with a surprise
test_2443,Always a pleasure to dine at Peppermill... The atmosphere as well as the great food! The waitresses are always friendly... The food is is cooked to perfection and large portions.... Have enjoyed Peppermill since it opened.. Every time we go to Vegas it's a 'must' for at least one meal
test_2444,"The menu has very little English on it, and apparently it is incorrectly translated in places. Spent $45 for two meals and two cans of soda - and wasn't completely full when I left. Considering all of the options in this area, I won't go again. Tasty, but not worth the cost."
test_2445,"Tortilla soup was super spicy and delicious ! Chrissy at the bar was super attentive, friendly and helpful !! Food and service was amazing"
test_2446,Fancy place. Amazing food made right in front of your eyes. We had a blast and enjoyed the food.
test_2447,"This is a great place to go for any occasion. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is fun and relaxing. I've been a few times and each time I try something new, haven't been disappointed yet."
test_2448,"This is my first time eating at this place but it was a great experience! First off, the ones running the store (they're a couple I believe) are super nice. The lady is so sweet and really cares about what my group and I wanted and answered all of our questions with a smile. This couple sitting next to my table complained about something so stupid and demanded a discount which the lady gave them it. They were so rude to her but she handled it well. 

The fish was good and tasted really fresh. The salmon was my favorite. I usually don't eat sashimi as it's pricey sometimes, but the quality and price for what you eat is amazing. Lunch is $13.99 which is so good!! AND it's AYCE! I read some other reviews saying that the handrolls were falling apart but that did not happen to my table. 

For desert I got the mango and green tea ice cream. They weren't the fake tasting flavors that are bad, it tasted like it was made with real mango and the green tea one was great. I love green tea and some places just have really fake green tea flavors. My friend got the red bean one and it had actual pieces or red bean which was nice and she really liked it. They were also really light so after eating a lot of sushi that was the perfect desert. I don't often drink alcohol but since my friends were drinking I decided to get one as well and it was very tasty!

The sushi place is a little hole in the wall and the interior is cute! There are private booths on both sides of the restaurant which give a really nice vibe. You can really get lost in conversations and lose track of time.
 
I just recommend redoing some signs since they look a little worn. Also I think they should try promoting their drinks more cause we had to ask them if they had anything which they have quite a few options of. 

Just give this place a try! With friendly service and good affordable food with a nice environment, what's there to lose?"
test_2449,Kayla is my GO to nail girl! This place is awesome and friendly! Make sure you book a appointment ahead of time because they are busy! They offer many services and are up to date on current nail trends including chromatic! Every time I come here I leave so happy ! Ask for Kayla !!!!
test_2450,"Nous sommes de Boucherville.  Avons d√©couvert ce restaurant que tout r√©cemment.  La pizza est extraordinaire.  Cuite dans au four avec un choix incomparable.  Cet endroit est maintenant LA PLACE par excellence pour une bonne pizza.  Pour ceux et celles qui aiment manger √©pic√©, ajoutez-y leur huile piquante."
test_2451,"Best gyro in Pittsburgh. The night time crowd is a bit tense so it's better to go during the day or for dinner. Gyro, fries and ice tea."
test_2452,"I visited Tea Fusion Cafe for the first time last week and went again today.  Last week, I had Mega Mango Tea Mason Jar Refresher and a Grilled Pork Banh Mi.  It was awesome!  We ordered calamari for the table and it also delicious.   We told our coworkers how good it was and they wanted to go with us.  So, today we went back.  Today, I had the Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi and Strawberry Kiss Tea Mason Jar Refresher.  The chicken was a tad too salty, but the overall flavor was good.  The strawberry tea was good, but not as good as the mango.  For people who don't like overly sweet drinks, strawberry is for you.  We ordered calamari and popcorn chicken for the table.  Calamari was better hands down.  I'll definitely visit again and try something new.  But, I'm thinking that the grilled pork and mango tea from my first visit will be hard to top. Also, the staff is very nice and helpful if you questions about any of the food or drinks."
test_2453,Ruth and Milena arrived early and worked hard.  They both did an excellent job cleaning our house. We will be starting a recurring service.  They went above and beyond what I expected.
test_2454,"If you need to anywhere in a timely manner, avoid AAA yellow cab at all costs! I called for a cab to take me to the airport this morning, and was told that it would take 5 to 15 minutes for my cab to arrive. Perfect because i had plenty of time. After 10 minutes I took all of my bags out to the curb, and proceeded to wait for another 30 minutes. Because my 15 minutes cab wait took 40 minutes i ended up missing my flight.

I called AA yellow cab asking them for a complimentary ride back home from the airport, and they refused. I was told that they recommend 2 hours for airport pickup, which I was not told when I made the call for pickup. If I had any idea that it could potentially take that long, I would have arranged for other transportation.  The agent was also unable to put me in contact with a supervisor. I was told I would get a phone call three days later after a ""full investigavtion"" had been done. This sounds to me like customer service code for ""you'll never hear from us again."" 

There are cab companies in Phoenix that you can rely on. AAA Yellow cab isdefinitely NOT one of them."
test_2455,"Very bad service.. checked in on line so that I didn't have to wait in the lobby , since that's what check in on line is. Still waited for over an hour after my set check in time. Very unfriendly service. When I asked how much longer I have to wait they called me I. And put me in examining room and left me waiting longer."
test_2456,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!!
It took me this long to write up a review for Nothing Bundt Cakes, they are truly AMAZING!!!!
 I prefer this over a cake anytime for my birthday, and everyone who knows me knows this is very true!!! 
I have been in love with nothing bundt cakes for over two years now!!! 
Best bundt cakes ever, they are super moist and tasty!!! Heaven in your mouth, it's an explosion of fluffy cake, with sweet, sweet flavors, my top faves are their Red Velvet, Marble, THE ALMOND POPPYSEED, and ect... I LOVE THEM ALL!!!!!

   The customer service here is always great!!! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fast, simple and easy breezy!!! :) 
YOU MUST TRY if you haven't, I can assure you, that you will never regret it!! 
(Except if you eat too much and gain a few pounds) Then you might!!! JK :)"
test_2457,"I'm big on customer service and as soon as you walk in you feel right at home. The workers are very friendly and offered a free sample of guava cake that made me a little giddy to say the least (that's an understatement - it made me a lot giddy). It was delicious and I would definitely recommend the cake for a birthday. The workers are also locals from Hawaii who came here and decided to start a business with the most common pastry commodities in Oahu and bring it to Las Vegas. 

A friend and I also tried a sample of the poi malasadas - not bad, but my favorite has to the be custard-filled ones. They were AWESOME!! The malasadas were not too greasy as many of them tend to be. The plain ones are pretty good too. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it so much, I finished most of the ones I bought that day :/ Oh well, it was that darn good!

The place is new and you can tell as they don't have very much in the store yet such as chairs and very little displayed in the refrigerator. But you are pretty much in and out of that place so, nevertheless, I would recommend those that love Hawaiian pastries to try this place."
test_2458,"Heaven. Just what I wanted on a chilly night in Montreal.

We had the small meal, which came with a stellar spinach and mushroom soup topped with fried onions, followed by the raclette of course. 

The raclette was delicious, as always, with excellent accompaniments, including 3 kinds of cured meats, potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, peppers, and cauliflower. And the standout unique touch--thin slices of apples that seemed to have been soaked in cider. They were so delicious.

The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and the space was warm and quiet, making for a bit of a romantic setting on a cold night with lightly falling snow. 

It is BYOB so we were able to bring a split of a really delicious wine that reminded us that we really need to pay more attention to wine quality on a daily basis. 

No complaints, I'd go back tonight if I were still there."
test_2459,"I go for the soynomi and the fries thats about it.  My friend is a vegan and she tell me to try the best stuff on the menu.  So far I had one sandwich with fake chicken with BBQ that was pretty good.  

However, everything else just made me want to go get chipotle.  This place just is not for me.  

This place is good for vegans and non vegans that want to try it and decide for themselves, but mostly just vegans. 

I will give it 3 stars for me and 4 for the vegans, according to a lot of the veggie mites its one of the best places to go.

Recommendation: Vegans and people who like soy ice cream, but nothing to go out of your way to get."
test_2460,Needed to update this as I continue to be very impressed. Never been disappointed and expectations are always exceeded. Had some fantastic sword fish a couple of weeks ago.
test_2461,"the crepes are HUGE! they aren't that cheap, but crepes everywhere aren't that cheap anyways. we got a spinach and mozzerella one (i forgot the name) and then for dessert, we got a strawberry one (again, i forgot the name). two crepes between 3 girls. we were super stuffed afterwards. halfway through, we were already full, but it was so good that we had to keep going! i would definitely some back here the next time we're in vegas!"
test_2462,Great place to spend couple hours. Its free. It has a variety of animals. Limited parking.
test_2463,"I'm excited to try my food, however their 45 to 55 minute delivery time is not true. More like an hour and 20 minutes is what it is. Not happy with GrubHub at all."
test_2464,"They have sturgeon and it is always fresh and delicious. 

I've never had a bad time here or had anything I didnt like. 

My favorite: fish platter for two, sturgeon and nova.

American style breakfasts. Jewish deli sammies. Soup: very good. The restaurant stays busy and that makes for always fresh foods. 

This is the place for Jewish Bakery in LV. Cookies, cakes. Yum!"
test_2465,"Great job! Nice staff and quiet environment, also they have a huge variety of shellac colours!"
test_2466,"I mean c'mon, this place is such a GEM! You walk in and get hit with the sweet sweet smell of authentic Vietnamese food! The owner walks around and takes orders/greets everyone and she is so sweet. You can tell her what sort of items you'd like your dish to contain and she comes up with something spectacular. It's nice to be able to do that because there is like 150+ menu items. Can't wait to come back, it's a new favorite of ours!"
test_2467,"So apparently I have this habit, at least last week, of visiting a bar/restaurant during its most dead time. In this case, it was somewhat understandable for Clark Bar & Grill because it was a very uneventful sports week. Regardless, I wanted to check out this place, housed in the old manufacturing warehouse of the historic Clark Bar Candy Co. (RIP) just north of PNC Park.

I wasn't overly impressed with either the menu or beer selections. In fact, there were only five beers on tap and one had just kicked. I ordered the special, a Reuben sandwich with tater tots, which were both decent. I washed it down with a Penn Pilsner (local brew) and then left to go check out another place on the North Side.

This may be a good spot to hit up before/after a Pirates or Steelers game because of its proximity to both stadiums, but I'm not sure I'd venture back otherwise."
test_2468,"We used to love coming to this restaurant, but I must say last night will be our last.   From the beginning our service was horrible - it took our waitress over 20 minutes to even come over to the table and it was downhill from there (it was  busy, but not crazy).   There were six of us, and she opened one bottle of wine, but never asked if anyone else wanted drinks.  Four others did, but didn't get them till way past appetizers (which came out at two different times).   Our salads came out about an hour after we ordered, and dinner way after that.   The chicken and veal parm dishes were very good, as was the veal jolina.  The lamb chops looked good, but were really just average. Unfortunately I had veal piccata and specifically asked about the sauce as I am gluten sensitive - she told me lemon juice, white wine and capers.  Must say I was very surprised when my veal came out smothered in a white pasty sauce and tasted the same.  I couldn't eat it, but the waitress didn't know that because she never came back to the table until well after everyone else was done eating.  She asked me if I wanted something else, but I opted out since I didn't want to make the other guests wait for an hour while I got another entree.  One would think they would not have charged me for that meal, but alas - it was on our bill (which took another 20 minutes or so).  Overall we were all disappointed and will be on a quest to look for a new BYOB.   I don't mind a long relaxing dinner with good service and good food, but this was not it.  Time to move on."
test_2469,"On gift day- gift to pickup, they should have the same time for all as they are wasting my time to wait for a lousy gift,instead I could be playing  their slot, plus their promos is ok, takes too long to make diamond or platinum.. fyi- fire hazard...Mexican restaurant- it's ok, not great.  Never really had issues at Sundance, I think the staff is great. Not too crazy about their help at the players club.
So spend your  money wisely, select your casino wisely too, their machines can be playing slots.
Food and service  pretty good at Twin Creeks, but pricey...lots of parking..I think I will play my money elsewhere, and I was not the only one in line waiting to get gift at 11a, this is friggin ridiculous."
test_2470,"We went there Saturday night  for the whole pig roast they're advertising for Fri-Sun: Sorry, no pig this week. OK, let's have a rack of ribs: Sorry, we're out or ribs. How about the pulled pork? Sorry, I think we're out - hold-on! No, we still have some. So we ordered the pulled pork, some wings, and the Piggly Fries. Result:
- Pulled pork was dry with some sugary flavor, that's it. 
- Wings were small dry overcooked little things
- Fries: So salty, we could hardly eat them (and we're fries lovers!)
- Even the iced tea had a watery flavor

A case of ""won't be back"""
test_2471,We just needed a box spring and went to several places looking for one.  The one we needed was not in stock.  Spencer was the only person we talked to that day who actually looked up the product availability and delivery schedule.  Speedy and excellent customer service.
test_2472,"The best ever. Best service and food. The drinks are perfect. Would eat every day. All my fiends love it as well. They can handle big groups, with reseveration, as well."
test_2473,"I had Rosy for an 80 minute deep tissue--great pressure and relaxing pace. I have had massages all over the U.S,Mexico,Italy,Dominican,Jamaica...it was one of the top ten massages I have had,and I've had many--at least once a month for the last 18 years...the price was good compared to the hotel I was staying at and I walked back to the[Aria Hotel]on the strip--it was a 8$ cab ride from that end on the way there."
test_2474,I like this place! Our waitress told us that the new owners have been in for 6 months. They changed the layout a bit and it feels very open. Even inside seating has a nice outdoor feel because the windows are huge and open. Nice patios and lights and atmosphere. Excellent happy hour menu. Good food and drink selection. Nice neighborhood place.
test_2475,"I went through the drive-thru, gave the guy a complicated order. I got like 20 types of burritos and tacos. He got it right the first time, he was very friendly and professional. His name is Nick. I will definitely go back to this location because of him. I wish all Taco Bell workers value their jobs like this guy. Thanks, Nick."
test_2476,"Thank god. After the Yadkin Valley wine bar at CLT got swept away by ""all the brands you love!"" (no), this airport became far less interesting. But Beaudevin brings some of that goodness back. The focus is not local, but then again, that's probably a good business decision since you need to play into a much wider market than wine geeks. The food is decent, the service is great, and the wine options were interesting."
test_2477,"I have to agree with everyone else here and say this place is awesome. There were and still are so many things I want to try. There was 4 of us and they all felt the same way so we kinda ordered a variety of things and split it. Meatball Sub, Chicken Parm Sub, Meat Pizza, and White Pizza. I have to say without a shadow of a doubt that the meatball sub was the best I have ever had to date, the chicken parm was delish and the pizza was just above average but not the best I have had. 

I want to try their Italian Sub. Per the pics it look delish."
test_2478,"Even though my first time,  made to feel at home by the great ladies at the grill.   I'm on East coast time so my dinner was not at peak times but every thing was hot,  fries crisp,  helpful to make my pick.   A must stop."
test_2479,this is the WORST cleaners I have ever been to. I have had to iron my cloths after I pick them up. Also have 2-3 extras creases in my dress pants but the best is when you get to customer service. They wait on you in pajamas and bed room slippers. Please save your self some grief and go some where else!
test_2480,"I was in Cleveland for a wedding. 
I had a hair/make up appointment at the Beachwood Mall location.
I put ""Beachwood Mall"" in Google Maps.  I arrived at the Beachwood Mall and saw a ""Dino Palmieri"" sign so I went inside and the receptionist told me I was at the ""La Place"" location and the ""Beachwood Mall"" location was 'across the street.'  So, I got back in my car and went out of the parking lot to the street and started driving around.

I got in touch with someone at the ""Beachwood Mall"" location who was able to give me correct directions and told me they were just across the 'parking lot' from the ""La Place"" location.  By my definition, 'across the street' and 'across the parking lot' have different meanings.  

A half hour later, I finally found my way back to the Beachwood Mall, into the mall up to the salon.  Since I was so late, they changed the people who I was originally scheduled with (understandable, I guess).  

The girl who ended up doing my make up (I can't remember her name) did a good job. 

The girl, Catherine, who did my hair, was another story.  I requested a blow out with a couple of loose curls.   I have had MULTIPLE blow outs and as soon as she started drying my hair, I could tell something was not right.   I kept telling her I just wanted a blow out with a couple of very loose curls and I wanted it to look smoothe.  She kept putting in several, very tight curls.  Catherine kept telling me the curls will drop as the day goes on. The woman who was originally suppose to do my hair, Inez, ended up trying to fix it but the more she tried to fix it, the worse it looked.  Totally not what I wanted (I did not sign up for the ""Nellie Olson"" look) and Catherine has a lot of work to do to get to where she needs to be, in my opinion.

When I called to make the appointment, I mentioned I was from Minneapolis and was getting my hair/make up done for a wedding.  At that time, it would have been nice if the person I spoke with would have called out the fact that your ""La Place"" and ""Beachwood Mall"" locations are so close together.  The reminder text I received just said ""Beachwood.""

A few months beforehand, I had spent a lot of time researching a place to get my hair/make up done and your salon got the best reviews on Yelp.  In hindsight, I would have been better off just doing my own hair/make up."
test_2481,"I bought a living social deal to get a shellac/gellish manicure for my wedding. I showed up late but she still squeezed me in and did a great job. One week later my nails still look perfect. 

The space is: a bit hard to find. Off Independence in the coliseum shopping center/strip mall which is mostly empty. It's in the Salon Central shop at the end of the strip, so you won't see any outside signage (trust that GPS). Inside there are many small salon shops (much like a doctor's office complex), so use the signs to find Nicky. Her shop is small but economical, clean, and colorful. She also has candy for sale. Dangerous for those of us who will begin to crave m&ms if we see them at 9:30am. 

The shellac manicure: was awesome and informative. Nicole went out of her way to explain each step of the process, why she was doing it, and how it differed from your run of the mill mani. She did a great job squaring off my nails as she filed them, and even though I was 20 minutes late, and she had another appointment coming up, she still did an awesome job and I didn't feel like anything was lacking. 

Tip: for those of you getting a first time shellac, know that there aren't that many polish colors available (this is just in general, not particular to Nicole). She had a nice iridescent peach color that looked great and appropriately bridal. 

Additional info: Nicole guarantees shellac polish the first week and will do fill-ins for a discounted price."
test_2482,"I have been using Simply Housekeeping for 4 months now and I am thrilled with their service!  Rose is very professional and prompt with communication.  The crew does an excellent job, and often cleans more than I expect.  Management does quality assessments as well, they are all about top notch service.  I definitely recommend this cleaning company.

Rose contacted me to see if I would be interested in having my windows cleaned through her other company, Precise Window Cleaning.  I jumped at the offer and was very pleased with the results."
test_2483,"I've shopped at three different Copps stores in the Madison area. The Junction Road store, Whitney Way store and The Century Ave store in Middleton. After shopping way too long at the Whitney Way location I finally had to throw in the towel. Just some of the issues there  were-- lack of enough cashiers, no restocking of product, no facing of product, charging full price on items that were supposed to be on sale and the deli lady not wearing gloves and scrapping the spoon against her skin to get product off her hand - YUCK. I had to inform the salad bar lady that there was fuzzy mold on the berries  on the jello salad- double YUCK. 
I tried the Copps on Century Ave but the store is a little too small for my needs.
Finally I switched to the Junction Rd location. A smaller store than the Whitney Way location but I tried to make it work for me.  Some of the same issues plague this store - no product on the shelf, no facing product, the fruit is consistently not  very good. I thnik the deli people are better and the seafood men always seem helpful but they could keep the meat counters stocked much better!  The younger checkers aren't very friendly, but the older ladies are pretty good. This store does a better job of actually giving you the sale price they advertise.  But today was the last time I'm shopping there. I think a lot of their better employees have quit to go work for the new HY-VEE in town.  I got home and didn't have my rotisserie chicken - couldn't believe it. The bagger put absolutely everything in my cart except - DINNER. I called the store and asked them to deliver it to my house and they said No, eventhough it was completely the baggers fault. HY-VEE opens next week  - THANK GOD!  No more Copps."
test_2484,"We have lived in the neighborhood for almost a year and didn't notice this place until we went to the nearby Selwyn Ave Pub! So we checked it out late on a very busy Friday night. Got lucky in getting seated as a couple just left. 

So, here's what we gathered. First, this place is run by Greeks, which typically means you'll get good food at affordable prices. Check. And that's exactly what we got. Started with their mushroom cream soup, made with baby portabellas. VERY yummy! Then I ordered the meatloaf with the mushroom duxelle reduction, wrapped in BACON! How could one go wrong with anything wrapped in Bacon??? And for under $14, this was a STEAL! My wife ordered the Chicken Souvlaki (the Greek influence) which were GREAT! Had that classic Greek flavor - the fresh lemons and herbs. Yummy!

Decent wine list, and had some very good wines by the glass. And the ""piece de resistance"" was the dessert. Had the apple crumb pie with fresh caramel sauce and bourbon ice cream. This was heavenly! I've had apple crumb cakes/pies in many restaurants, and this one was very scrumptious in comparison.

Our bill was under $60 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 full glasses of premium wine, and a dessert! I don't care where you come from, this simply is a great value given the quality of the food.

We can't wait to come back so we can try the many other things on their menu. Actually, we want to go to Ilios Noche in Ballentine, their sister restaurant which features more traditional Greek, like my favorite, Mousaka. Because this is a neighborhood ""gem,"" you'll have to plan appropriately. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that they have live music too! More jazzy than rock, but an unexpected treat nonetheless!"
test_2485,"This location is great for me as it is close to where I live. It's also one of the larger ones I have been to and has a more floor space dedicated to their Men's line than others. Since it is not located in a shopping mall like the Eaton's Centre, they also allow dogs into the store as they leave a water bowl and some treats to encourage four-legged shoppers.

The staff I find are helpful when you need them and they are plenty of change rooms if you want to try before you decide. The slight negative is if they do have what you are looking on floor for but it is in a box according to their inventory tracking system, they don't open the box during store hours but can hold the product for you for the next day.

If you don't live in the neighbourhood and are taking the TTC, it's not the most convenient location. If you plan to drive, because you're far enough from both Eglinton and Lawrence, you'll probably find street parking.

I'm not going to review their clothing as I reserve that for their own website but I do really like it. I'm also not much of a yoga person so I will add that I enjoy their line of running wear as it leads into my next topic, their run club.

Tuesdays at 6:30pm, this store is the meeting place for their run club. If you're a serious marathoner or even half-marathoner, this might not be the place for you. If you want to run a nice evening 5k with a nice group of people, then this is right for you. Routes are planned in advance and posted in their Facebook group and they usually target a 5k or 10k race somewhere in the city as motivation.

On the basis of the location (for me), the men's section, service, and the run club, I give the 5-star rating."
test_2486,"I've really want this place to succeed as its in the neighborhood. However the inconsistency with meats, usually towards the rancid end, is increasingly frustrating. Most recently, the kelbeisa that I purchased, which they have a pretty good reputation for, was of a weird  crumbly pseudo-sausage consistency and full of sodium. Once in a while, if your timing is right, you can get some good quality high-end meats. However, typically selection is very slim with questionable freshness and cleanliness."
test_2487,"My friend and I went tot he zupas on Rainbow and 215 in Las Vegas, NV today and she asked for menu items with NO QUINOA because she is very allergic. She asked the lady in the front multiple times and then asked if the wheat bread had any and they adamantly said NO. As soon as she took a bite she could feel her face getting itchy and swelling. We asked the employee and he said no it has no quinoa in it. Then he comes back 5 min later and says actually it does. By this time she was swelling and she had to run out to get Benadryl. The GM there was rude and asked ""what do you expect me to do? Next time ask a manager"". This was insane. So not only did they give us the wrong information and cause an allergic reaction, but then they blamed it on her!!! You should be ashamed. You don't care about customers at all. I will never step foot in there again."
test_2488,"I was told about The Dog Stop by one of my new neighbors I checked out the website and it sounded really great  so decided to stop in to have a look around.  

The entrance of the place is like a store and they  have a lot of healthy,hard to find food dog food and treats, which is pretty convenient.  I asked the girl at the front desk if she could give me a tour of the rest of the Kennel at that time and I was told that they had ""too many dogs"" and I would have to make a appointment to see the rest of the place.  I made my ""tour"" appointment for this week.

I am sorry to say the tour did not go as well as I was hoping.  The smell when I  walked into the back was sickening.  A combination of dried urine, and scented candle.  I understand they are dogs and it was raining outside but still I don't think it should have smelled this bad.  They have two smaller play areas  and there were only about 5 dogs in one and the other had approximately 25-30 little to medium size dogs.  The murals on the wall were cute but my dog does not really care about murals. There was a mop bucket and a running fan in the area with the dogs.   I was told that the dogs were monitored but I did not witness a person in that play area at that time. The outside access was closed off because it was raining. There is another large area in the back and there were a very large number of dogs in with one person looking after them.  It also had a mop bucket, some weathered looking pieces of climbing bridges, a big fan and an empty baby pool.   There were also a few play toys thrown around . Again the outside area was closed off.  There was a long conveyor belt with fencing on the sides for the dogs to get up to the boarding area.  I was not able to see that area because they were cleaning?  That baffles me  because made an appointment for a tour and I thought that meant the whole place. 

The information on the website for this place is misleading.  I was expecting a more pulled together professional atmosphere but that is not what I saw on the ""tour"" and  is the primary reason I decided to write a review.  After my tour  I decided that I was not interested taking my dogs to this Kennel.  It might be fine for some but my standards are higher than what they had to offer."
test_2489,"Honestly, I was dreading setting up an HVAC appointment for a diagnostic check on the ac unit at our new house. I called around, even used a referral from our realtor but just as I was dreading, they all seemed shady. I came across AZ Dukes of Air on Yelp and figured I give them a try. Wow! They were great to deal with over the phone and by email! They're an old school mom and pop shop; John's wife Tonya does the administrative work while John runs the HVAC work. I love it! Since we bought a foreclosed home, our move in date kept moving, and moving, and moving some more. So, I kept having to call Tonya and move our appointment time. I felt terrible and flaky but Tonya was more than understanding and happily changed my appointment time - several times. 

I was bracing myself for a ridiculous ""service charge"" just to take a look at my ac unit but it was actually very reasonable - I believe I paid around $40 for the diagnostic check. I'll take that! But I still had my reservations - ok, so low fee to check out my ac unit and then comes the bait and switch? Nope! I knew my unit was original to the house so I was just assuming it was going to be a lot of work to bring it up to working order. But, thankfully, Robert gave me great news: although it looks old, it's actually running very well. I mean, what? That's not what an HVAC person is supposed to say?? Aren't you supposed to try to tell me my unit is old and I need a new one?! You're actually telling me the truth?! (Excuse me while I pinch myself.)

So, all in all, I loved my experience with AZ Dukes of Air. They were great to work with, honest, and charged a reasonable fee for their spectacular service. I will definitely recommend them for any HVAC needs!"
test_2490,"Totally love this place.  Food is decent, service is very good, great selection of beers.  Plenty of TV's properly tuned to sports (and sometimes golf).  Love to just sit at the bar and dream about never going home"
test_2491,"Car that was provided was old and had issues (Chrysler 200 Convertible).  I am a business traveler, I know when to buy car insurance. I have premium AMEX card (covers high $'s for rental) and great car insurance. The guy at counter tried to sell me insurance even though I didn't need it, then kept on cursing in slow tone. I can hear you, hello. May be he wanted me to hear it. He kept on saying shit shit and F word too. That's ridiculous, never coming to advantage again.

Don't get any convertible there, all they have shitty is old Chrysler 200's. Car was so bad, we had issues with pickup and car jerked a lot. Remote didn't work to convert the car, have to sit in and use inside button. When I told they guy at return, he said - all convertible are old and have issues and not sure why they still keeping it. Hint** Cause people who are renting are mostly visitors to LV and might not return. Guess what, I will return but will take my business somewhere else."
test_2492,"I had a great experience purchasing my car from Camelback Lincoln. Rudi was very professional, considerate, and helpful throughout the entire process. He follows through and is very honest. My car is very nice and everything went better than planned. I really have changed my mind about the car-buying experience because of the service, professionalism, kindness and support I received..."
test_2493,"Always amazing! They've got it goin' on for sure...food with flavor, heart and soul! 

For me, it was love at first bite back in day at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market on their ""Truckin' Good Food"" food truck! Now, I continue my fare affair here at the Cr√™pe Bar, where they've amplified everything in the most excellent way. 

This is my number one place to recommend to friends and each and every one of them loves it just as much as I do. Classic favorite for me is the Papa K, but everything is delicious. Honestly, it's like asking me what my favorite song is...impossible to choose! Oh! I definitely don't want to forget to mention their amazingly creative seasonal goodness... Whatever you decide to go with - I promise you'll be in flavor heaven."
test_2494,Thursday lunch tacos for $1.50 and up. Friendly staff and atmosphere. Great place to relax after the gym.
test_2495,"Every once in a while, you find something that changes you... this crepe I got changed me.

I am not a big fan of crepes. I don't really seek them out... but this. WOW. Imma gonna say that again. WOW. We decided to get take out and eat back in our room, on our beds, and watch tv... ahahaa. 

I got a Crepe D'Anjou (I think that's what it was called... like three of us ordered it). I got it the way they make it: a crepe with almond paste, pears, candied walnuts, whip cream drizzled with caramel sauce. My friend opted to get it with chocolate sauce instead of caramel. I was going to get it without the nuts, but that would have been a huge mistake! This is the best crepe I have ever had. Since I am not a crepe eater, this is the best dessert-instead-of-dinner I ever had. EVER HAD. The smoothness of the almond paste with the slight grittiness of the pears... the crunch and sweet of the walnuts... everything just worked so well together. 

This isn't a full serve place. You place your order at the window and wait for your number to be called. Then you grab your scalding hot container and wish you asked for a bag to carry it away in. While waiting, a woman came up to the counter. When the cashier asked if she wanted anything, she just breathed deep and said no and stood there for a while... 

Now that I am back home, I am wandering the streets looking for this. My friend is so desperate to have this again, she wants to buy a crepe pan and have us experiment at home to figure out how to make this. I would come back to Vegas for this crepe alone. No, I am not crazy. Have one..."
test_2496,"Don't let the word suites fool you, a better name for this place is roach motel,   this place is over run by roaches and drug dealers. and carman at the front desk is not very friendly.   this place use to be nice   will never have relatives stay here again."
test_2497,"Something in our order was wrong and I told the waitress and she got super defensive saying that she confirmed with us and we said it was okay. Though that's not how we remembered events going down, she still argued she was right. She was so rude that I was in shock. She continued to be rude and short the rest of the meal. The food came out quick but there was truly nothing special about it. There was no salt so there was absolutely no taste. I visit Vegas from LA often and am always eating at new places, but I will definitely not return here or recommend it to anyone I know in Vegas."
test_2498,"i'm super conflicted on this review. i joined about 40 others for a surprised party at gordon biersch on saturday night. our party was tucked in the back corner on the east side of the bar. the space had an adjacent patio, which i thought was really cool. until the hostesses started seating guests that were not part of our party on that patio. 

on one hand, service at the bar was most excellent. each time i trotted up i had, within seconds, another light beer was in my hand - that means i have one happy husband, so naturally, i was stoked. bartender was happy to refill my water and give me a fresh lemon wedge (hey someone's got to drive right?!).

on the other hand, i found it odd that the restaurant chose to walk other guests through the party to the patio ... i really felt for those people. our party of 40+ was crammed into a small space to begin with, and on top of that hostesses were leading diners through the crowd to seat them at patio tables. i understand patio = prime seating, but pushing your way through a crowd to get to it isn't appetizing. the party area was so small i couldn't have gotten to the food display if i wanted to - there were way too many people in our small space. if the restaurant had decided to allow our party to use the patio (which only had 4 tables on it to begin with) i think the other diners and our party would have been much more comfortable. 

in my mind, all this comes together as a 2 star review, with no disrespect intended for the fantastic bartender."
test_2499,"Let's see, $40 for crab legs that aren't fresh.  I thought I was at Red Lobster.  Won't be going back."
test_2500,"O'Noir was an awesome dining experience. I have came here twice, both times with a groupon.

After making reservations, we paid for parking for two and a half hours on the streets close by. Two and a half hours were a little tight for both times, I would recommend paying for three hours.

You will be able to choose your meal before hand, appetizer, main and starter. The options were:

Being a little curious of what I was eating, the plating of the food, etc. I was happy to see a waiter carry two plates of food in the dark dining hall before I was seated inside. The dishes are well plated, as well as a restaurant would if you could visually see the meal.

Once we stepped in, it was PITCH BLACK. HOLY MOLEY, I've never seen something as dark as this in my entire life. There was absolutely no sign of light in here. My ears felt extra sharp as I heard other people talking very close to me, my sense of touch was something that was also important, as I had to feel everything in front of me and around me. Approximation was INSANE as you literally had to approximate everything around you. The waiters slash waitresses are amazing at what they do, guiding you through the dark dining room. They carefully explained what I had in front of me based on the direction they were in as I sat down. 

I absolutely loved the meals. Feeling a little spontaneous, I decided to go with a surprise main. I was delighted to find out that it was one of their selected items, the shrimp... I literally scraped off my dish to every drop of sauce because I wasn't sure if there was something still inside.

What I phenomenal experience, I would definitely bring some relatives here when they visit."
test_2501,"Terrible lairs! I was misquoted, tricked into an insurance plan that covers ""anything"" but my given situation, and threatened to be sent to collections. 

Upon returning my car, I was told by the 2nd staff member of E-Z Rent-A-Car, that the damages would be covered under the insurance I purchased through them.

Mind you, the damage was completely not my fault. I was driving on the freeway and a rock hit the windshield. Then, TWO months later I receive an email saying I'm being sent to collections for not paying for the damages. They had my correct email, as they sent my confirmation email without issue. 

And, the pictures I took of the damage compared to the pictures they emailed me were drastically different.  

If you're reading this, trust me, don't do busy with a shady company just to save a few bucks; it's not worth it."
test_2502,"We enjoyed the pizza here.  Neapolitan style is our favorite kind of pizza, but if you don't like it you won't like this place.  The ""burnt"" comment from another reviewer relates more to style than actual failed execution I think.

Our service was fine.  We didn't experience any of the issues identified by other reviewers.  It does have a ""we're trendy"" vibe, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if they get snooty with some people."
test_2503,She was really nice and did a great job but it took 3 days get my skirt just for shortening.
test_2504,"Came in an ordered 3 different types of sushi 6pc, while we decided on our main course. We ordered a Malaysian Thai curry with a couple of bowls of rice.

The sushi came out within 1 minute... Odd... Some pieces were stuck together. Whatever we move on. **Edited: I believe the sushi is freshly made to order.**

The Malaysian Thai curry comes it within 3 minutes! Wth at least pretend to cook it... **Edited: as per the response below, the chicken is fried and added to a pre made sauce. I'm not a fan of this practice and a good curry would be made to order.**

Threw it on our small table for 2 while we were just starting to eat the sushi. Very annoyed.

I never expect good service from Chinese restaurants, and this was on the same page.

Food was ok - the Malaysian curry is supposed to be spicy but wasn't at all, more sweet than anything.

Large menu, lot of choices between Chinese and Thai. But I guess everything is premade to accommodate such a large menu."
test_2505,"This is by far some of the best service I've ever had, we lost the only key to our car I called him and they were out here in 30 minutes and had a key made in 10 minutes. Good prices also! I suggest them!"
test_2506,I had the sunset and the coconut sorbet.  The sunset is phenomenal....so fresh and fragrant and tropical...   I am done with all the other ice cream places!!! They give you samples of any flavor you want to try.  Nice nice people and a super addition to Matthews
test_2507,"I was urged by a friend of mine to hit this buffet, as I had missed it on my Vegas trip last year. We went on a Sat night where it was supposed to be ""gourmet"" night with more selections. It was a pricey buffet, at $77 for both of us. The line was insane. It wrapped around most of the casino. What was horrible about it, was that the buffet on a SAT night, in Las Vegas, closes @10pm. We waited (along with about 100 people behind us) for over an hour to get to the cashier to pay. By that time, it was 9:40pm. I was sure my info was incorrect and the staff would tell me they were open to at least 11. I asked the cashier and she said ""No we close @10"". I said, you are telling me, that I have 20 minutes to inhale my food for $77??"" She said the buffet closes at 10, but they dont put the food away till 10:30, so run around like a nut doing supermarket sweep and fill as many dishes as possible and sit and eat at your table.. I was going to leave, but then I thought I wasted SO MUCH TIME waiting to eat here, and in thinking of my fellow yelpers, I wanted to add my honest review to this site, so I stayed. I also told the staff that they need to have a staff member block off the line, or have a sign there that says ""No entry after this point"", or no entry after 9pm, because all those poor people behind us, who also waited 11/2 to 2 hours to eat would be kicked off the line when it closed @10. Not nice to have people there wasting their time in Vegas when there are 1000000000 other places they could be eating.
The food was not impressive. They had awful, runny,  split crab legs, sub-par sushi, very tough meat (I had a few different piece of lamb), God awful Chilean sea bass, which is one of my fav dishes, so that was even more disappointing, I also tried the elk and ostrich because it was there. But it was too gamey for me. The lobster ravioli was good, as were the hand rolls. But certainly not worth the wait or the price. You can get the crab legs in almost every other buffet in Vegas. 
We were also SO SICK after we finished eating! The food went right through us both. We joked about having a $77 laxative. 
Mirage buffet stood out- it had many different sections and offerings. AND- if you LOVE seafood, do yourself a favor and hit the Rio seafood buffet. (There's a free shuttle from the Paris hotel.)  That buffet is in a class by itself. Please see my review. I would not return or recommend the Bellagio buffet. I guess if this was the only buffet you hit in Vegas, you might be impressed. Having been here on vacation before in LV, I have seen way nicer spreads for less $. On an upnote, the hotel itself is gorgeous, and def worth a look in the flower conservatory or see the world's largest chocolate fountain. Good gelato and desserts there.

************UPDATE**********
I was so annoyed by my buffet experience that I sent part of this review to Bellagio, hoping they would re vamp their line set up, as to not leave customers out in the lurch with no dinner or food they had to pay $77 for and then scarf down because they close at 10pm. Shockingly to me- the manager called me (now that Im back in Nyc) and offered to comp me 2 tickets to eat there again (which I quickly told him I never would- even for free), or get a refund. So I told him to refund our credit card, and they complied. I was very appreciative of this gesture, but I honestly hope they #1 Improve the food there, and #2 Fix the line set up."

test_2509,"This is a nice park, but if you are looking to go to a park where your kid can meet and play with others, this probably isn't the place for you. This park is really quite and barely anyone passed through the entire 2 or so hours we were there. The people who did only stayed for maybe 10-15 min and then left. I don't live in this area (just happened to be close and decide to stop by the park), but it seems like a decent area. One of the slides might have been broken as there was a chain on it so that the kids couldn't go down."
test_2510,"Great atmosphere! Was a band on the Saturday night we were there that was excellent! The beers were wonderful as well, would be back!"
test_2511,"We had Chikkar Cholay, Palak Paneer and Butter Chicken. They were all very tasty. 
The staffs were very friendly. We placed our orders and they brought them to our table.
The price was very reasonable.
We will definitely come back."
test_2512,"I was a little disappointed in how clean my carpets were after using Barefoot Organic. Don't get me wrong, my carpet is very old and light colored so there's a lot of spots and stains on it that will never come out. However, when I have used other services in the past I have seen a marked improvement but after using Barefoot they pretty much looked the same. And I was very surprised that it took 48 hours before the carpets were dry. And that was for the areas where I was able to open windows and turn the fans on high. For the hallway area, it was still damp after 3-4 days.

I am giving them 3 stars, however, because they were so wonderful to work with. Shantell on the phone was very friendly and helpful. She went out of her way to accommodate my schedule and was very easy to deal with. Justin, who came to our home, was also very friendly and courteous. There was no up-charging or haggling over the price. Literally every other carpet cleaning company I have ever worked with I have had to argue over whether the larger rooms in my home should be considered two or three rooms and I usually end up paying about $50 more than I think I should be."
test_2513,"Brasserie Kensington has a very good balance of upscale chic and laid back pub. 
The later it gets, the darker and more romantic it gets. In the early evening it's bustling and lively. They have a very good selection of beer that the men seemed to be very happy with, and a long healthy list of wine that us women really enjoyed.
The menu is a bit confusing. I assumed Brasserie would serve specifically French food, but there's a mix of burgers and fries, some French and then....Schnitzel. 
The duck poutine was awesome, my fish was ok. Service was also very ok at the most, but the best part was sitting near the window watching the slow relaxed Kensington life. 
I definately love the later evenings of the Brasserie, when candles are lit and the whole restaurant gets moody and everyone is having wine and cheese platters. Two different atmospheres, and I definitely love just one."
test_2514,"I've been to Jack's a handful of times, mostly for drinks after word. Service was always solid, even when busy. Food was atypical for bar food to me. Doesn't mean bad, just nothing set it apart. But if I'm in that area, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in again."

Very clean and fresh!!!!  Had chicken, carne and quesadilla...   great addition to this complex!"
test_2517,"Yes, their prices are definitely reasonable, and their warranties on re-built items are as good as if the item was brand-new, but their customer service is lacking, and even though they have more than adequate handicapped parking spots, they have NO ELECTRIC SCOOTERS for those of us who are physically challenged by the infirmities of old age.

Their lack of compassion for the handicapped and the elderly among us, is one reason why I cannot recommend them, ever."
test_2518,"Way over priced for the portions I got. Fried pickles was $7.50 and I got 9.... 9 pickle chips for $7.50??? I also got the loaded tater tots and that was an additional $3.50 for the loaded. $3.50 for some cheese sauce, ranch dressing and bacon pieces?! My bill was $20 for fried pickles and loaded tots. Ridiculous!!"
test_2519,"Stayed here for my friends 21st. *drool* we stayed on the top floor in the huge suites. we had a huge master bedroom, two bathrooms, a Jacuzzi tub, two shower head shower and three TVs. VERY nice :]

I felt bad for the maids because we kind of trashed the place but at least we didn't break the door like someone down the hall did. 

The beds were really comfy and the room was always cleaned whenever we left.

But they treated us like Kings & Queens except when we lost our key card. But i saw Questlove and posse it was really nice. Id definitely stay here again!!"
test_2520,Needed to update this as I continue to be very impressed. Never been disappointed and expectations are always exceeded. Had some fantastic sword fish a couple of weeks ago.
test_2521,"Never have I been to this Thai place in Charlotte. We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and it was packed but we did not have to wait too long for a table. We had a party of 4. We started out with some appetizers, Spring rolls, Beef Sate, and a order of Thai Chicken wings. The Spring rolls were excellent - two to an order. The Sate was beef and such a great grilled flavor. The Thai Chicken wings were crispy but could have had more of a Thai flavor, served with a sweet and sour sauce. Our entrees, which we shared were the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken, a order of Pud Thai, which we call Pad Thai? And a order of Pud ma Maung, which was vegetables and cashews and we had Pork added as our protein. All the dishes were very good. Although I never found a Cashew in the Pud ma Maung. The Fried Rice was especially good, just a perfect Thai flavor. We ordered everything with a heat level of #4 and it was not overly hot.   They staff was very nice and very attentive for a very busy little restaurant! I will be coming back !!"
test_2522,"Good was good as Chinese buffets go. The sign advertises seafood which was limited and also said All You Can Eat Crab Legs. Wasn't one crab leg to be found. Sorry, I won't be back."
test_2523,"If anyone knows one thing about how I pick restaurants, a good deal is usually a requirement. I chose this spot because they have a $6 burger meal deal on Tuesdays and I had never been here before. The fact that they serve delicious beers may have played into it as well. ;)

Lately I've been on a chorizo kick and saw they had a chorizo burger on a pretzel bun. Win. It was a toss up though when I came across a turkey burger on a tomato foccacia roll. I'm a sucker for good breads and sometimes that can sway my decision. I stuck with the chorizo and my date had the turkey burger, so it worked out that I got to try both. 

Overall I was pretty underwhelmed by the food. The intrigue was there but they were both missing something to give them a great flavor. It seemed to me that the chorizo burger had too much ground meat mixed in that it distracted from the spice of the chorizo. Both of the buns were delicious though. 

Had a beer with dinner that was my favorite part of the meal. They've got a great selection of brews on tap. Being that it was their own beers brewed in-house, I expected a cheaper price but each beer still cost about 5 or 6 dollars. Paired with the cheap burger night, the tab was still reasonable overall."
test_2524,"The service here is good but food always comes out cold. I only eaten here 4 times even though I am a student. I have had to send all of my meals back to get them warmed up, and I have tried different things on the menu. The only thing I enjoyed eating here was the cookie skillet."
test_2525,"I have always said that I prefer to drop a quarter into a pinball machine and have some fun rather than waste it in a slot machine.  This is the place to do it!  They have so many vintage pinball machines and ""newer"" ones from my own teen years, and most of them are playable.  Basically, if it lights up, you can play it, and they start at a quarter a game, some games being 75 cents for the newer ones.  And it's not just pinball.  There are a few vintage video games, and some older items like an arm wrestling machine, a love tester, a basketball game, and even a nickelodeon from 1921.  They all take real money, not tokens, so you only spend exactly as much as you want.  I spent a couple hours here and only spent about ten dollars.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Las Vegas."

I got my hair cut by Alissa, she was wonderful!  I highly recommend her.  This fun and NON PRETENTIOUS hair salon was exactly what I have been looking for.  

A cut runs $50 but they have $25 off coupons for first timers.
If you would like one, let me know, I will happily give you one!

I am having Alissa do my hair for my upcoming wedding so I will YELP that once it is said and done.

test_2529,"Went on a Saturday night could only get an 8:30 reservation (call before Friday). At 8:30 it was still packed. Much larger than we thought but tastefully decorated and comfortable, the atmosphere is good and upbeat ( a little loud but not terrible ).
The menu is not huge but has some very interesting dishes, after some great service and advice from our server we opted for the red snapper and veal liver mains along with spinach salad and blood pudding starters. We also opted for the table de hote which added desert, amuse bouche and an amazing rhubarb sherbet. Simply put all courses were excellent!! The liver was the best I have had , tender and extremely tasty. In addition, the portions were generous and we left full and happy. 
The service is way above good . Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, and very pleasant. Again a restaurant in Verdun comes through with exceptional service ( side note: we have been to a number of places in Verdun and the service is always exceptional)
As a byow, it is not the cheapest, but the combination of food and service make this a must go destination. We will definitely be returning."
test_2530,This place is awesome! Great place to have fun and grab a drink. Our server Brock was great! Very hospitable and provided great service! Go whack some balls!
test_2531,"The best sushi in AZ bar none. I don't give 5 stars easily, however this place easily earns it. 

Went for my birthday and it was just a lot of fun, one of the best nights out I've had in a while. This restaurant treated me like family going above and beyond what I would typically expect.

The omakase I got was amazing, each piece was fresh full of flavor. There was plenty of variety and almost every piece was a super premium item. Each bite was almost magical. I felt like this plate elsewhere would easily go for at least double what I paid. 

Chef Juno is a lot of fun. You can tell that he really enjoys what he does and his energy is infectious. Every time I've visited, he always sits down and makes sure you're having a good time too. He's also really generous sometimes giving free samples which are really tasty."
test_2532,"Held a small reception here after our Vegas style wedding. It was perfect. The Cordinator ahead of time was so helpful and nice and didn't complain about my 1,000 emails. Lol. 

When we got there we were seated quickly and the since we had a prefix menu it was very smooth. The service was fast and friendly and our server was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic. She was fantastic!The drinks were amazing and everyone loved the food. I hope to make it back to try more things and bunch!

Recommend: Any margarita, Kale Caesar Salad, the guacamole, anything with the beef brisket and the plantains were delicious. Really you can't go wrong. 

Good vegetarian options, too."
test_2533,"I had high hopes from this place after reading wonderful reviews, but in was a big disappointment. To start wid the naan's was too dry. When I compare its tastes and flavones to Afgan restaurant in the same strip plaza, I found there food much better"
test_2534,"Been waiting for this place to open...to our surprise not bad at all. Their food has a lot of flavors. I ordered the Mexican bowl (rice, beans, veggies, fajita chicken) with two different salsa...the tomatillo green salsa is sour and spicy(its great). My husband ordered El Gringo which comes with rice, beans, salad, enchelada, tacos, fajita beef with fresh flour tortilla.  Both of our meats were tasty and have a lot of flavors. The only thing negative I can say is that the fresh flour tortilla gets hard so fast and my husband says that his beef was a little dry other than that It was great. I recommend all of you to try it. The staff are super friendly and attentive . Give it a go!"
test_2535,Love their tacos! Very fresh ingredients and deliciously prepared. They were even good from a food truck as they were running out of ingredients. Their restaurants are ridiculously crowded so be prepared to wait or try to get there at odd times. As good as anything I've had in Mexico and at Rick Bayless's restaurants.
test_2536,"I live about 1000 miles from nearest CONNS store and have never shopped in one. Yet they call me daily trying to collect money from me but won't tell me what I am supposed to owe for. Judging from all the complaints out there, they are an appliance store covering for a pretty shady financial operation. Ignore their calls and don't give them any info."
test_2537,"My husband and I stopped here after a long day of house shopping. I ordered the fall/winter special ""Jack Frost Latte"", my husband ordered the ""Tuxedo"". I really enjoyed mine. I am always a little leery when trying a new local coffee shop, most of the time they are excellent, but every once in a while they are terrible....Beans and Cream was not one of those. I have since been back three times in the last three weeks. I ""work from home"" a lot, which means I work from a coffee shop as to not eat all day and watch T.V. This has been my place. All three times the coffee drinks were great. Prepared well, the coffee smooth. 

I have eaten lunch here as well. That also did not disappoint. I ordered the quiche, my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I liked mine, it was good, but his was better. More filling (thats what I get for ordering quiche). 

Other fun perks of B and C: 
 - You can get local ice cream there
 - You can buy local craft/art items from local artists in the area 
 - There are fresh flowers on the table from a florist down the street
 - children's play area 
 - you can purchase out of the ordinary seeds there 

If you come to visit me I will probably take you here."
test_2538,"I have no idea how I ended up here but I'm glad I did. Looking around, I'm guessing this joint is Korean-based. So I had to test this by ordering something spicy. It was for real. I felt my love handles growing instantly, but it was spicy and delicious. If you think that Del Scorcho sauce at Del Taco is spicy, DON'T try the spicy stuff here."
test_2539,"I'll take one of each please. That is exactly how I felt perusing the beautiful crooks and nannies of J.Glenn. If you are looking for a charming addition to your home, the perfect centerpiece for a house party, a gift for someone you like a whole bunch or just a personal treat for yourself, like jewelry, this is the shop that will have what you're looking for...and it won't be ordinary. 

When I visited the centerpiece of the store was fall. They had beautiful glass pumpkins and plenty more to make your home a little autumn. They also had out the start of Christmas decorations, and I can only imagine what else awaits as we get closer!

Other highlights include a Papyrus section, faux fur throws, fashionable jewelry (at reasonable prices!), an amazing home scents collection (Agraria for cheaper than Neiman), books and baubles for the kiddies, adorable paper placemats...ahhhhhh, I could go on and on, so really the only solution: go there and see for yourself! And given the quality of products and service, the prices are superb. Not once did I experience sticker shock.

It's truly a gem of a home and gift boutique, and I don't think there is anything quite like it in Vegas."
test_2540,We brought our truck  in for an oil change and they did a great job. We got there about 15 minutes before they closed and they got us right in and out. Also I had a coupon that made it $15 and we are satisfied so far. The only reason I give them for stars and not give is some of the staff seemed young and immature. The manager was great. Will come back for an oil change for sure!!!
test_2541,This place is the BOMB!! I wish they had one in Denver..... They have a great section of beers and the food is ole so good. Slap your mom for another bite.
test_2542,Although I went on a Weds. Night for the half off sushi I ended up with a shrimp hibachi meal that I could not even finish! Overall the food was very good and I had plenty of left overs to eat the next day . Our cook was really nice and did all of the normal tricks and what not. I did expect a bigger restaurant when I walked in but I guess it's a good amount of space! It seemed like they had maybe 4 or 5 hibachi tables and then other normal dining room tables for non-hibachi patrons. The table behind us seemed to have an issue with their cook but it looked like the manager took care of that quickly. Overall I would come back it's a decent priced hibachi meal with quick service. The parking in front of the restaurant seems a bit tight not sure if there was more in the back but I can only imagine what it's like on a fri sat night!
test_2543,"I've loved everything I've tried here. They have interesting twists on classic sandwiches and salads. Everything is fresh and delicious! A little pricey especially considering the portion sizes of some of the items, but the quality of the food makes up for it. Very cool atmosphere as well. I also wish the portion sizes of the sides were a little bigger because they're so delicious! Still 5 stars for the taste and atmosphere."
test_2544,"I have found it! The best ramen in Richmond Hill! The ramen is near perfection and the prices are very reasonable!

As a lover of tonkatsu ramen, I absolutely had to get the Hokkaido Ramen (Milky Tonkotsu Soup Base). The soup base was rich and creamy as promised. Not only that, but the pork was amazing!  It consisted of juicy meat, sandwiched between layers of fat that melt in your mouth. To complement such delicious pork, the noodles were also cooked to perfection.

There was also only one server, but it is amazing how much one woman can do! Tonight, the restaurant was packed, yet our server was still so kind and attentive. 

Overall, I had a great experience! This is the first place I would recommend to all my friends who love ramen!"
test_2545,"I was really worried about tooth sensitivity since I've tried (and was never able to finish) about every home teeth whitening system available and always felt excruciating pain with every breath of air that passed over my teeth afterwards! But based on other reviews I gave it a shot and couldn't be happier! My teeth got 5-6 shades whiter and the process was painless. I needed a couple Advil later on that evening but the next day, no sensitivity at all! I can't stop smiling I would eat something fairly close to your appointment because it takes two hours and then you can't eat for two hours after that. I sprayed my teeth with my Waterpic before heading in and didn't have any issues. Treat yourself to a younger smile! You'll be glad you did! At least I sure am! Thank you True Teeth Whitening! I'll be back for maintenance every 6-12 months because I love these results!"
test_2546,"Man oh man oh man!! This is a foodies heaven! Super large portions, fair prices, good services! I mean what more could u ask for! Spend my 23rd bday there with mommy... Gosh those r the best duck i ever had in my life and fried cod are so juciy n tender inside crispy to perfection on the outside. The only problem was not enough source. And ALSO! Y'all need to try their Wonton K! It's a different level!  I do hav small hands but their wonton, two wontons are the size of my fist!!! WTF! N it tastes heavenly... for any shrimp lovers like me.. This is a gift from god! The wrap is so thin you can see the shrimp fillings inside. And inside is big chunks of shrimp so fresh so tender. 
Anyways they got me addicited!"
test_2547,"One of the best shows I have ever seen in Vegas. I saw it for a 2nd time recently and didn't get as much of a thrill as I did the first time but I still enjoyed the show very much! I came into the show not being a Beatles fan but after the show I can't stop listening to their songs on my ipod! If you are a Beatles fan I would definitely check out this show. Lots of cool acts and entertainment.

I believe this is one of the more expensive Cirque du Soliel shows due to it's popularity but I was able to get 2 balcony seats for about $110 each. I have also sat in the limited view seats that are around $95 that were also not bad, but not as exciting as the other seats since you cannot see the whole stage."
test_2548,The portion sizes at this location continue to get smaller and smaller.  It has become so bad that we feel like we are just wasting our money and may soon stop going altogether.
test_2549,"The food at Chino's is absolutely amazing. I'm a sucker for their jerk chicken or their jade red chicken. This place is usually busy however there are instances when it won't take too long to get a meal. Overall, great experience coming to Chino and I always love bringing my friends and family here. When visiting Arizona, you must try to visit this restaurant!"
test_2550,"Outstanding shop. Knowledgeable staff and owners, they understand archery. I would recommend. Give them a try. Indoor range is cool and always clean."
test_2551,"I recently had Clarence come out and update the electrical in both of my bathrooms. He did a wonderful job, was very conscientious about keeping my house clean, used quality parts and the pricing was very reasonable.  His wife Jackie was very courteous on the phone and asked me plenty questions to make sure I was going to get what I wanted when Clarence came out.  Scheduling was easy  and Clarence arrived exactly when he said he would. I highly recommend C. Read and Son Electric!"
test_2552,Very good food.  Great service.   We sat at the bar and had a great lunch.  The Asian wings were some of the best I have ever had.  Bloody marts looked good.... But didn't have one.  Tasty Carne Asada tacos too!!!
test_2553,"Anando serves the best Kacchi Biriyani (rice and meat - beef, cooked together) I have ever tried in the city. Try this with Borhani (a kind of salty and spicy yoghurt drink - good for digestion). 

They serve Kacchi Biriyani only on Friday and Sunday, unless there is any special order. On other days you can try Bhuna Khichuri (rice and lentil cooked together) - my second favorite dish with Beef or Duck curry; or Goat or Chicken Biriyani or Beef Tehari (rice cooked with small pieces of meat). For breakfast or as a light snack try Dhal Puri, or Parata with Bhaji (Vegetables) or Paya (made from trotters or hoof of a cow). All are very delicious. Try Ras Malai or Rice Pudding as a desert. Both are very sweet and yummy! Their Mango Lassi is also my favorite.

It's a family run restaurant. The ambience is very casual, don't expect anything fancy. Price is awesome (for the quantity and quality of the food)! The owner is very chatty and friendly, ask for suggestions. Though Yelp put them in the Indian, Bangladeshi categories, their cooking style is more Bangladeshi (very authentic) than Indian. 

Have fun!

**************************************************

UPDATE June 24, 2017
---------------------------
Anondo has been closed. The owner sold the restaurant to one of his relatives who opened it with a new name ""Red n Green"" just a month ago. Food, service and price are as good as Anondo. ""Kachchi Biriyani"" is still equally delicious."
test_2554,Must go here! Awesome food and Matt is an incredible Chef! I cannot say enough! I will follow him anywhere he goes
test_2555,"Excellent food, price is amazing. Always great! We ordered the family size ginger beef, shanghai noodles in black bean sauce, spring rolls and salt and pepper squid. All delicious and price was under $40"
test_2556,"Abugida is the very definition of a hidden gem: still rough around the edges, ambiance-wise, but who cares? Their food is amazing and the owners and staff are really friendly.

I feel like this is the type of place that will make its reputation on great food, then follow that up by perhaps renovating or moving to improve the ""experience"" factor. I'm rooting for them 100% and have referred several friends and family there. 

A close friend of the family is from Eritrea and has owned and operated a very successful Ethiopian/Eritean restaurant in the northeast. So, we know good Ethiopian food when we see it, and this is very good!"
test_2557,"This place was amazing! Me and my boyfriend like to go to Vegas at least once a year just to relax and we decided to spoil our selfs and stay here, by far the best decision we made. We got a queen suite the bathroom was huge as well as the bedroom had a few steps that led you to the other floor. It's a clean hotel as well as the staff is super friendly. The only thing that was bad about the hotel was the complimentary breakfast, they could do way better especially for the price you pay for the room. But besides the food amazing hotel, and for the makeup lovers a huge saphora downstairs"
test_2558,Just moved into town and must say the best place to have breakfast and lunch with family. Menu had manny good selections and the service was great! Looking forward to come back for lunch:)
test_2559,This bistro will actually satisfy your hunger unlike other modest lunch spots it offers more than the lighter fare of soup/salad/sandwich combos. The pasta dishes steal the show..go for Athena's Garden and add a protein (you won't be disappointed with their spinach dip either ;)
test_2560,"Received awesome flowers for my lady, extremely friendly staff with orders on time unlike any competition in the area"
test_2561,"Chino Bandido is a staple for my sister and I. I'm not going to lie, when describing this place I feel the need to mention that while it's not much to look at on the outside--inside it delivers some of my favorite guilty pleasures.

I encourage anyone who is trying this place for the first time to take a few minutes and allow the staff to guide you thru what they have to offer. With their complimentary taste test , you can try a few of their most popular dishes and learn how to order off of their moderately challenging menu (but once you get it, its super easy). I ALWAYS go for the combination of double jade red chicken, refried beans, and plain fried rice.

The snickerdoodle at the end is perfectly baked. Every time. Love this place."
test_2562,"If you're looking for a clean cut, attention to every last detail, go see Dre at the MLK location on Tuesday, 9/15 from 9-6pm - 1100 N. Martin Luther King Blvd. suite D. Las Vegas , Nv 89106 (702) 636-3911."
test_2563,"I really enjoy the freedom of customization that give guys ya to offer when it comes to their burgers, i put them up there with in n out and habit burger. The only downside is their burgers get soggy if you take too long to eat them so i recommend eating it on the spot and not doing to go. Their fry servings are very big and a little is plenty for one person. I defined recommend trying the Cajun fries and a strawberry shake as those compliment the burger well."
test_2564,"The food was great but the service was beyond exceptional. We had the duck, skate, the pork ribs, the fried chicken, wagyu beef, and the escargot, all accompanied by some wine and beer and everything was wonderful. For a great dinning experience I highly recommend this restaurant."
test_2565,"This dental office is one of the best dental offices in that state! The service is amazing and the appointment was quick. I have been to 3 different dental offices and none has suited my taste... Pristine however, is amazing. I recommend it to anybody looking for a new dental office to go to!"
test_2566,"Visited the Feast Buffet at Palace Station recently for breakfast. There was no line to wait in this weekday morning - making me think this might not be well known. After we were seated - the server came right over and took our drink order. The buffet selection for breakfast was excellent ! They had an omelet station, dessert bar with donuts/danish, salad bar, and many of the usual items such as chicken fried steak, bacon, potatoes, sausage, pancakes, waffles, etc. Everything we had was very good ! We ended up going mutiple times during the week for breakfast. The price was very good and Wednesday is Senior Day where you get breakfast for half price if using casino credits to pay. This turned out to be a great breakfast option while visiting Las Vegas !"
test_2567,"It's entertaining to oversee business deals happening over a meal.  At Regal, I saw a Female try to entice a Male to join an upcoming Yoga UYE.  I wonder what the success rate of getting an average JOE to join any Yoga Class would be, even when it's free?  I'm telling the Female now, better keep your day job(sales).  She's better at that anyways.    :P

As for the Food.

Regal quality food, what that means is that it's the same as the one at Scarborough region.  Probably same as the other 6 or so Regal brand Chinese restaurants as well.  Still curious as to why they didn't have Sui Mai available.  Dim Sum without Sui Mai is like my Friend without Lunch Specials.  Lost & Confused.

As for the Service.

I think we got lousy service from one of the Managers because we're younger(ME) and rowdier(name starts with ""J"").  That's my theory for now but the rest of you can test that hypothesis.  Either that or I'm not Girly voice enough because my Friend got a response after just one try.  At least I got some friendly chatter from the serving ladies.   :D

I'm going back to the less ghetto branch, Scarborough one."
test_2568,"Came in for lunch today because I was intrigued by their plant-based menu. Well they no longer have a plant-based menu... so that was off putting. 

Got their garden tacos, but they were missing the quinoa... which is one of the reasons I chose them! Nonetheless they were delicious, but lacked the protein I would've liked. I wish it was communicated to me prior. 

The front of house staff is okay, some rude some curt some friendly- all in all, not consistent. Food service was slow. 

I would come back with company to try a few more things on the menu, but I'm in no hurry."
test_2569,"I wanted a gyro and this place was a block from our hotel. We got one chicken the other beef. As we were leaving I noticed the fish tank was nasty dirty, odd. We went back to the hotel to eat and it was awful!! Chicken was dry and the beef tasted really weird. It didn't even taste fresh and hot. I hope I don't get sick."
test_2570,"My mom and I arrived at about 12 on MLK Day, it wasn't too crowded but there was a 15 min. wait, no problem. We did end up waiting around during 15 minutes but they were turning  over the tables pretty quickly when  people were leaving so the wait wasn't for lack of organization. The host and hostess (who are also serves so that might explain it) weren't particular welcoming, but they were perfectly nice. There was a decent amount of seating in the waiting area. 
We were seated towards the beam of the restaurant  there seemed to be a draft near our table,  also no big deal but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing is something to be aware of. The server came over and got our drink orders. when she came back we weren't ready to order because it was our first visit. It was about 10 minutes before someone came back to get our order even though we'd seen or server around. When we did order it was not with our original server,  not sure what that was about. 
The menu had a lot of great options it was hard to choose just one, we ended up getting a blueberry pancake to share, I got the breakfast scramble (sans Monterey Jack, bacon instead of ham, and with the Hollendaise  on the side.) My mother got the Greek Fetish omelette. It took a while for the food to come out even though the majority of the people around us already had their food or were leaving.
When the food did come out the pancake was cold (actually cold), my eggs were tepid and the Hollendaise tasted strange and was broken. The omelette was OK. 
Our server finally came to check on our food about 5-10minutes after it arrived. We asked for a new pancake it was fine, the berry compote was bland and it was pretty mediocre. 
All together the meal was about 30bucks, and for mediocre (or in some cases less than mediocre) food and bad service it was not worth it. We will likely not be back, but at least the coffee was decent."
test_2571,"Ordered the honey butter sandwhich and the chicken was very dark. Tasted like the oil was old or burned. Same with the fries, tasted old and burnee. Disappointed because I was told this place was good."
test_2572,"Defalcos is the kind of place that makes you want to move closer to it.  Every neighborhood should seriously have a place like this near by.  Small deli/market/restaurant that delivers the goods and flavors.  

I've had a half beef half sausage whole sandwich on a roll.  It was the best damn roll I've ever had in my life.  Crunchy outside crust, and soft hot on the inside.  Life changing.  The sandwich was big enough for two full grown men to share and came with au jus and marinara.  

I also tried the Italian sub and the procciutto sandwich both were legit.  The shop has some yummy looking treats plus wine and beer. 

If I lived near here I'd try everything on the menu.

Outstanding!"
test_2573,"On September 7, 2007, my friends and I checked in at Platinum for two days/two nights. That evening, we dined at the hotel restaurant where I ordered a medium-well steak that was served raw.  I got food poisoning a couple hours later and even had to delay maid service until the next evening because of my sickness.

The next afternoon, a front desk jerk-clerk named Jason phoned our room, asking why we hadn't checked out.  I informed him that I reserved the room for two days and two nights. He snapped: ""The room is already booked for another party.""  So I asked him to please schedule us for another day because it must be a mistake since he ALREADY charged my card.  Jason put me on hold briefly and then said: ""OK, you're all set."" 

After check-out on September 9, I made an in-person complaint to the restaurant manager.  Moments later, another hotel patron at the front desk exclaimed to us: ""The restaurant is sh*t!  Don't eat there ever again!"" 

However, it was even more shocking when front desk clerk Jason suddenly interrupted our private conversation with the restaurant manager and blurted with a sarcastic laugh: ""I'm curious to see this steak you're talking about.""  So I showed him (I saved my evidence in the fridge & STILL have a photo) and his mouth dropped wide open.

There was no legitimate reason for Jason's incessantly rude demeanor.  He sparked such extreme interest in the restaurant issue but previously failed to express the same urgency in investigating the booking mix-up with our room.  Never throughout my worldly travels have I encountered such a lack of organization, professionalism, and common courtesy on behalf of any other service provider. 

We paid $750 for our room while anyone can receive the aforementioned treatment on a public street free of charge.  Furthermore, the hotel and restaurant did NOTHING to rectify the problem...I didn't even get a meal refund.

Here's a Better Business Bureau consumer complaint. This hotel got an F!

test_2574,"I'm not sure if this was the same exact location I went to because my cousin was the driver. But I will tell you that this place is sooo GOOD!!! 
10/23/16: My cousin brought my boyfriend and I to this place. We were visiting from Hawaii and she told me there were poke bowls too so I said ""Sure!"" Got there and I was already amazed that they have sushi burritos!!! And it's for $10.50!!! I could of made my own sushi burrito, but I felt I would be overwhelmed by the things I could put in so I got the Twin Dragon. It came with spicy ahi, shrimp tempura, crab, unagi sauce, and other delicious things that I can't recall. I thought I would still be hungry, but that thing was so filling! We also had their homemade taro chips with cheese sauce and that was good too. If I could change something I would add a soft shell crab in my sushi burrito. I only saw the option after I ordered. Back home it's around the same price, but a little smaller."
test_2575,"Had the Bristol crepe with goat cheese substituted for Brie, paired with a vanilla latte. Seriously some of the best food you can buy in this city... All for less than $15! Truly a gem with great service and great food. Highly recommend this place for anyone visiting or local."
test_2576,"Over...wait for it...rated.

Okay, so the Lowland Group Cafe (insert name of one of 10 different Milwaukee locations) is no big news to me. I lived right down the street from the Cafe Centraal location in Bay View, and while the meal was always solid, it was nothing special. However, they do make a bloody good Bloody Mary, and I was hankering for some booze on this particular evening!

After seeing Suffragette at the lovely Sundance theater, my best gal pal and I headed over on a blistery Winters eve around 6:45. 30 min wait. Ah, what? Okay. I'm not the kind of gal who usually waits that long (I'm usually always mad hangry and need to eat immediately) I decided to stick it out for the bloody mary's.

Atmosphere. One word. LOUD (as fuck).
I was yelling at my friend the whole evening, went home hoarse.

Bloody: Ordered the Godfather which is a Caprese Bloody. So darn good. Also, 11 dollars. Literally cost more than me meal.

Food: Eh, average. Ordered a warm hummus plate which was described as warm hummus, roasted veggies and pita. Didn't realize the veggies were piled on top of the warm hummus as opposed to use for dipping. Wasn't practical, but taste was decent! Ordered a cone of frites and got, fries. I'm sure they are still working themselves out, but frites are (from my humble understanding) supposed to be twice fried crispy lil things. These were big ol honking things with tons of potato. Delicious, but not frites.

To top off the average evening, we were sat upstairs, which has a glass window on top (I'm assuming which can be moved for warm weather) Great idea, but drafty as HECK on a 40 degree, 25 mile an hour wind night. 

Also, we were seated next to a LOVELY family with 5 children, all of whom were running around like god dang monkeys while the parents ignored the children running into waitresses. Get your demon seed under control Madison!

Overall, eh. Food is okay, booze is great, but the atmosphere made the evening far less enjoyable then it could have been."
test_2577,"This place is just open today. My son wants to try it. The facility is nice and clean . It's been remodeled from previous Yummy Buffet. The remodeling is nice , the food selections look great. As I sample small portions of each dishes , my expectation of good looking dishes is melting away. Most of the saku tuna slices are still half frozen and even the farm hamachi is also half frozen. The hot dishes were good looking but tasteless . The soups are bland."
test_2578,"I had several pleasant visits to the Walnut Grill in Bridgeville and am no doubt of fan, so I expected the same from the Robinson location. Friday night 7:00- we sat at the bar and there were a few empty bar stools it was a tad crowded.  There were two bartenders working - a man with a pony tail who was rocking out each order and another who didn't seem to want to be bothered?!  We grew tired of the challenge of trying to get another drink so decided to go else ware."
test_2579,Food was absolutely incredible!..Had the chicken burrito and girlfriend had the chicken nachos. Wait was a little long but worth it. Employees nice as hell and I got a free drink!
test_2580,Great wings..menu looks delicious ..looking forward to trying the cuban sandwich on the way back through here..friendly and helpful bartender
test_2581,"I normally don't post reviews but felt I should after seeing such negative reviews. My car wouldn't start so I called Progressive roadside assistance and requested a flat bed tow truck. Immediately after hanging up with Progressive I receive a text message and a phone call letting me know that the estimated time for arrival was 60 minutes. Since I had nothing to do I decided to look up this tow company and after reading all the negative reviews I began to worry. I only saw two recent positive reviews so I held on to hope. After about 40 minutes I see on the app that tow truck is on its way. The tow truck shows up in about 15 minutes and manages to jump my car. I decide that I still want it towed because I noticed the check engine light is on. The driver is very friendly and courteous and takes my car and me to the mechanic shop. I would say this was a great experience in a bad situation. I would definitely recommend their services. They made a bad situation better by being on time, providing updates and having a very friendly driver."
test_2582,"Love this place!  The only place I can get some cartage bolts and a MAX485 transceiver!  It is a bit daunting, and does not always have everything you need.   Though it is still better then having to drive north or west to get all of your electronic and home repair hardware!"
test_2583,"Forestiere was sublime, Vegetarian (daughter is vegetarian) was one of the best ever."
test_2584,"Shorter lines compared to Los Angeles. We got the Fairfax sandwiches and the slut. The slut was delicious even though it's pretty much a poached egg with potatoes in a jar, and the Fairfax is a sandwich with an egg...that's it. :)"
test_2585,"Mama Pop taste in the middle of a shopping mall.  Doesn't get any better than this!!  

With tons of eats in Miracle Mile and even inside Planet Hollywood, I'm amazed on how often my food choice out here comes down to D' Amore's Famous Pizza.  Let's get somethings straight, I don't eat pizza often.  And when I do, I am often disappointed. D' Amore's has been there for me, especially past midnight when almost everything in here is closed.  

Staff is amazing.  Not one Associate ever forgets to greet you.  You can tell that at this establishment customer service is their priority.  

Now for their pizza.  Some people have their preferences like Chicago deep dish or NY style thin crust.  I am a deep dish fan myself, but find D'Amore's thin crust a great change of pace. Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Domino's, and the rest of the commercialized joints don't even compare.  The pizza is greasy like it should be, but you can still taste all the ingredients. Never too saucy, which is my preference. After a few bites, you'll forget that you're even in a mall.  You'll feel like you're in that Mama Pop hole in the wall type pizzeria.  That's how it should be.

Whether it's a long day shopping the mall, partying with friends at the bar or losing a grip at Planet Hollywood, I at least know that I have one consistent...a stop at D' Amore's before I head home."
test_2586,"This place is like a little dirty hole in the wall, but in the best possible way. The BF and I stopped in for a late lunch last week, mostly because he had never been there. I ordered your basic gyro and he got the Souvlaki gyro, which is pork, I think. We also got the spinach pie to share. I really enjoyed mine. For me, their gyros are second only to St. Nicks Greek food festival. Both places have a fantastic gyro, which comes with a ton of meat, with an amazing tzatziki sauce, except compared to St. Nicks $8.00, Mike and Tony's is only for $5.50! Whatda bargin! The pork was a little fatty but spiced and cooked well, and with pork you get fat, so I can't really can't blame them for that. It was also a little more expense, but still totally worth it. The spinach pie was ""eh"" for me but I'm not into that too much. The only thing I think would put this place over the top would be some kick-ass hand cut fries. Alas, they have yucky frozen fries. I guess you can't be great at everything."
test_2587,I've been buying flowers from you for a few years. Very impressed with quality and customer service. Getting married in 3 days and will come to you.
test_2588,"I was happy to see a Panera open in my neighborhood because I've been carrying around a My Panera card that I can only use when I go back to St. Louis.  When I did live there Panera was my goto in the winter mainly for some quick, inexpensive comfort food, like a grilled cheese and a nice bowl of soup.  

Due to the hot temps here in AZ, I've looked for lighter options.  I've used the drive-thru only at this Panera 4 times and overall have had good experiences.  I've gotten bagels and iced green tea twice and also tried their Mediterranean veggie sandwich and the Roasted Turkey and Avocado BLT.  All have been very fresh and tasty and only one time they forgot the napkins, but I was headed home so it was no big deal.  

I feel for them and all the negative reviews.  This is a tough to please neighborhood with an inordinate number of people speeding around in their luxury SUVs acting like they are the only ones on the road, and the only ones in the restaurant.  If you don't cater to them you are in big trouble.  Hopefully this location can get their issues straightened out.  I know from the St. Louis perspective, Panera is a great corporate citizen which does a lot in the community and gives back to many charities that fight hunger.  I don't know if they are doing that here in AZ, but the next time I'm in I'm going to ask."
test_2589,Nice clean place . Bright and good vege options. The vege sushi platter was nice .  The host and servers were nice too.
test_2590,I stayed at the Venetian for our one year anniversary. From the moment I walked in I could tell at one point it lived up to its glory but has dated since then. I don't know where the $44 resort fee is going towards. The pool was small and all the spots filled up early in the morning. The room was beautiful but the lobby definitely needs some renovation. This is not a 5 star property.
test_2591,This place has awesome authentic street Mexican food. The location is perfect and the atmosphere inside is great for conversation and they have bands and happy hours as well.
test_2592,"I haven't been here in a VERY LONG TIME, and after dinner for a friends birthday I see why. She came for her birthday during the 50off sushi and boy the quality was very poor. And presentation was awful as well, but the service was ok. It was horrible that we had to wait until the ENTIRE party arrived, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. Like it made no sense! I won't be going back unless it's a birthday party for someone and if it is I'll order water. 

Not Pleased"
test_2593,Just went for my very first tattoo to celebrate my birthday. Awesome place. Luke was soooo good. Made me very comfortable. Great sense of humor. Inked such a gorgeous design from just telling him what I was thinking of. I highly recommend West Coast and will definitely go back in the future!!  Thanks Luke!!
test_2594,"These guys are great.  They are very clear on what needs to be done, and what can wait.  They are honest about their prices and are very willing to work with you to ensure that you are satisfied.  

It is clear that Virginia Auto Service cares about their customers and wants to fix your car the right way.  They are serious about the work, and they let you know that.  In fact, they have a 24 month / 24,000 mile warranty to cover all of the work they completed in the shop."
test_2595,This place is my absolute favorite! I live about 2 hours north but always find time to come down here to shop. I can always find clothes that fit me perfectly and I bring my own clothing to sell as well!
test_2596,"Most amazing and cheap place for great breakfast. Used to come here over 12 years ago when I was introduced to it as a TDSB student employee. The food has never left my mind. The western peameal omelette has been the same price and same great taste, even after 12 yrs of not tasting it! I was glad I was able to find this place again after forgetting it's location. Yeah, the place looks run down, but it's been around for 52 years with the humble and generous John leaving his doors open for the community. Hours are 6-10 am so get in before the doors shut. Rumour has it this may be his last year. Would be sad to see him go. $6 for a triple decker peameal and egg sandwich! Still blows my mind.  Hiiiiiighly recommended and I'm extremely critical of food joints."
test_2597,"From check in to finish this office has been fantastic. I was taken right on time and the staff was super friendly as was Dr. Kanarish. Very professional, knowledgable, answered all my questions. Definitely recommend this vet!"
test_2598,"Very nice hotel overall - the room was great - the bathroom was nice although the grout is old and a little dirty and the gold shower door hinge is rusty and makes a loud noise.  Parking is free as it should be, but unfortunately they have followed suit with the nickel and dime tactic and charge an additional $34.95/day ""resort fee"".  Much of the blackjack only paid 6:5.  The gondola ride was a big disappointment - $116 for a couple and the ride literally lasted about six minutes...you go down and then turn back - it's not even a big loop.  Don't recommend it!  The shops are nice inside and they also have a more frugal food court that includes Chipotle.  So close to being a great casino, but they need to step up the game and stop nickel and diming."
test_2599,"This property has totally turned around by new manager.  I am happy to say it is well managed.  Beautiful apartments.  Great pool and other amenities.  Great location- close to walks, bike trails and hikes at Tempe Town Lake, Papago Park and the Hayden wash.  Super central location close to the highway.  Easy access to the whole Phoenix metropolitan area.  We love living here.  No issues."
test_2600,"Cool bar decor...good food...cold beer.
Lets start with the negative.....i hate old town Scottsdale!
100 places to eat and drink with NO PARKING.
i do my best to steer clear of that $5 Corona tourist trap!

I had the burger with blue cheese, fried pickles and jam.....very delicious as were the seasoned fries.  11.00
Coors banquet bottled beer....love it!  4.00
My girl had the steak salad which was very good...13.00
9.00 margarita???  Ugh.....!"
test_2601,"Toast is awesome!  I am not sure I can say more than the other 98 reviews, except that go early on the weekend, because it is packed!"
test_2602,I went for happy hour and we had dinner at the bar. I had ravioli and a house salad which was fabulous. My friend had some sort of pasta with white sauce and shrimp tempura of which she said was really good. Had some great wine at happy hour prices and it was all fantastic. We also had great service on a Tuesday eve. Can't remember her name but she was great. Will be back very soon. Looking forward to a sit down dinner which was decorated so nicely in that area. If not dinner their wkd breakfast/brunch looked really good too. Nice to eat at a non gaming establishment.
test_2603,"Marathon Diner may not look fancy, but I had the best airport meal of my life here!  Skip the long line at McDonald's and head to Marathon for authentic, fresh, made-to-order Greek diner food.

The veggie gyro ($10) was filled with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and feta cheese.  So good, and I almost feel like it was healthy?!  The guy working at the griddle (possibly the owner?) was really nice about asking whether I wanted banana peppers, cheese, etc., so I'm sure they would accommodate special requests.  I love that Marathon offers a tasty and satisfying vegetarian option, because the cheese pizza slices at Villa just looked sad! 

Obviously I was just here for dinner, but Marathon Diner serves breakfast too!  Definitely stop here if you are hungry in the Pittsburgh airport. You can really tell that they put a lot of love into the food!"
test_2604,"Really disappointed with this place. I love Nathan's and have had plenty of great experiences with them, however this location was not good. 
Probably a little naive of me to expect a quality hot dog in the MGM Grand.

The dog was rubbery and the bun was stale. I'd stick to the Nathan's in the Airport!"
test_2605,"My girlfriend and I were planning on going to a nice dinner on new years eve 2016, we had not yet decided which place we were going to go, We were leaning towards a local madison steakhouse, not that Flemings is not a great place, i had already eaten there before, but she got sick so i decided to get take out, flemings was the 4th or 5th place i called, i googled Madison's best steak houses and will tell you, that 4 of them were completely rude and were put off that i even asked if they would do take out, and place was so snobby and said we do not do take out let alone on new years eve, but i got a hold of a very nice lady at flemings who was very pleasant and said of course we will do carry out it just might take a little extra time, but they were very polite and the food was great, they were just as busy as these stuck up local steakhouse who acted like they could care less about one customer. Thank You to the staff at Flemings for making our evening great even though we could not go out anywhere we will defintely be back Thanks Jason"
test_2606,Great stand alone deli. The service was fast and friendly. Their bread is of course fresh accompanied with quality Boars Head meats and cheeses. You can't order a bad sandwich here but nothing that stands out either.  The prices are good and the portions are adequate. I wouldn't mind a meaty sandwich but honestly I always walk away full. Overall I would recommend if you want a good sub with quality ingredients.
test_2607,"This place is an Arizona classic. Will I am partial to their taco lunch special (yeah, I'm basic), their red chile is absolutely to die for. Great margaritas too. Always go with the top shelf, you won't regret it!"
test_2608,Out looking for new furniture we started at RC Willey. We looked at a few and most of the staff was friendly and didn't force themselves on us. Then one of the sales guys decided to sit was us on a sectional and continued following us for about four more units. I explained we were only looking but he kept pushing us to try and make a sale today. I had enough and exited the store. They do have a lot of nice merchandise but that really was the factor for me not to return.
test_2609,"As a Packer fan myself from Racine, WI, this is one of my favorite neighborhood establishments.  A wonderful menu of delicious entrees, karaoke, pool tables and of course the seasonal games.  This place can get unbelievably packed during the games so make sure you arrive early to get yourself a seat.  Go Packers!"
test_2610,"This place is great!  We came as a group of 5 on a Saturday night and had a fantastic time. 

If you are coming on Saturday, make sure you don't come before 9:30 and plan to spend the WHOLE night here.  For Saturday nights, it is a set menu (we paid $45 per person plus alcohol) and you get loads of excellent food and entertainment.

Around 10:00pm, they brought out a bunch of appetizers (excellent baba ghanoush, hummus, lebneh with mint, Shanklish (which is a middle eastern blue cheese type of cheese ball), tabouleh, Kibbeh nayyeh (which is raw meet so I was pretty skeptical about but was delicious) and lots of pita.  You can keep asking for more of any of these items.

Around 11:00pm a singer came out.  Although I couldn't understand what she was singing, she sounded good to me and people got up to dance which was fun.

Around midnight, they brought out the meat (chicken and beef kabobs and kafta).  By this time of course, you are STUFFED but I had a bit of everything and it was all pretty tasty.  I don't think you can ask for more meat but truthfully, I don't know how anyone could anyway.

Then, a belly dancer came out and I think she gave about a 30 minute show and it was really good.

After that they bring out Turkish coffee and some sort of cheese dessert.  Then the singer came on again and sang until closing.

We stayed until 3:00am.  I would definitely recommend going to this place!  I'm not from a Middle Eastern background and it was a really great way to experience their food and culture.  I was with people who are originally from the Middle East and they all loved it and said it reminded them of home which I think is a pretty good recommendation!"
test_2611,My wife and I came back last week Friday bringing our 15yo grandaughter. The place was again not crowed but that isn't unusual for Scottsdale when high school football is in season. Parking this time was good we were only a few steps away from the door.  We were seated instantly at the same table as last time.  Gil came over and chatted with us. Gil mentioned that we should park in the back alley and come in that way next time. (He reads the reviews). We order more extensively this time as we trusted how the food would be.  Again excellent excellent.is the best way to describe Indian food done correctly.  We again ordered medium with hot sauce on the side so we could bring it up to the level each of us liked individually. Gil's wife was there and we chatted and found out she was also originally from N. Cal.  If you like real Indian food done perfectly this is the place for you..  Again we ordered additional food to go so I could have it another day.
test_2612,"Oh? Another patbingsu review? This one was better than the one I had two years ago. That's for sure. They're doing proper shaved ice now. The milky kind. We got the green tea one today for $8.80 plus tax, and while it wasn't very big, especially shared between three people, it was quite tasty. They put the matcha powder in with the milk mix, so the shaved ice was actually matcha flavored. They then put a good amount of red beans and condensed milk on top, then added a few bits of mochi. Without the condensed milk, it could have been a bit sweeter, but with it, it was just about right. While this isn't going to be my go-to patbingsu place, I'm still thankful for a place close to home where I can get my shaved ice cravings satisfied."
test_2613,"I really enjoyed this little gem.  Great beer and great food in a great atmosphere.  Very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable staff.  None of the food here has ever disappointed.  I especially love the mac 'n' cheese."
test_2614,"I've been enjoying Vias since I was a little girl, 25+ years. Of all the Mexican Restaurants in the valley that I've tried,  It's my favorite. Great food, prices, and service!"
test_2615,"Ew. Don't go here, I like found like a weird like bug? In my chicken? I thought it was just a big piece of pepper? Btw it wasn't. I used to love McDonald's, but now I only go every day instead of twice a day because of this mishap. I also found out that their chicken is F.A.K.E! That spells fake.. like me"
test_2616,"Don't come after 10pm even though they close at 10:30. They won't make you any rolls and the line is bare!! As ive been coming here recently, the quality has degraded and the service is horrible, regardless of time of day. i used to love this place but not so much anymore."
test_2617,Fast and efficient.  THe shuttle was quick to take us to the destination.  I was surprised at how far the rental car place is from the airport but we got there quickly.  The shuttle on the way back to the airport was quick as well.  We rented through Budget and were in and out within about 10 minutes.  The return process was a breeze.
test_2618,"Went to IHOP with the family for a late night dessert. When we got there, the waiter went to seat us but the table he was seating us at had a sleeping kid on the seat. He had to seat is in a location that was towards the back that was empty. We were given menus but the waiter didn't come back to take our order for at least 15 minutes. We thought he forgot about us. So I stood up so he could see me when he passed by. When we ordered, we asked for a sundae and we were informed that there was no ice cream. So we ordered something else from the menu. I felt something crawling by my foot. Looked down and there was a HUGE cockroach. My son squashed it with a napkin (see picture). The food came out within a reasonable amount of time but the waiter didn't come back to check on us. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes but he never came by so we went up to the front to see if we could get his attention and pay. There was a group of 6 people there waiting to be seated. They had been there 10 minutes and hadn't been seated. When the waiter finally came out, he asked how everything was. We told him about the cockroach and he said ""I'll tell my manager"". Definitely not the response I expected. This was a horrible experience all around. I wouldn't recommend this place. They don't seem to care about customer service at all."
test_2619,"I came here with my daughter on May 7th 2014 and then again on May 21st 2014. On the 21st, I was waiting for my daughter to be finished with her nail drying and as I was waiting, I noticed their inspection review posted on the wall. I began reading it and every technician was red flagged. Every single one. The inspector had so much to write about he/she wrote all the faults and flags in between preprinted words, around the outsides of the page, and on the back. For each tech under the comment field, he/she had to write so small about all their short-comings that it was very difficult to read. From what I gathered, it was mostly how each tech wasnt cleaning their tools properly, unsanitary, bacteria found.  The date for the inspection was May 8th 2014. The one line that stuck with me was ""not a single bottle of disinfectant/tsa or liners throughout the entire salon nor at any nail stations"". When I was finished reading, I turned around and found that management the receptionist and a few other techs were watching me. I asked when their next inspection will be, and they said ""no need, we passed"". I said, ""according to this, clearly not"". I got a shrug of the shoulder and a back to my face. When I paid, I didnt offer a tip, and the receptionist asked me if I was going too, I informed her that I shouldnt be paying for anything,  but because I didnt come in here to get something for free nor an infection or worse HEP C, I certainly wont be giving a tip. Needless to say, I wont be going back. IMHO."
test_2620,"First time here. Very nice place and atmosphere.
The food is good, very different from other places around bloor st. i ordered fried chicken sammy, love the bun! It's so crispy. My friend tried the rotisserie chicken, it's so tasty even without the sauce.
Definitely will come back!"
test_2621,"Great food. Nice service. Make sure you go very hungry, because besides being good food, is massive. Specially the omelets. 
The decor looks like a strip club, but it didn't bother me, made me feel at home."
test_2622,"Three stars is for the flavor of the food. Unfortunately it wasn't well executed. So for execution I'd give it more like 2 stars.  The drinks took so long that the food had arrived before we got them.  But the food wasn't what we ordered unfortunately. The waiter was very nice and he fixed it as quickly as he could.  But even then the execution wasn't great. The turkey panini was flat grilled on dry bread so it crumbled as you picked it up.  The flavor of the bruschetta was good but again the execution made it hard to eat. The bread was sliced but the toppings were put on after.  Standard flatware isn't sharp enough to cut through prosciutto so I destroyed it trying to serve it to my table mates.  

So generally we were treated well and liked the food but the execution just wasn't really good enough to bring us back again."
test_2623,Seriously yummalicious baked goods! Huge sandwiches. The corned beef can be a little dry. The best mazoh ball soup in Vegas. Good smoked fish. This is the best Jewish deli in Vegas.
test_2624,"Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy, wine list is weak, and seafood is only barely competently prepared. 

Calamari was good. Worth it, served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo. 

Lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best, and ""crusted with pecans""=sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum. 

The day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings."
test_2625,"A pretty long wait for very average food.  The meal sizes were very big, but overall the taste was bland."
test_2626,"Filthy filthy
The floors haven't been vacuumed in days
The back room visible is filth they didn't offer water but I would not have taken it
My Fingers still hurt 7 hours late
The uv actually stung my fingers...I mean hurt

test_2627,"My husband and I moved from Florida to Mesa and we had a lot of trouble with getting our accounts transferred. The only person willing to put in the effort to make things right was Melissa. She dealt with both my husband and I in person and through numerous phone calls. Every time she did not have an answer for us, she called us back in a reasonable time frame, even if the update was she was still working on it. Really grateful to work with a reliable and honest employee who shows us that she cares about us. Melissa has helped make the problems that occurred go away and honestly, the only reason we still are State Farm customers."
test_2628,"My biggest regret about my visit here is that I didn't find out the significance of ""1847"".

Overall the experience was very good. The atmosphere and decor is really nice and the staff are friendly, attentive and talkative. The atmosphere flirts with being relaxed and casual but with a classic wine bar feel.

We started our meal by sharing the Poutine which caught my eye because it was made using a port jus and thyme. The combo worked extremely well and I'd definitely go back for this dish alone. Elsewhere in the group, there was the house salad served with a shallot vinaigrette which, I am told, was also good.

For the main a couple in our group ordered the Veggie Wellington which stole the show. It was served with carrots. My girlfriend ordered the salmon with a risotto which was pretty good. I ordered the butter chicken. I eat a lot of curry and I have to say I didn't really enjoy it. It was served with bok choi and red pepper (both weird choices in my opinion) and overall the dish lacked a bit of flavour which is unforgivable for an Indian dish. I wouldn't order this on a repeat visit.

For desert we ordered the chocolate and orange creme br√ªl√©e which finished off the evening nicely.

Overall I would definitely go back."
test_2629,"The store has a nice men's department downstairs.     The sale items are all the way in the back near the dressing rooms, check it out for great deals....

The salespeople are friendly and helpful.    This store has a great coffee shop right by the men's department...where you can get a drink and a pastry.   Comfy seating makes it for a great little coffee spot.

Club Monaco is a bit on the pricey side, but I usually find great sales that are a great value.."
test_2630,It is what it is.  The staff seems knowledgeable and pleasant.  Prices & selections aren't bad.  I get my racquets re-strung there.
test_2631,"Very clean, very friendly employees, and everything is top of the line quality. I got a spray tan done (level 2) and it turned out very nice and natural looking. Not to mention, I only paid 22$ for it! Give this place a shot you won't be disappointed:)"
test_2632,"I was really hesitant to come here, because I have no idea why. Its near my house and I miss these type of spots from home and I guess I was afraid of being disappointed. 

I reluctantly ordered. Side eyeing everything haha. 
Well by the time I walked out I am a Camille addict. 
And I hadnt even tasted a bite of food. 

The customer service from the tall gentleman was stellar. My bf were taking our food to go and although it looks Im sure why but off putting tucked into the plaza it is really pleasant and cozy inside. And they have a drive thru.

I came back the next day for more.

The rose macaroons are incredible. The sandwiches are incredible. The soup is incredible. 
I am a huge fan of the almond croissant. 

The coffee is really really good and they always have decaf. I beg you to try Camille. 

Next time I go I wouldnt even mind waiting in line. 
Supporting these places is really easy at these prices. 
It would be lovely to have an afternoon tea party catered by them or a birthday for a little lady. 
Im really obsessed."
test_2633,"If you are like me, you buy books or bring in books and study at the coffee shop. I have been to many Barnes and Noble locations but this one was extremely loud. If you are looking for a book to buy or a place to hang out come here! If you are planning to study or read, don't!"
test_2634,My husband and I came here and it was very busy because of the baseball game but cleared out very quickly when the game started. My mixed drinks were so delicious. Our food was typical bar food. Our waitress was super great and attentive.
test_2635,"We've been staying here since they opened and are never disappointed. From the valet, bell-person, check-in, housekeeping...well, everyone is polite, helpful and respectful. The rooms are always clean and now with the newly remodeled decor, very current and upscale. We spend our days at the pool in the summer months and there are many options. They've got a beach entrance that's great for kids and a Baja shelf side to put a chair in the water, an adult pool and the regular pool that's 4 1/2' deep. Hot tub, of course. It's hard to find a nicer pool and staff at any hotel. The food at the pool is waaaay above average for most restaurants, much less ""pool food."" Plated like fine dining. Highly recommend the Seaside Salad! Had it 2 days in a row! Fruit platter is fabulous with a huge variety. Hank's Steaks has hands down the BEST martinis! From 4 to 7 in the bar they're half price and they DON'T cheat the alcohol! So many to choose from, you must try 2! They're service is first rate! This hotel has made a transformation like most have. Service has been stepped up and the quality of restaurants/services has improved over the last 10 years. This is and will be one of our ""go to"" hotels."
test_2636,"This is an amazing local restaurant. I love the menu style and the atmosphere. I have had the chicken parm on multiple occassions and it is wonderful.

This is not a high end restaurant it is local flair. Excellent value and good food."
test_2637,"I wasn't expecting a very good show but i thought it would be fun so I went. I was very surprised how funny the show was. I couldn't stop laughing. They take actual volunteers form the audience. There isn't any nudity in the show, so don't be scared to go up. They keep the people up there that are easier to hypnotize. It is a more vulgar show but if that doesn't bother you. i would highly recomend it."
test_2638,"We celebrated my grandsons' graduation from ASU this week.  This place has great food and drink and it also has character and history.  My grandson was impressed that they had a congratulatory card on the reserved table signed by the entire staff.  We did not want to leave and in fact, we were the last ones to leave Lon's.    We explored the inn after dinner and all agreed that this was a night to remember.   Even though we live in the Chicagoland area, we will definitely return to this enchanting place.  We will also spread the word."
test_2639,"Honestly not sure why the reviews are so low! I've been here once before for happy hour and after hearing about their ""Brunch Happy Hour"" from open to noon on the weekend, I was excited to visit again. Basically all their brunch entrees are $8 including eggs benny, avocado toast, etc. It was a really great deal and the portions were big. I love brunch but I don't always love the wait and the price points at other restaurants. I wasn't expecting a lot but I was impressed!

I ordered the Chorizo & Mushroom hash which came with some avocado, topped with 2 soft poached eggs and a generous helping of hollandaise sauce. In terms of hollandaise it's a bit on the tangier side. Definitely a very rich dish, and very yummy! A friend of mine had the ""Super Avocado Brunch"" and enjoyed it as well. They have plenty of seating and are conveniently located across the street from The Core."
test_2640,"I worked with Kate all the way from Oregon for one year prior to my wedding day. I cannot express how thankful and lucky I was to find her and Sip & Twirl. I interviewed many wedding planners prior to hiring S&T, and once I talked with Laurie and Kate I knew immediately they were a perfect match for us. Kate and Laurie are down to earth, fun to work with, and work around the clock to ensure your day is perfect and exactly what you envisioned. Without Kate's expertise, I would not have been able to find such an amazing vendor team.  She was always one step ahead of me in the planning process and organized everything from the budget, vendor payments, and precise timeline and itinerary on the day of the wedding. My family was able to enjoy the day (and year prior!) knowing that all the details were in good hands. The whole year and day of could not have run any smoother. Everyone says that S&T was their best decision they made, and I totally understand why now...thank you thank you thank you!

test_2641,"This is my very first Yelp review and I'm writing it to save others the experience I just had. I just ate at Teharu for the first time. Everything was going well, the sushi was pretty decent considering their awesomely cheap prices. The service wasn't the best for sure but my boyfriend and I were totally enjoying the experience....UNTIL....a nasty cockroach crawled right up the wall in front of me and made its way onto a ceramic jar sitting on the counter in the kitchen. No one noticed it, not even when the sushi chef stood in front of it to wash his hands. It crawled in and out of the jar and all over the counter top. My boyfriend and I took pictures of it and still no one noticed. Since our appetites were completely gone at that point (there was no way were going to finish the rest of our sushi) we asked for a manager. There was no manager working so I asked for a supervisor. A lady came to us and asked us what we needed. When we told her she just walked away from us and told another employee to come talk to us. He came over and I told him what happened and he just said, ""Oh, really?"" So they gave us our check, we paid, and that was the end of it. There was no apology or anything. It was disgusting to say the least. One would think that having a kitchen open in everyone's view would tend to be a little cleaner, but after closer inspection I noticed that the glass surrounding the kitchen was very nasty and obviously hadn't been cleaned in some time and I could only imagine what the floor looked like beyond the glass right where the roach came from. I wouldn't have even given them one star but I guess Yelp requires at least one star.

Take a look on Maricopa County's Environmental Services website regarding this restaurant. http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=217877&business=HARU%20SUSHI&address=9845%20%20%20S%20%20PRIEST%20DR&permitid=SG62199"
test_2642,"I don't think I am hipster enough for this restaurant.  I have never in my life seen so many beanies and large framed glasses.  That being said, the food is delicious even though I have no idea what I ate because I couldn't read anything on the menu.  It is really cool that they were able to make vegan Polish food taste so good.  I would definitely come back just because the food was delicious.  They also have lots of different Polish beers on tap."
test_2643,"Returned again after a long wait. Sat at the bar just to be ignored by the bartender. Gerry i think his name was. Sat there over 20 minutes before ordering a beer, finally got the beer 10 minutes after that. Maybe 6 people sitting at the bar. It was a tuesday night for christs sake. Not busy at all. Worst service ever. Will remember to drive an extra 20 minutes to go to gilbert. They know good service. Pathetic."
test_2644,"This fod is pretty good - I recommend the crab cake sandwich or the cajun sausage sandwich.  If you're not concerned about calories, they do a really good job with their fries.  The service is unpredictable - sometimes it's better on the patio."
test_2645,"This place was amazing! Super phenomenal customer service, nice atmosphere, and good food!

First, I'll talk about the pizza. They were able to split the two we wanted into one pie! Yay! We got buffalo chicken and meat lovers. Both were delish and they were not timid with toppings. The buffalo chicken pizza had a great buffalo sauce on it. The meat lovers has pastrami on it! 

The wings were super crispy, but not overly greasy. They gave the medium sauce on the side, so that you could pour it yourself or use it as a dip. This is the 1st place I have been to that does that.

The garlic knots were good also. Lots of oil or butter at the bottom, but whatever makes it taste yummy, right?! Ha! I think these could have had more garlic on them, but we still ate them all. 

I haven't tried the other stuff, so I'll be back!

I definitely recommend this place! I appreciate the hard work and pride people take in their restaurant and this spot shines!"
test_2646,Just bought a motorcycle and went in to look for some riding jeans. I went up to the parts department to see if they had the pants in a certain size that wasn't displayed on the floor. I spoke with Tom who told me they didn't have that brand/size in stock. He referred me to another set of similar jeans and even gave me a 50% discount since the jeans were going on sale soon. Definitely will be going back. Thanks Tom
test_2647,"We went to the Imperial restaurant for Saturday dim sum. Imperial restaurant is located on the sixth floor, but luckily there is an elevator. The restaurant was nicely decorated since it was recently opened. The restaurant was not very crowded when we there compared to other restaurants.

The dim sum dishes were pretty good in my opinion. We had the standard dishes like pork shiu mai and shrimp hai gow. They came in square Imperial bamboo steamers which was a nice touch. My mother was not very impressed with the food saying that the other restaurants dim sum dishes were better.

I thought that the service was pretty good since they took away our trays pretty good. But my mother was angry since they asked for a tip when she say paying the bill! Will we go back? Maybe, since there isn't that many dim sum restaurants in Montreal anymore."
test_2648,"I lived here for almost 3 years and can honestly say I liked living here. We moved in to a two bedroom two bathroom. The stove, refrigerator, washer, and dryer were in good condition after a year of living here the washer stopped working went to the office to tell the manager (back then it used to be Angie) I had a new washer in a week. Every time something would stop working they always came in less than a week to fix it. The maintain guys were always nice and respectful they would just go do they're job and they were gone.

Living here I never experienced anything bad like someone breaking in to my apartment or car I lived in apartment 2001 which is on the very front of the building but my sister in law used to live on the very back of the apartment complex and they did break into her apartment once and stoled a few items luckily she wasn't home when that happened. I don't know if living closer to the front makes it a little safer. I would see cops constantly go around the apartment complex during the day and night so that gave me peace of mind. 

I wanna say for the first 8 months I never saw a cockroach which made me very happy and I was pleasantly surprised. The neighbor next to us got evicted for not paying rent and that's when the problem with the cockroaches started. I started seeing them so I went to the office to complain about it and thats when I found out he was infested and of course they were going to all the other apartments. They send a guy so he can spray and he would come once every two weeks it got better but unfortunately I would see one once in a while but it was nothing bad. 

I purchased a lot of things online when I lived here and I never had any problems with my neighbors stealing them or the office every time they got delivered to the office my packages were there. I would forget that I ordered something and Geneva (she works in the office) would call me and let me know I had packages waiting for me.

The reason why I gave them 5 stars despise the little issues I came across is because I think they do everything they can to solve whatever issue you may have. No the apartment was not perfect but it was comfortable to live here and I liked it. Also before I moved out they were renovating the whole apartment complex so that means you will get a nicer apartment that I had. 

My favorite office lady was Geneva I'm not sure if I'm spelling her name correctly but she was always very professional, friendly and helpful if you live here and have issues go with her she does her best to solve your problems and if your planning to move here ask for her."

test_2650,"The breakfast is always good. The lunch and dinner items, not so much. They seem to always mess the orders up whether it's not adding items that you've requested or removing items from a sandwich. Overpriced for the quality of food you receive."
test_2651,"For people living on the opposite side of the globe, before the internet was so widespread, television movies news were the source of information and the additions in the bucket list came from there too :)

Ocean's 11 came in 2001, and in the end when everyone is just looking at the the Bellgaio fountain .. it was then when it became an addition to the bucket list .. and I bet not just mine.
Then internet became widespread .. very common .. and then everyone was off to vegas.
Me!! the first time I came to America, the very first time .. it was due to work; in Vegas :) .. I mean what better luck.

And without doubt .. the fountains of bellagio are one of those things which look even better in real life .. though off late things have become more flashy in reel life :P but not this one :) 
It is just a great feeling to be able to stand there, right on the rails and watch those fountains dance ..

No, you won't come to Vegas just to watch these fountains dance but if you are here I doubt if you would want to go past 'em without stopping :)
And some people would rather skip ""viva las vegas"" to take a pic with the bootys for instagram or whatever .. I would not :)"
test_2652,"Server was a little slow for the restaurant not being busy, but the food was incredible! Will definitely come here again!"
test_2653,"The receptionists at University Dental Health Services (UDHS) are terribly rude and unkind. Beth stands out as someone who is not warm or helpful with respect to patients, abruptly hanging up phone calls with an ""Uh-huh. Buh-bye."" It is truly disheartening that I dread calling to schedule an appointment or to ask questions due to the team that is the front-line representatives of this practice. That being said, the clinical staff at UDHS is truly excellent. I have been a patient for the past 3 years and have had basic cleanings performed and interacted with several different dental hygienists. All have been extremely friendly and polite. The wait time is typically between 10 and 15 minutes. The dentists are also wonderful. Dr. Christine Wankiiri-Hale is exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable. Overall, I do not recommend coming to this establishment for a stellar customer service experience. Otherwise, I recommend their clinical expertise."
test_2654,"Let me start with saying the service was excellent.  It did take longer than I think it should have to get seated by the hostess for it not to be crowded. But not a crazy wait and they were nice.  
I had the Original Smash Burger and my friend had the Tatted Turkey Burger.  The meat patties are larger than the bun. They also come with assorted french fries which I love.  My burger was delicious however if I order a burger again I would order it Medium as all burgers are made medium well. I wish my burger had more bbq sauce on it, however I devoured it so fast I didn't have time to ask for an extra side.  The turkey burger was good as well but not as good as the the smash burger.
The portions are healthy so unless you are with a group it is hard to even want to order and appetizer.
We shared the fried ice cream sundae.  A terrific idea, since I love deep fried ice cream and think the best one comes from El Torito when they use chocolate chip ice cream.  The idea was good execution poor.  It comes with a side of caramel syrup, chocolate syrup, whipped cream, bananas and peanut butter, pineapple, and strawberries.  All the sides were great it was just the fried shell was not up to par.  The cornflakes were bland and seemed stale tasting.  Maybe needing to be fried longer or something.  It just wasn't what I hoped for.  Regardless my inner fatboy still devoured it.
I would definitely come back I want to try the Triple T fries along with some other dishes.  
You can also use your Total Rewards Card to pay for your bill so that was great all I had to do was leave the tip."
test_2655,"I have ordered albos 3 times while visiting Las Vegas. The food is affordable and tasty. That said the people on the phone don't seem to understand what people expect out of a cashier at a delivery place. The person seemed more interested in making me laugh than making sure my order was right and they could deliver it. This time my delivery driver was kicked out of my hotel and I had to come to the entrance to get my food. If I wanted to walk through my hotel I wouldn't have ordered delivery, I would have gotten food from the food court.

The previous time I ordered they had no problem getting into our room but we discovered on the receipt had my ENTIRE CREDIT CARD NUMBER, EXPIRATION DATE, CC2 CODE, AND ZIP  WRITTEN ON THE RECEIPT. The driver kept a copy. This is completely unacceptable as it invites identity theft. 

The person answering the phone also seems very distracted and set the phone down twice (for 5 min or so each time) to take an order from a customer in the store rather than taking the minute or two to finish our transaction or placing me on hold to deal with the in store customer. 

In short fast, cheap, food with a very poor execution."
test_2656,"I saw this shop when we went to Universal last month but didn't stop in though. So, when I saw this store today at the second level of the Fashion Show Mall in between Auntie Anne's and Borders (closing BTW), we checked out the Sanuk line- very impressive large selection of these flip flops BTW (makes these ones called Yoga Mats for the ladies, which are so pillowy and comfy- love the way they feel, and they come in so many fun colors and animal prints too BTW), because my husband is looking for the ones that say ""These Are Not Shoes"" without the backs (super hard to find; we've been searching), but there were only three pairs left,  which were not his size. The guy working there said that they won't be in for another three weeks (we'll have to check it out). There was another lady working there too BTW. They were very nice too.  

Small store but good use of space- most of the wall space was utilized. It was neat and didn't seem crowded, which usually tends to be the case with small stores. But then again there was only one other customer besides us.   

Great store for the flip flop fan- even in Winter, these flip flops are here to stay, as witnessed everywhere we go (whatever floats your boat). I am very picky with mine, because I need some support for my high arches. But I do highly recommend the Sanuk Yoga Mats for the ladies; sold here for $32; might be higher for the animal prints. (Also available at Dillards, should this store not have your size in stock.)"
test_2657,Went in today before lunch to get some new nail supplies. I asked the manager of the store what I need for a beginners nail kit. He walked me through the store and told me what I needed. Iwould give it 5 stars if some of the prices were lower. But overall they have a great selection to choose from.They do host classes and give a student/ license discount. Best beauty supply in Vegas so far.
test_2658,"This is still the best soft serve I know, in the world. 

My favorite flavors are mint and cherry. Their flavors are subtle, mild, and the cream is not overly sweet. Lately, the ice cream I've had at other ice cream establishments has been so sweet that it's actually inspired this positive review. I once finished a quart of Sidney Dairy Barn ice cream, in an afternoon, by myself. At other places I'll only have a small cup and I'll feel sick and renounce ice cream for a month -- how depressing. 

I don't know what else they do differently, but the milk is fresh and the flavors are right. It's basically a stand in the middle of corn fields - at last that's how I remember it - and they're only open during the summer. I always go out of my way to come to Sidney Dairy Barn and it's always a trip worth taking.

P.S. CASH or CHECK only."
test_2659,"Was disappointed with the attitude and demeanour of the waitress. The quiet restaurant serves pretty good food, but overall I had a bad experience with the service and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends."
test_2660,This is our go to Chinese place. We went here all the time when we lived closer. Now we're a little ways away but we still make the trip out there when we get a craving for Chinese food. I just wish they were closer. Their Kung Pao chicken is the best.
test_2661,"I'm taking my time too write a review for ""Appliance Part's Center"" too .. Recognize publicly ""EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS""! Which I know personally is HARD TOO FIND especially living as a ""local"" in Las Vegas. My Husband and I purchased our new home. The previous Owner's were gracious enough too leave us a list... Of The Service Provider's they have used the whole 14 years' owning our now .. Current home. Our Freezer had been acting up. I went to their letter.. And called ""Appliance Part's Center"" and ""Francisco"" and another Gentleman arrived... Not just promptly.. But BEFORE our original scheduled time. He & His Partner.. We're very Courteous, Professional and I could tell  knew what they were doing. They completed the repair. Later, after running errands I didn't realize the ""issue"" was apparently not fixed. I called ""Francisco"" at 9:58pm. He told me "" I will be back in the morning"" when he arrived again...(before he was supposed too be here) I mentioned in a state of dismay "" All my food is going bad"" he was very calm.. And called his Brother ""Emillio"" and WITHIN.. Not even 10 minutes... Arrived with a ""loaner"" refrigerator! WOW!! What EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I coincidentally didn't end up using the ""Loaner"" Refrigerator.. I guess the problem was resolved. I wanted too do this review.. Because.. 
1) Too ""Publicly"" ACKNOWLEDGE.. excellent Customer Service People. Who generally ONLY HEAR NEGATIVE COMMENTS!
2) With Francisco & Emillio's EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE..I will NEVER GO ANYWHERE ELSE...
3) Will HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY too EVERYONE I COME ACROSS.. in need of having their Appliance's fixed!! 
Thank you FRANCISCO & EMILLIO... You two Brother's (whom are also Twins) ....
MAKE OUR WORLD A BETTER PLACE! I salute you both!!!

test_2662,"The hotel itself was pretty nice and in a good location. I felt the the valet parking staff was unprofessional and slovenly. Apparently, that are not employees of the hotel. That said hotel management should take greater care in selecting the staff that will be representing the hotel upon arrival. Even if you arrive or leave by cab or uber, you are subjected to their antics. The rooms themselves are very nice. However, if you like loud, thumping club music book a room on the 2nd floor. That way won't have to leave your room to enjoy it at 2AM rather than going downstairs to join the 5 other guests actually in the lounge.  Also, if you want change for a $20, don't ask at the front desk. They will refer you down three levels to the aforementioned valet parkers. I actually like the Aloft brand, but was disappointed with this stay."

test_2666,"I was in town on business and we were exhausted and starving. This place had good reviews so we gave it a go. We were blown away by how good everything was! The house seasoned wings were perfect, but the real star was the Irish Nachos. Reuben filling on top of hot waffle fries with Russian dressing? We still talk about how delicious they were. We're looking forward to visiting again the next time work brings me to Streetsboro."
test_2667,Worse Uhaul experience ever! I would never go to this uhaul ever again. Guy at the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful. It was my first time renting a truck at uhaul and he seemed annoyed with the questions I was asking. They clearly don't inspect their trucks. Gas needle was broken and we were told truck had a full tank of gas. We only drove 16 miles and we chose to fill up the tank because if not they charge 5 dollars a gallon!!!! I put 20 dollars of gas and the truck still needed more so it clearly did not have a full tank when we got it. When I explained what happened the guy at the counter (same guy from earlier) was very unhelpful and just told me to call his manager... it's the closest uhaul to my house but I would rather drive to a farther one than deal with them ever again!!!
test_2668,"Right off the plane and ready to eat some breakfast! 

My father lives in North Las Vegas and this restaurant is right up the road about 10 kinutes away so it was perfect.

We got in pretty early around 7 am and was sat right away, the atmosphere and interior is very woodsy and matches the name of the restaurant to the tee!

There was only 1 server working in the entire restaurant and she had maybe 2 current tables but she was a hustler and moved pretty quick around the restaurant with refills and food delivery.  I was surprised no manager was on the floor assisting.

The menu was fairly large and too much to scan so I went ahead and ordered the special that was posted out front Steak & Eggs for $9. Steal!

When the food was delivered I was very pleased with everything except for my steak. It looked to have been cooked only on one side, I ordered it to be Medium but when I got it and cut it open it was very rare, as if they just flopped it on for a bit and maybe even microwaved it. I was not impressed I decided to just try and eat some of it but could no longer bare it  so I let the server know and she went ahead and requested for a new one. The one thing that I will give them a fail at was instead of changing the entire plate out they cooked the same steak I had already eaten some of and re-cooked it and just added it to the same plate did not change the plate. I noticed it still had blood from the last plate so it was the same plate. 

Will probably give them a try again, my dad really likes the French Toast maybe I'll stick with the regular menu instead of the specials!"
test_2669,"Staff is so kind and friendly, pizza is amazing. Definitely in the top 5 pizza best places in AZ."
test_2670,"I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL! 

Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Don't be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this.

I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be.

When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change?

I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.  

Oh well..."
test_2671,"Everytime I'm in town I hit this place for curds, beer and brats. I spent a whole Sunday watching football here and had a blast. Crowded times are a little annoying, but it is a college place. Love the mustard selections too. Curds are a must!"

test_2673,"Giving this particular chipotles a 1 star because of their customer service . I go to this particular chipotle a lot because I work close to it. I ordered what I always order which is usually 5 bucks and the lady at the register named jalon told me 12 dollars . So I was like what? And she was trying to blame it on the guy that made my food when I saw him make it correctly. Plus she was trying to make me pay for a bottled water that comes with my meal because a drink comes with this meal and I have never been charged   For in the past . I order the same thing every time and am always charged the exact same until today. And she was arguing with me about it when I come here all the time , what happened to the customer always being right, no instead she basically accused me of lying about the price I am normally charged . I still like chipotle but customer service sucks at this particular location ."
test_2674,"Went there for lunch on July 12 on the 2 for 1 the hotel gave us.  Pizza was ok and ribs were pretty good.  Other than that nothing stood out.  Many things were edible, but not a lot of flavor including the pasta bar where they make it for you.  Go elsewhere this one is a dud!"
test_2675,"Ordered a decently large size to go order for ~10 people and the food was prepared accurately and on time for pick up.

Loved the Korean inspired hot dogs. I had the Gangnam Hot Dog (the one with pork belly) and it was delicious, would definitely have it again, although I also want to make my way through the menu to try the other hot dog options."
test_2676,"The fine print- I spent 5k for a new bed. The sales man made it clear the restock fee was 89$ if we were unhappy. He also sold us a king vs a Cal king after 3 weeks we loved the mattress but wanted to get the Cal king that we originally wanted. I was totally ok with the 89$ restock fee but fine print... the base will not fit the Cal king and they want 50% restock fee for it so 2000$  
They totally sold me on the King Vs Cal King and screwed me on the restock fee!!! Sales person omitted that information in conversation over return policy... but its in the fine pront"
test_2677,"I came here the other night to watch the Cavs game and was meh semi-impressed. They were serving up meatball sandwiches (which I guess is a thing they do on Tuesdays) and the server told us that Tuesdays are all day happy hour so that was kinda cool. 

About half-way through the game I realized our server hadn't come back at all. Did she leave? Did she not want a big tip from a group of 5 drinking copious amounts of beers? I'm still curious as to where she vanished to. Regardless, ended up having to go up to the bar to get more drinks..which was unfortunate seeing as there was hardly anyone in the bar.

Lastly, we all went up to the bar and paid individually when we were finished and it wasn't until I got home that I realized they charged me full price (what happened to the all day happy hour prices!?) for every beer I ordered. 

I really want to like this place because their beers were so tasty and Portside is so close to where I live! I'll be back for sure to give it another shot."
test_2678,"What an amazing atmosphere... Tough to find a good all round breakfast joint in all of Arizona let alone on this mountain... The Breakfast Joynt has it all... For starters great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice... I tried the French toast with Captain Crunch cereal on the outside.... Ummmm the bomb! Scrambled eggs were perfect and the whole toast tasted homemade... I don't think anything in this place could be bad... Last but not least the place is immaculate... Also seems like a family owned place that is HANDS ON and it shows! Definitely going to be my regular spot... (Haven't tried it for lunch yet, but definitely will real soon!)"
test_2679,"This is an ""okay"" buffet. Not as low quality as Circus Circus and Imperial Palace but not nearly as good as Rio. I would say eat here for breakfast but skip dinner."
test_2680,"I really wish I could get out to hear these guys more often. I suppose that means that the times I do attend a concert are just extra special these days. This review is based on my CPO concert-going experience spanning 16 years, with some specifics on the last two concerts I attended.

The CPO is truly one of the top orchestras in the country. The group has come a long way since its inception in 1955. Like all world-class orchestras, they offer the staples of concert series: Baroque (the Serenade Series), Classical and Pops. In more recent history, they have added a new music festival, a Tchaikovsky Festival and crowd-pleasing specials like Jeans &  Classics, Video Games Live, Bugs Bunny on Broadway and Star Trek. Their Saturday Morning at the Symphony Series is also quite popular.

I attended the Video Games Live 2.0 concert and one of the New Works performances in May. Their website provides a lot of information to help you make your purchase. The Box Office is extremely friendly, efficient and helpful when you need to contact them with a question or group ticket purchase.

The VGL 2.0 concert experience was a blast! They had gaming stations in the lobby, a costume contest, CD's, t-shirts, giveaways, and the Nintendo people were there. Even the Blindfolded Pianist of Youtube fame made an appearance. It was a huge celebration of gaming. Members of the audience came up to play Space Invaders and Guitar Hero. The orchestra played the music to match the players' progress (or lack thereof). 

In contrast, the New Works concert was a celebration of our Canadian composers. This was held at the Rozsa Centre. The group looked crowded on stage, but it somehow worked. I loved how the newest cellist waded his way to the front of the stage to make some opening remarks. There are a lot of new, fresh faces in the orchestra and they are giving the CPO a cool, hip vibe. 

That's a good thing. Yes, the orchestra needs to sound good, but to attract younger audiences, they also need to exude a bit of that ""coolness factor"", whether they're playing Bach, Brahms, Alan Gordon Bell or Bugs Bunny.

The artists came out to talk after each performance as well.

Those Hagen-Daaz bars are a great treat too.

Venues are top notch. The Jack Singer Concert Hall has wonderful acoustics. If you're going for sound, there isn't a bad seat in the house. If you want a good view, some seats are better than others. There is a good range of tickets, from dirt cheap to top of the line to meet any budget.

Seating is really good at the Rozsa Centre. It's a smaller facility but everything sounds and looks good in there. It's got a more intimate feel to it as well.

As for the ""front of house"" environment, they've recently made some updates in the lobby that make traffic flow smoother, but that's the EPCOR Centre's domain so I won't go more into that.

It's really cool that they have orchestra members interacting more with the public with things like SMATS, opening addresses and the Ask a Musician section on their website.

Berthold Auerbach once said that ""Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life."" Does the CPO deliver on this? Yes they do. They are a dedicated bunch and they play ""con molto espressione"".

[EDIT: To be absolutely honest, I worked @ CPO a very long time ago. It's been over 12 years ago and I don't know anyone there anymore so I trust that it's safe to review without any conflicts.]"
test_2681,"With all the hype, we came expecting good quality food. There was plenty of food but quality was all average. Nothing stood out but I enjoyed the creme br√ªl√©e only. I am trying to to see if there is any memorable dish but there was NONE.  I will not recommend this place."
test_2682,"The pesto was GREAT! The rest of the food was Meh and the service was the same. My girlfriend and I went here. We are both in our 20's. They seemed to not want to help us. We asked for ketchup when our food came and they didn't bring it for 20 minutes. We were finished eating at this point. 

If I ever go again, it would be for happy hour and pesto but I won't be buying more plates."
test_2683,Went here to eat yesterday night... Not having reservation makes it tuff to just go anyplace and eat but it's New Years Eve and I can understand.
test_2684,"I really wish we would have read reviews prior to booking with Advantage. Reservations were made over a week ago for a standard SUV. Pick up time at 8:30 pm. We arrive and they don't have the car we reserved. They can give us an upgrade to a mini van or larger SUV for $10 more. Then once my husband explains he isn't driving a mini van or paying $10 more for an ""upgrade"" and he wants it for the same price for the car we reserved they then tell him they do have a SUV BUT it needs to be cleaned and he along with my 3 year old daughter would have to wait for them to have it cleaned. Reservation was at 8:30, car is ""getting cleaned"" by about 9:30 and they finally get into the vehicle around 10pm. What is even the point of making a reservation for a certain car or time of the company can even honor it? The customer service with Advantage is terrible. I now see what they only have a 2 Star review. Try harder next time Advantage. Treat your customer better... ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH with the RESERVATIONS!"
test_2685,"I love Bulldog is back!   new place, new drinks but same old Ross!!!  Great to see the coffee master is back and better than ever!  And lots of new designs and pastry.    Don't leave again!!!"
test_2686,The staff are nice but management needs to get its act together. Lower level big neon sign pointing to cash checkouts that are all closed! Upstairs only 1 lane open except for self serve and we have hardly moved in 10 mins. Terrible and frustrating setup. And good luck finding an associate to help.
test_2687,"I was a little worried because of all of the negative reviews I saw on here, but you do learn a lot from all the negative reviews. Generally speaking, I get to learn at least the food items offered.

We arrived at 3:30 right at the transition from brunch/lunch to dinner.

All food was fresh and tasty. Nothing was really left untouched.

Sushi rolls were good for buffet

Smoked salmon was nice, plentiful, and just right temperature

Shrimp of course was yummy and not fishy

The cooked fish (both lunch and dinner varieties were delectable 

The desserts were plentiful in variety and small enough that allows you to try without looking like a glutton.

I'm glad this was my first Vegas buffet experience, because my second trip to a different buffet with much better yelp ratings was horrible, more expensive, and just really truly the pits!!

Good one, hats off to the grand buffet."
test_2688,I love this place!! We've been going here since the transition from the old to the new owners. They have an  amazing selection and will gladly order something for you. And the food... don't get me started on the food. It is amazing!!! Some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Their prices are very reasonable and the lunch specials come with a ton of food. They are incredibly friendly and generous and truly love their customers.
test_2689,Healthy and refreshing.  The beet appetizer was to die for!  Did not leave the restaurant feeling like I ate too much.   The portions were just right. The only negative comment was the noise level.  It felt like a noisy cafeteria.  We skipped dessert to get out of the din.
test_2690,"Bring cleaning supplies if you are going to eat in. Food is good, like any other South St. However the cleanliness is lacking. I wiped the crumbs off the cleanest looking table and its chairs. The table top was still a bit sticky. Next time I'll bring some water and vinegar solution. :-/"
test_2691,"Wow!! Rough! And seconds after you pay CASh only they force you off the pedi chair - NO PAMPERINg there lol - do yourself a huge favor and find somewhere else - mostly males who are rough on you. What a disappointment!!! Please don't spend your money where they are so very un- generous. The owner, he is not gracious. Support somewhere led by someone who cares for you while taking cash only."
test_2692,"Yes. Yes! Yes yes yes yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes.   Go. Go now. 

Cirque du Soleil's The Beatles LOVE is Enlightenment in a theatre. Brilliant everything. A plus. 11 out of 10. You get the picture.

Incredible from start to finish. Pure perfection. 

I will see this more than once. And I have seen many different Cirque shows to compare."
test_2693,Excellent food!!! Great variety... had delicious matzoh Brie....definitely try this place out...
test_2694,"Suzi is is amazing, she is doing more than massage she is changing lives. Since going to Zingara my life and chronic pain issues, have changed so much I feel like a different person. If you are looking to improve your health, deal with chronic pain and just get some relief from overused tight muscles, then Zingara is the place for you!!"
test_2695,"Thank you Aaron for your prompt response and awesome job with my cooktop repair! I completely short-circuited the ignition switch and needed to replace it ASAP. Called and Aaron was able to fit me in today within just a few hours. I can't thank you enough for your quick response time. Also appreciate you giving me honest feedback on what parts needed to be replaced.  Reasonable, fair and quick response time. I will definitely be using you again! Thank you!"
test_2696,"I have been a long time customer here. Ordered a very pricey birthday cake. It was so disappointing. The wrong color!! When complained they said u can bring it back for a refund, which now leaves us with no cake. Then few minutes they call back to say no u can't get a refund, there is nothing we can do!! Nothing to try to remedy the situation.  Awful awful customer service.  It's obvious they do not care  at all.  U lost a long time customer and we will for sure let others know if our treatment here. Shame on u Baker Wee. ....per your response Baker Wee it's obvious u don't strive for100% satisfaction otherwise u would have tried to accommodate or at least attempt to satisfy the customer. It was never  said "" it's perfect "" when the cake was picked up. When calling to discuss my dismay I was told , ""there is nothing we can do"" , period. I would have had more respect as a business if an attempt was made for some bit of satisfaction. Very disappointed."
test_2697,Excellent service and food. I got the Vanilla Bean Custard w/ Strawberries crepe. They are on top of their game. I love crepe bars in NYC and San Fran. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves crepes and great coffee.
test_2698,"Where do I even start? The owner/manager whatever she was, was the rudest woman I've ever encountered. She berated her employees and gave the place an air of stress, tension and  unease. Joey, who was the brunt of most of her meanness was the kindness guy, so funny and nice. The restaurant itself was dirty, smelled funny and had bad service. The food was not that great but the chef did a good job. The waitress was nice but came off as flustered and overwhelmed. We did teppanyaki ate and paid. When we got to the car someone came out and said that we'd been over charged and they'd overhead them say that we'd paid for everyone at the table. I went back in and waited my turn all the while listening to the owner run around yelling at her employees. When they got to us it turned out we'd been charged correctly after all but she yelled at the employees anyway.  The evening ended with me literally yelling at the owner to be nice. Horrible experience."
test_2699,My boyfriend and I came back for the second time tonight. And our service was just as fantastic as last time ! And I honestly believe it's because we were lucky enough to have the same server both times ! Her name is Cassandra and she has won us over. The food is great and affordable ! She suggested dessert but we were too full ! (Never a bad problem to have) we will be back ! And most definitely will ask for her by name.
test_2700,"I've been coming here for a year now. My most recent haircut generated rave reviews from co-workers. This place is a great find. Thanks, Yelp and fellow reviewers!"
test_2701,"I love this place. Everytime I come to Vegas, my friends and I will always watch the watershow before it shuts off for the night. 

Night time is better."
test_2702,"I've seen this show twice now and I loved it both times. If you haven't seen it, it's well worth it. Any seat is good but the experience will be different in different spots."
test_2703,"This easy moderate trail has more  gradual inclines compared to the end of Telegraph trail on South Mountain, which I prefer.   Flat and wider paths makes Pima Wash dog friendly, which we saw many of yesterday.  From one of the peaks you can see west of downtown PHX to south of Chandler.  Nice photo ops all along the way!"
test_2704,Found this place by accident considering it is a little hidden! Food was awesome and have no complaints! Great all around!
test_2705,"Great service! Quick, fast, and efficient. Best price in the area to remove my old couch. Highly recommended for anyone who needs some old junk removed."
test_2706,"I have such a love hate relationship with this place mostly because everyone wants to go which correlates to long lineups and sometimes just not bothering to go at all. I have tried two times prior to my third visit before I actually got in and I got in twice in two weeks, once on a Friday and the next on a Saturday night.

I really wanted to check out this place due to the fact it used to be the old Warehouse and I wanted to see how much it has changed. In fact, I was so blown away about how different everything looks now. I can tell there was a lot of money that went into the renovations of this building.

The main entrance leads to the a more loungey area with tables and seats while the upstairs boasts a nice dance floor with several booths on the sides. The main dance area has bars on both sides of the floor, perfect, so if you pick a side to hang out on you're just there and don't need to cross the floor full of people to grab a drink.

The MUSIC. The DJ's here are the DJ's from HiFi I do believe and they are pretty damn awesome. I have to shout out Vintage Saturdays because they play an eccentric collection of old school hip hop jams as well as a mixture of electronic dance music as well. If you go downstairs you can hear a crazy blend of old school pop tunes.

This place I could goto all the time and it would be even better if I could goto this place after 11 and still get in but unfortunately my quick tip would be to show up between 9:30 and 10:00pm or else GOOD LUCK CHUCK."
test_2707,"All the Boyd properties have really good buffets, you won't go wrong eating at any of them. Well worth the price, and one of the only buffets that will serve white rice (which is a staple for the hubs). 

Great service and a good variety of choices. We went for breakfast, so there were the normal breakfast meats, biscuits and gravy, waffles, and breakfast cereals. Keep in mind that they clear out the dining room before changing out the food, so you might have a time limit if you are in between meals. We went at 10am and were told lunch is served at 11, so the dining room is cleared out at 1045. No problem, in and out with a full belly."
test_2708,"Not a bad location, being right next to a handful of different types of food (fast food, bar food, pizza joints) and being 15 min.  to the airport was also a major plus.    

the rooms were typical, of an extended stay (kitchen, ""living room"" and bedroom combo) but I must say that the walls are a bit thin.    When you're at an extended stay, you're there for - well, an extended period of time!   So you get to meet those next to you several times .  And on this particular trip, I may have gotten a little more familiar than I wanted (and not by choice) .  Damn those thin walls...   but you got to love a couple in love...

Comfy beds, nice staff, good location."
test_2709,I will say I had instant regret booking a stay here because I saw the reviews after so I expected the worst but I was more than satisfied! Overall it was a great stay. Staff was very friendly & accommodating. They're definitely renovating at the moment but hey can't be mad at it. Some of the furniture is a little worn down but the room was very clean itself. I think that the people who rated this place low are probably picky & are bothered by small things. I did find somethings I could complain about but it honestly wasn't a big deal. I wouldn't really recommend families this is more of a spot you go to with friends.
test_2710,Absolutely love these guys. I used to go to envy when they were there on s highland years ago and have been a favorite ever since! Best in the burgh .
test_2711,"Why would I ever return?    (I know this is long, but laugh and cry with me.)  We have been here several times and were reasonably satisfied, and thus, I did not understand all the criticisms.  Now, I understand!  

We made reservations, three weeks early, with one of the mangers for an outside table on July 3rd (and we also confirmed them twice).  We asked for a table so we could watch the fireworks in Cave Creek that night.  Knowing that it would be crowded, we arrived early for our reservation but found no outside tables were available because all outside view tables were occupied by ""walk-ins"" who had long ago finished eating and were camped out for the evening.  We found the same manager who made our reservation.  He acknowledged our reservation, and then said ""I remember it because you were the first to make a reservation for tonight.""  OK, here is now rough outline of our evening.

* My first proposed solution was to ask the table occupants who had finished dining to leave the table because a reservation was pending for it.  He said he could not do that.  I have often been told when I have walked into a restaurant early that I must leave the table before a pending reservation arrived.  I am not sure why this would not work.
* His counter was that we wait for a table to open up inside, but then we would not be able to view the fireworks.
* My next solution was to rearrange some tables on the outside deck to make room for our party, but he said he could not do that because of fire regulations.
* By this time, the rest of our party found room at a table set up in their parking lot.  They said they would be happy sitting there.  However, the manager said he could not serve us from the menu in this area because he did not have enough servers.  However, we could purchase a ticket from the bar server outside and get a choice of three sandwiches and a small, individual bag of potato chips.
* When we decided that we were getting hungry and would eat the sandwiches, he, then, offered us an outside deck table in the rear of the building where we had no view.  We decided to stay in the parking lot.
* When we ordered, only two choices remained available and only one lunch-sized bag of chips.
* So our dinner consisted of luke-warm bratwursts on cold pretzel rolls, no kraut or pickles, but we did get mustard (okay ... we helped ourselves to that out of a large jar) and the one small bag of potato chips for the six of us.
* The manager never apologized, offered a discount on return, or offered to give us a round of drinks.  In sum, his attitude was ""tough @#@#.""
* On the plus side, the fireworks were great, Thank you, Harold's!

When the Tap Haus opened, we were excited because a seemingly unique restaurant would be available.  Added to our positive expectations was the fact that the owner of the good and very popular Hideaway was a joint participant in this venture. After my experiences, my advice to him is to cut his losses and close this place now ... or at least find new managers!  It's doomed without a complete overhaul.  They have also just changed the menu to a German theme which in my opinion will fall flat in this location.  Stick with the idea of a ""craft beer"" pub offering ""pub grub"" casual-style food. They tout a new chef and my advice to him is leave as quickly as possible.  Your up front staff will doom you.

Now, after writing this, I have discovered why I may return.  Unlike other reviewers, I found the beer cold this night.  So, I may return to have a good beer and bid the business a fond farewell.  Maybe the next, and fourth, venture in this building will succeed.

P.S.  The next day we were at a 4th of July get-together along with some of our group from the night before.  I happened to overhear one member of our party describe our experience as one of the worst she has had.  She saw me and was embarrassed ... so was I that we had invited them to such a poor choice of a restaurant."
test_2712,"Came here out of convenience...


Pharmacy had me wait 30 minutes told me my prescription was 80 went to pick it up and it was magically $130 


Misinforming patients and showed no concern for their lack of knowledge, stick to the real pharmacies not a company trying to maximize income"
test_2713,"Joe at A Arrow Alignment
Is AWESOME. Quick, efficient, and honest. I would highly recommend him to anyone that needs an alignment and they are not here to rip you off and I appreciate that in today's world!!!"
test_2714,Why have i not tried this place sooner? Went in today after Chilis and I usually go to Uswirl 3-4 times a week. This is my new favorite. A little mom and pop place we were greeted right away. Flavors were deeeelish I got Vanilla cake batter and chocolate. Whoa. The best part-homemade toppings!!! They were in little croc pot type dishes and I about died for the peanut chocolate one. Little tables and very homey. PLUS a military discount and punch cards. Im in.
test_2715,"I visited Beso a couple of weeks ago for my 12th 21st birthday and I can honestly say that it was one of the best meals I've had ever! One waiter almost ruined my experience but another server went above and beyond to remedy the situation so I it evened things out in the end.

My hubby and I had a 10:30 p.m. reservation since we were going to go to Eve afterwards. We were seated at the rear of the restaurant, which was nice, next to the large windows. Our initial server was this older gentleman (I think he was a head waiter of some sorts and his name started with a ""C"") who took our drink order. Twenty minutes later, no drinks...Our waiter was too busy kissing actress Regina King's a$$, who also happened to be celebrating her birthday at the table right next to ours. I finally caught his attention to remind him about our drinks and he responded condescendingly that our drinks were on our way. A younger waiter brought us our drinks, apologized for the wait and took over for the rest of the night. He was fantastic! I was ready to give him a huge tip after our meal but was disappointed when the receipt listed the older snotty waiter as our server.

Now to the food...We started with the Ceviche, which tasted like any ol' ceviche. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Hubby had the braised short rib. The meat was pull-apart soft and delicious. I had the Seared tuna adobo, which was AMAZING. Loved the crab on the side. We also ordered the mac n cheese with truffle oil. It was delish and was a larger portion than what you would get at Todd English Pub. I would order this again in a heartbeat! At the end of our meal, the nice waiter brought me a complementary birthday dessert and personally walked us up to Eve. Dinner for ran us about 250+ without tip. It was worth it.

I agree with other reviewers, the bad reviews are from those who get comp meals. These people get seated at the front at the low tables. Simply put, you get what you pay for."
test_2716,"The parrots are disgusting. They are noisy, dirty, and one even will curse at you. As far as Yoli's. I sat outside for 15 minutes before someone even attempted to take our order and then it was 45 minutes to get a sandwich! They blamed it on a large party being there and not even grill space. I would never go there again!"
test_2717,"Although the menu is fairly minimalistic, each dish packs a unique punch of flavor and freshness. The menu provided smaller plates and larger ones. Some of the smaller plates, including the lamb Kebob and grilled salmon, are a little bigger than the other small plates. I would definitely recommend ordering a large plate if you are hungry or splitting an appetizer and a few small bowls between a group. Overall great lighting, food, and ambiance, but service was a little slow."
test_2718,"Awful!  Went to AT and T bc my pictures are fuzzy and was told phone was defective- the lens.  Went to this store and although they had people swarm me anytime I looked at any product - NOBODY could see me about my phone.  Service after the sale of my six plus= zero.  This is exactly why American companies are folding.  Worship the dollar- big bucks.  The customer is last!  The atmosphere in this store is equivalent to a used car lot meets a strip bar.  Never again!  Sorry Apple- for being such a ""liberal"" company you love the dollar- but care little for the people unless one waves $$$$$$$$$ in the air.  Your store is a big silver pile of dung -"
test_2719,"Stayed here few weekends ago, bid on priceline and got the room under $100.not bad! Location is central and hotel is okay. Was pleasantly surprised with my room because it came with and full kitchen and also living area sort of. Also had complimentary breakfast in the morning.

I would have given it 4 star if they offered complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste as most hotels do."
test_2720,"Warning they are under new ownership and the food and menu have changed. The broccoli beef was very plain, but the rice was decent. They are also missing several items from the old menu. Overall I am not happy with the changes and will now have to look for another place to eat."
test_2721,"This place has been there forever and it has not change one bit!.  It is like stepping into a time machine back to the 70's.  But the steaks are good and the little old lady that servers you is nice and friendly.  They serve the steak on wooden cutting boards which are so worn that I believe they are originals from the 1960's On my birthday she gave me a free cheesecake slice to take home.  When I opened the box it was almost half a cake!.  I suggest you try it out before it is too late.

be warned - they are closed on sundays."
test_2722,"I am so happy I found this place. I was craving Thai food the other night and hadn't had Thai food on this side of town before but the yelp pictures for Gaati Thai Kitchen looked so good I immediately called in my order for takeout.

I ordered my standby of chicken pad Thai and after seeing the photos, added an order of the pineapple fried rice as well. I liked getting to choose the spice level for each of the dishes (a little spicy for the pad Thai and as mild as possible for the pineapple fried rice as I knew I'd be sharing that for lunch the following day). The pad Thai was nutty and delicious and everything I had hoped for (I probably could've made two meals out of the order as well but it was so good I couldn't resist) but the major stand out was the pineapple fried rice. It was sweet, savory, and had an amazing slightly curry taste. The rice was filled with cashews, chicken, a few shrimp, and plenty of pineapple. That did make 2 generous servings and I will be going back for that dish especially. 

In total, I think I've found a Thai restaurant to go to on this side of the valley which I'm really excited about. I like that they have both a really nice looking dining room to dine in but that I can also call and pick up a super tasty meal. The price felt a little expensive, but with the 2 dishes I could've gotten 4 generous servings out of it, and everything was so good that the price was more than worth it."
test_2723,"Got my nose pierced again ( got it done elsewhere a few years ago, took it out a couple months later due to not healing well) I feel much better about it this time, they were so much more knowledgeable and friendly here. They educated me and gave me direction on caring for and cleaning the piercing.  This place was great!"
test_2724,"We are from out of town and were a little under dressed since we were planning to bowl upstairs our friend were hungry and we entered the restaurant. The manager Jose Martel profiled us when we asked if it was fine dinning. He said in a defensive and irritated tone ""of course it is, would you like to see the menu!"" We were a little shocked by his reaction. But just ignored it. We ordered a bottle of wine and ordered a meal to split since we ate a full meal about 45 mins prior to walking into Michaels. The waiter came and told us that the Manager said that there was a split charge of $25.00 to split a meal. The Manager Jose came and was rude but at the end made an exception. He then profiled us for the second time and said ""next time YOU WILL KNOW BETTER since this is a fine dining restaurant."" We've gone to many Fine dinning restaurants much nicer than this place but never treated this way.  Wow! The waiters were very nice if would like to say...."
test_2725,"I know, I know, it's a Charlotte institution. Maybe I just don't get it. For me, Beef 'N Bottle is like reading The Great Gatsby; everyone tells you that it's amazing, but in the end, there are very few likable characters and you're left feeling like you wasted your time.

I'll start with the positives. I had no trouble making a same-day reservation, and we were seated immediately upon entering, even though we rolled in a bit early. Parking was a cinch. Our server was knowledgable and attentive. The menu is easy to navigate, and the kitchen is happy to customize your meal. Everything we ordered came out in a reasonable amount of time, and we left with full bellies.

There were, however, a handful of things that keep me from raving about Beef 'N Bottle like so many others. First, when our hostess seated us, she asked if we were celebrating anything that evening. I mentioned that it was my date's birthday. When our server greeted us a moment later, he came bearing glasses of champagne, declaring ""happy anniversary!"" Close enough. 

The two of us were sat at a four-top table in the center of the restaurant. A wooden pillar was between our table and the next, and it's apparently used as storage for that folding table waiters use to support their trays upon serving. This led to servers reaching around us several times during our visit to grab the folding table and tossing it back with a clunk once their tables had been served. 

We decided to start with a dozen raw oysters. I'm familiar with gulf oysters and know that their consistency is different from east coasters, but I still feel like you shouldn't *have* to chew your oysters. I could be wrong, but this tells me that those guys weren't at all fresh. Next we had the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous and presented well. Our server mentioned that ""they like to make the cocktail sauce spicy,"" but even his warning didn't prepare us for the horseradish assault we were about to experience. I'll be sure to come back next time I have a cold, because that sauce cleared my sinuses within seconds.  

Can we talk about the famous salad? While the bleu cheese dressing was exceptional, I can't understand why we're all so excited about building our own salads. The iceberg lettuce and provided toppings are basic at best, sliced too large for easy eating, and utterly wasteful given that the puny plate you're provided won't hold half of what you're served. 

Our entrees came soon after. I had the filet and scallops, and I added crab meat on top. My four large scallops were served in a pool of wine butter sauce, which was easily the highlight of my meal -- my steak, though ordered medium, was quite dry and the butter was necessary. The scallops were tender, however, they still had the ""foot"" muscle attached, and both of us found shells in the crab meat atop our steaks. I can't help but feel that when you pay $50+ per entree, you shouldn't have to pluck inedible pieces out of your mouth. 

Overall, Beef 'N Bottle didn't live up to the hype for me. Now that we've crossed it off our list, I can't imagine we'll bother with another visit."
test_2726,"ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.

very nice hotel. made me feel like i was a damn queen. our room was huge for two queen size beds and a living room area. bathroom is AHMAZINGGGGG. wow if i could design my bathroom it would look like that. the only downfalls to these hotel rooms was that our window faced a wall and the bathroom and shower doors did not have locks. obviously if theres multiple beds then multiple people are staying there and there should be locks on doors.

another plus is downstairs there is a VERY convenient food court with LOTS OF FOOD. i mean LOTS. wow. fast food and fine dining. THANK YOU. also casino is very lively and nice! would love to stay here again."
test_2727,"Stay away from this place.  They don't return calls, they don't refill prescriptions when YOU need them and they only show up when THEY want YET they will stalker call every month, even if you don't need an appointment and if you don't let them come EVERY month, they will send you a nasty certified letter that they will no longer provide care.  OH - and they sent the letter to my dad with ANOTHER patients name on the letter.
AWFUL AWFUL place.  Go to DoctorCare or Cholla Medical instead."
test_2728,"Not impressed, loud atmosphere, bland overpriced sandwiches. 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables. How many people does it take to make a sandwich? More like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work."
test_2729,"Ok I know this spot gets spotty reviews and I understand it to an extent. The portions aren't that huge,they aren't the most flexible when it comes to substitutions . That being said I actually enjoyed the food here . My mom and brother came here last year and he was underwhelmed about the chicken. I thought it was nicely seasoned and it went well in my dish. I ordered the biscuit and gravy over chicken plate(forgot the actual name of the dish) it was really good and flavorful. The gravy was so creamy and really went good over the biscuits. I didn't understand the jalape√±o garnish but I digress. My mom ordered the shrimp and grits. Now I'll admit I'm no grits fan,just don't care for the texture of them. I tasted some of her dish and it was like the best creamiest thing ever. She said the ham was really good. She got it last time she came and kept raving about it. There was something different about these grits . I'm still not a fan lol but I would order the grits dish here. The place is a bit pricey it's in between the Venetian and Palazzo after all lol. But the meal did hit the spot! Now my favorite part was the biscuits. They are so fluffy and they have like a sweet crust that's very faint on top which just makes it awesome especially with the butter spread on. The waiter was cool as well,forgot his name but it was a black man. He made us laugh when he said the waters include,Evian,bottled and Nevada tap . We got the Nevada tap. The ambiance is nice too. It's a bit dark but they have this nice light display above on the ceiling made with mason jars. There is a comfy seating area in the bar area that's nice too. I would come back again!"
test_2730,"Kyle and Mika  are awesome the best customer Service!!!!
I won't go anywhere else ...

If you want to be treated good, come see them!!!!"
test_2731,"Let me start my review by saying that I'm a rather picky person when it comes to hair stylists.  I'm particular when it comes to attention to detail.  A good trim is pretty hard to find, but not anymore.  

JESSICA is the real deal.  She is sweet, professional, and is all about attention to detail.  She gave me the best shampoo job that I think I've ever had.  It was more of a head massage really.  It was a struggle not to fall into a deep hypnotic slumber as she massaged my temples.  I couldn've sworn I was going to have to pay extra for that kind of attention, but turns out, that's just how she works.  What a star!

The other great thing I loved about this salon were the store hours.  They are open later than most (till 8pm, during the week), which is perfect for me.  

Looking forward to trying out more of what they offer in the future."
test_2732,Yum! I have been a fan of the pig since I moved here. Started at the location in rock hill. I bring all of my out of town company here and they love it! The Tega Cay Location seems to have a more extensive menu. You can never go wrong with the pulled pork. Check it out!

The food was wanna be Italain but tastes more I don't know.not italian....italian is easy ingredients and not a lot of them.
The place was empty something must be going on.
What is this number thing on the menu.....oh by the way what style of Pizza was it???I can get this type of dought at italian supermarket  ...oh and the dessert where to say to least pathetic..."
test_2736,"I called them based on reviews I saw here. They did not disappoint! I had them do my two area rugs that are both shag, long loop-type carpet. They look fabulous!

test_2737,The view is to die for if you were buying a mansion.  Outdoor seating is gorgeous  and this venue is HUGE.  The down side of being huge is the service may suffer. Fortunately for me I was well taken care of and had a great time there.  Food is what you expect from any vegas quality restaurant.  If I was staying at the wynn or encore it's a great place to get good eats but if I was staying at another hotel I may not have gone out of my way to eat there unless its for the view.
test_2738,"Unfortunately this location serves you ice cold meals. I will not be returning had I known my meal would feel like I'm biting into ice cubes when I order through the drive thru then I would have had them remake it or either that get my money back. My husband and I love Panera but the last few times we should have learned our lesson and not returned for the sake of spending $10 on the nastiness sandwich I've ever tasted. Coming from a woman who was hungry and looking forward to eating her expensive ""fresh"" sandwich complete let down threw it directly in the trash. It will be no surprise when this location is closed down for serving people everything but fresh food. That is all."
test_2739,"I've had this place on my bookmark list quite sometime - likely ever since I absolutely fell in love with the junction location (Cantina). The rustic/industrial decor, the fast, friendly and knowledgeable staff and, most of all the amazing  food. 

The other Playa Cabana locations are definitely pure Mexican as a majority with hints of other cuisine here and there. However, If the neighborhood didn't give it away, This spot is basically the Canadian born offspring of a Mexican and Korean. The local Korean neighborhood influence on the menu, from bulgogi shrimp tacos, to kimchi to a style of Korean fried chicken (in a taco) that I can't even pronounce. 

The decor is true to the brand, as mentioned it's a rustic, vintage look, kind of a hodgepodge of antique and garbage. My friend commented that this looked like a cartel hangout in Mexico... That was owned by a Korean family. 

For food we started with a few shareable apps amongst the 5 of us. Grilled calamari (so spicy but so amazingly delicious), Korean style short ribs (so meaty, lots of fat but I was glad we we're sharing because it was too salty for my taste to eat a whole portion), and the guacamole (because it's Plays Cabanas brainchild and obvi). 

For mains I went with 3 tacos (a classic move and really the only smart choice). I had the Korean fried chicken taco who's name is longer than I could pronounce, the bulgogi shrimp taco and the cabanas signature taco the beef short rib (although it fits in here more than any of the other locations). 

Service was pretty good and food was flying quick. The single bathroom was a bit odd with its vintage pinball game over the toilet (I would play it even if it did work - you only have so many hands in a bathroom as a guy and at one point or another they're both ""occupied""). 

Cocktails were awesome I had the Mezcal mule (a couple of times) which is basically a superior mule and makes the original taste like 'ass' (get it). Followed up by a couple rounds of corona and our night was set. 

Well done. I approve and will return for that calamari app and 3 rounds of bulgogi shrimp tacos! Yum!

Eatcrest Out!"
test_2740,"We ate at Canteen late-ish on a Friday night. Walked in and were promptly greeted by the host and told that there would be a 20 minute wait. We waited at the bar and had one of their delicious specialty margaritas, only to be told shortly that the group in front of us had cancelled and that we would be seated shortly. The rest of our party that had left to go to another bar joined us in our booth at the back of the restaurant. 

Our server found us and dropped off Duritos..a kind of house made alternative to tortilla chips. We immediately placed an order for guacamole and escabeche which were delicious and authentic. After our round of drinks we ordered dinner, I had the house nachos and tacked on an order of the street corn, the others an array of tacos, burritos and enchiladas. 

The food was slow to come out..probably 30-35 minutes which for the time of night and the amount of tables they had was probably a little too long. The food also came out sporadically like there may have been a disconnect between the wait staff and kitchen. My nachos were cold when they arrived so I sent them back for a quick warm-up, and when they arrived back at the table at least one person of party still hadn't gotten their food. The food itself was passable (the street corn was definitely a highlight!) but not the inventive/out-of-the-ordinary cuisine that was advertised on the menu. Was much closer to your run of the mill gringo Mexican food joint regarding the food than we had hoped for.

Atmosphere - lively, nicely decorated and comfortable 

Service - very good, timely and friendly all the way around 

Food - definitely something to be desired but not bad. It seemed as though all the other pieces are in place for this spot to be great but the food is holding it back some

Would definitely return for drinks and apps/lighter fare!"
test_2741,So darn good. I get the lamb shanks every time. Huge pieces of meat dripping off the bone. They just expanded the restaurant so now there's a lot more room for dining.
test_2742,"We went to eat at the Front Street Food Market and not the actual restaurant.

On their menu they only have lobster roll and snow crab fries available.  I was disappointed that they don't have the soft shell crab sandwich.  For $20 you will get both.  Starting off with the lobster roll.  Firstly it wasn't in a roll at all, just some toasted white bread.  The lobster ""sandwich"" is rather small but you do get large chucks of lobster claw meat.  Each serving is probably almost a claw.  You can judge whether it's worth the money or not.  The fries was good with lots of shredded crab meat and their own mayo sauce to top it off.  To be honest nothing special about it and after the meal, I was still kind of hungry."
test_2743,"Another breakfast joint checked out.

Driving on Durango, you cant help but notice their big sign stating that they have the best Eggs Benedict. Since my wife loved Eggs Benedict, we stopped off one sunday morning at 9 am to check it out. 

The menus they give you have breakfast on one side and lunch on the other. You can order anything on either side at any time.

So my wifey went with the Eggs Benedict ($8.95), my son went with the Club Sandwich ($8.95), and I went with the Barbeque Bacon Burger ($8.50).

The Eggs Benedict were ok. Nothing really wowed me about it and my wife agreed. The Club Sandwich on sourdough was not bad either. My son said he has had better Club Sandwiches at least two other places. As for my Barbeque Bacon Burger, it was on point meaning that it was really good. You get a half pound patty cooked to your liking (I got it medium rare which they cooked  perfect), lettuce, tomatoes, barbeque sauce and of course, bacon. It was a very good burger. Matter of fact I was not hungry again until dinner time that evening.

Service was hit and miss. We got sat down right away. Got our orders in a timely manner and refills on water were constant. What bothered me was that when I asked for the check, our server said she would be right back with it. 10 minutes later we havent heard from her. So we decided to go straight to the cash register to pay.

Overall, for a breakfast joint, everything seemed to average out to about 9 to 10 bucks a plate. I was not impressed at all with their Eggs Benedict. I'm not in any rush to come back here any time soon.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #192"
test_2744,I used to enjoy coming to this location. I think they must have changed management. I only visit about once every 2-3 months for staff meeting food. The energy is low with the employees. The manager has an apparent  sour attitude. I seen her and another employee giving each other a look while serving a customer that may have been a little indecisive. It was very unprofessional. The other employee was not happy to be there herself. There is a few employees that are wonderful and they would be the only reason I would return.
test_2745,"I have been here for the high tea experience. Recently my husband and I  were craving for some buttery croissant. He found this place again for us. Surprisingly they moved their location two windows away.
After they moved, there are more seating and the place looks brighter.
The food are high quality and delicacy. We both enjoyed our croissant. For the high tea, I would recommend it, but last time we visited I don't like the choices of the tea. It disagreed my tea snacks. I have to admit that the high tea set really looks fancy for Instagram"
test_2746,"We stopped in today for the first time. The waitress, Lisa, was super nice and attentive. The food was really good for the price. It tastes like a combination of grandma's cooking and old fashioned diner food. The atmosphere was actually pretty cozy and comfortable, too. My boyfriend got a fish sandwich that was simple but (the one bite I got to try) was probably one of the best around. Reminded me of a fish sandwich we got at the beach a couple years ago. The hash browns were delicious patties, also probably the best we've had. He also said the fries were incredible. 2 full meals, drinks, and soup, under $40. We each brought half our meals home, so definitely get your money worth. Well go back and try some of their desserts for sure!"
test_2747,"D- No Good
My house was flood damaged. All floors needed replaced, dry wall repairs, entire interior painted, and new base boards. Laminate flooring and tile work looks good but paint job no good. Finish work terrible!  Tried to cut corners hoping we wouldn't catch it. Left the house a mess. I won't hire these guys again nor will I recommend them."
test_2748,"Used to be a Gelato/ Ice Cream Shop (a Very Good one) on the opposite side (facing Kenilworth Ave.) of the Italian restaurant ""Dolce Ristorante"" (same Owners)... Now, you must go into the Restaurant to get their Gelato... For some years I did not go back because I assumed I would not like the food!  Italian is usually really good or if not I do not want to use that language on yelp...  So finally I venture into ""the Restaurant to find out - for me and you!

Everyone has told me when they eat in the Restaurant : Only Chocolate and Vanilla were being served that day!  Today I noticed the same!  Only Chocolate or Vanilla or Both or Both with some Espresso poured on top (as I ordered) with a Side (full Dessert) Piece of Tiramisu, kinda in that order I had a Pasta dish too!

This place is I guess you could say INSIDE ""Dolce Ristorante"" or you could say something else and you may still be correct!"
test_2749,"Pete Kelley's Auto goes beyond what customer service is all about.  I had/have a computer issue with my Ford Escape and they went beyond the call of duty to fix it.  I have been with my previous mechanic(amazing peeps) for a solid 10 years but went to Pete Kelley's because I have gotten to know George (owner) as a fellow Sunnyslope Kiwanis member.  

Beyond giving me a courtesy vehicle(WOW), they explained each step they have taken to solve my issue.  They are a stellar place that I can compare to no other. 

I am likely leaving my old mechanics behind (sorry) for Pete Kelley's.  How can I beat this kind of service?"
test_2750,The only pub I've been to with lamb chops on the menu. The happy hour specials are great too.
test_2751,Warm and relaxing atmosphere to chill with friends.  Friday fish fry and Old Fashioneds are the best in town.
test_2752,Hands down amazing food and service! Fantastic cocktails! The quality of the food is exceptional. Every bite of everything we had was delicious! Can't say enough about how great this place is! Finally a cool hip and comfortable Japanese fusion local place that is open for lunch until late night with 2 happy hours and a patio that is dog friendly. Definitely a rare local home run!! We are regulars now!
test_2753,Great meds always! Best staff and best prices. This is my favorite dispensary. Lots of selection to choice from and best flower in valley !
test_2754,"We had be wanting to try city BBQ and we finally did. If they want to survive in the future they have work to do. The person who takes your order was not very friendly nor did he give the proper attention to the customer. While taking our order he was having a side conversation with someone else. The restaurant was dirty, they have bottles of sauce on every table in squeeze bottles that are transparent however they clearly do not clean the bottles, there was dried old sauce on the tops and in the tip were the sauce comes out. They have a fixing bar also with sauce and it is not very clean either burnt sauce caked in the open containers. See my pictures..... the food was not hot at all. You would expect being a new restaurant that it would be very clean but that's not the case at all. Very disappointing!!!"
test_2755,Don't even know where to start!! I ran over a piece of someones exhaust!!!! I messed my mustang up so badly I was afraid to even limp it home. I was referred to Scottsdale Muffler by a friend. As soon as I told them the type of vehicle I had and described what happened.....the gentleman on the phone had a good idea of what I had damaged. My husband took the car in and had the work done. They had guessed the damage correctly....the quote was accurate!!!! I don't know how he knew that! My husband is very picky.....he was very satisfied! Nice old school family atmosphere that you don't find anymore. I highly recommend them for any auto work you need. I needed BOTH my headers welded as well as my differential seal replaced. They did it all in a timely manner. The price was unbeatable. They saved me sooooo much money as I thought I would have to buy new ones. Drove my Mustang today and it ran like a champ! Thank you to Scottsdale Muffler
test_2756,"This is the best Chinese Restaurant in Summerlin. The Dim Sum is made fresh on demand. However the menu has all of the traditional Chinese dishes. You must go and try the Dim Sum, Shrimp fried rice, Mongolian Beef, Eggplant, vegetable egg rolls, etc
Great service and Outstanding fresh ingredients = a great dining experience"
test_2757,Sheynna is extremely talented. She listened well and I got exactly what I wanted. My vision came to life thanks to her! She is brilliant in balayage and really knows her stuff. From the hair trail to my wedding day she was great. She did a beautiful bohemian updo with a braid and a flower crown. Amazing! Love her work. I am very much happy with my results on my wedding day and my pictures show it. Thanks Sheynna!
test_2758,"The services they provide are good. Their scheduling and billing are terrible at best. 

Got a referral to Valley ENT from my doctor after going to another ENT Doctor who only knew the word ""surgery"" for a deviated septum when I complained of allergies. Turns out going here they never even suggested surgery instead did allergy testing and gave me a prescription decongestant spray and put me on immunotherapy drops. The results were outstanding!!!

Being on time and billing though are catastrophic. 

Usually, you wait 15-30 minutes beyond your scheduled time to see the doctor. But on the most important visit, the one where they give you your results and talk about treatment plan the practitioner was 1 hour and 20 minutes late. Unfortunately, I had another immovable appointment I had to get to. As I was walking out I ran into her and she told me she would make it quick. So we ran through everything and she suggested I do the immunotherapy. I agreed. I called in that Friday to place my order and they told me that the Practioner needed to see me again because she didn't have enough time to go through everything when I was in. 

Of course it took two weeks to get another appointment, and of course they charged me for it. 

That leaves me with my billing complaints. Demand that they tell you the cost upfront - if you don't good luck. 

I have been there 4 times. Each time I paid a large sum (over $200) for the previous visit. Yet, I still get a bill after the insurance adjustment and their bills do not make sense. 

For instance. 

$600 bill
$278 adjustment for insurance
$341 payment
Balance of $312.96

If you understand math you can see that on my $600 bill they collect over $900

I pointed this out and they insist the amount charged is actually the amount AFTER my payment (yeah right) and then the insurance and then I pay the balance. 

For anyone in accounting is this GAAP? Heck no it isn't. This is IRS puts you in the pokey kind  of accounting. 

This place is in desperate need of a COO and a CFO. 

The doctors and practitioners are great, very knowledgeable, the staff is friendly and apologetic but the operational processes of this place prove that doctors are not taught basic organizational management and thankfully the highest number of body parts doctors have to count to are 10 fingers and 10 toes. And at this office, it is fortunate you have only 2 ears, 1 nose, and 1 throat because anything over that would stretch their intellectual ability.

In summary, I believe their slogan should be ... thank God we aren't accountants."
test_2759,I recently went into Midas on N Scottsdale rd because they were able to get me in for an oil change on my 2009 Audi when I got there I had the very fortunate pleasure of running into James the store manager and he told me of course I needed that oil change he then found I had a bad tire and helped me with that and the shop being as efficient as it is did a full diagnosis and found out I needed front brakes he quoted me a very reasonable price for everything and in the end James and his staff came thru with everything and in the end quoted me a little less based on come complications with parts being delivered wrong ( not their fault ) it is hard to find honesty in auto repair but at Midas you will when you ask for James
test_2760,"This is a decent buffet. About $25 for weekday lunch and it includes house wine and beer.  There was s shrimp and ceviche and guacamole and prime rib and sushi.

The food is ok, service was fine, and the restaurant is clean. The meat was overcooked and the selection is limited.  Compared to the Paris' buffet, same price not Inc beer/wine, this pales in comparison.  

But I was able to have a low carb meal there: shrimp, chicken, turkey, smoked salmon, steamed veggies, and salad.  A bit more than I would pay - I wish they would offer a no booze choice as I hate beer and don't drink cheap wine."
test_2761,During daylight You can't even see the code you're entering and the keypads don't function well so it was nearly impossible to rent a bike. They could have used the Citibike system but Nooooo. The three stars are only because I love bike share and it is awesome to get around town on a bike but please get a different system!
test_2762,"OK so I go to watch ""it"" with my friends n so like my friends dad was wit us so we could get our tickets dunno y the movies 18+ but we anyway so he's like I'm not going in only the kids are ok n the workers are like alri, as soon as he leaves they're like o u can't buy food cus u need an adult o shit u can't even watch the movie n wouldn't let us EVEN IF WE HAD OUR FUCKING TICKET. Treated us like sht n went around telling all the workers to not let us in or let us buy food n kept pointin to us so we ended up changing our tickets to Annabelle which btw already seen it so yay I payed to watch a movie twice. NEVER COME HERE GO TO SILVERCITY! Y Tf do I gotta give a star to post this its acc -262728 stars."
test_2763,"The food was okay our server was great! And the guy with the accordion was sweet!   We called in advanced for a reservation for 13 people.  We asked in advanced when making the reservation if separate checks were okay as we are here on business and company policy dictates this... and were told yes separate checks were okay. At the end of our meal they brought out 1 check with the normal additional gratuity added for large parties. Which we expect. When we asked the server for the separate checks he said that they could not do that.  We asked for the manager, who rudely told us no even after we explained the hostess had said it was okay.  She stated that she did not have time to deal with this as she was busy operating the house and walked off. The server was able to accommodate us eventually by running our cards for the individual meals we ordered..  Due to the manager being uncaring  and rude we will never be back again.. I feel for the servers there..but know as this place is one of those nostalgic places people will continue to go.  It is doubtful that the owner/manager will respond to this  based on what she said to us tonight ."
test_2764,Was here earlier today they let you stay as long as you want. I just get a good lunch service is still the same grill cheese was ok. Wilke snack wrap better. This is my new spot for when I have to edit photos. Price is nice. They let you fill up your own waterbottle! let's just say I filled it with ice tea then they did let me switch to another drink. That doesn't happen too often. Comfortable seating to. And chargers. If you go in the weird hours you can focus more on your work.
test_2765,"I recently relocated to Henderson, and took my dog here to meet the grooming staff and set up an appointment shortly after I arrived.  
The next day when I went to drop of my dog, the groomer I met and made the appointment with was not there!  So, why did she make the appointment if she knew she was not working that day??  I went ahead and left my dog with the self described manager, but the experience left a bad taste.
When I picked up my dog I made an appointment for 4 weeks out, as is my usual schedule for grooming.  When I got home and checked, I noticed they had made the appointment for 3 weeks, not 4.  I immediately called and talked to the same groomer who made the appointment and requested it be corrected to 4 weeks.  She said sure, no problem, she would make the change.
Yesterday I received a reminder for my appointment, for the wrong 3 week date!  They obviously had not corrected the schedule.  I called, went over the scheduling error, and the woman admitted the appointment had never been corrected, but she would set it up for me.  I told her not to bother.  
I will not be returning."
test_2766,"We love Thai House at University.

We've done dinner and lunch here. Lunch prices are more reasonable of course but portion sizes are good for both meals.

I cannot eat peanuts but there is lots on this menu that works for me.  I've had shrimp, chicken and vegetarian meals here. I love the hot jasmine tea. 

The staff here is very gracious, as I have found all Thai people I've known. They are efficient without being in the way regarding refills, clearing dishes, etc. We seem to get the same waiter for 75% of our visits.

The food is filling though everything I've ordered has seemed light.

The booths are comfy. I've sat at a table once. I don't like tables, here or any where.

Soothing decor, cool waitstaff uniforms.

All around, an enjoyable dining experience."
test_2767,"As I enter this place the guy at the front desk (who unfortunately i believe is the owner) was extremely rude. I showed him my voucher and without even taking the time to fully read through the voucher he jumps the gun and ass-umes it isn't valid (it was totally valid and he was pretty embarrassed - duh). He had no qualms with expressing some hostility. Not exactly the most professional person in the world. Basically just abrasive and disgruntled. Hopefully he is not like this everyday. As they say ""you never get a second chance to make a first impression"".  The rest of the staff that we saw were friendly, and the particular woman we dealt with was excellent. This place would've gotten a MUCH higher rating if not for that bad experience. Moral of the story is... a wee bit of customer service goes a long way."
test_2768,"Rows and rows of games - mostly pinball and a few old cabinet games. Many are their original price of a quarter or two, the modern ones a bit more. My husband and I spent at least three hours here and had more fun (and a better return) on our money than any of the casinos downtown. I highly recommend taking a break from the Strip and coming out to the Hall of Fame to play. Proceeds are even donated to charity so you aren't just lining some fat cat's pockets."
test_2769,"Modern European?  This place is a diner that serves burgers and sandwiches and breakfast food, among other things. 

I'm from out of town and I ate here today. Very unimpressive. Prices are low but so is food quality. 

They don't take anything except cash. Why not take debit cards?  Because they have an ATM machine that they can charge you a fee to use!"
test_2770,"I went to TopGolf yesterday as part of a Team Building event where I work.  It was okay.  I do not normally golf.  Despite that, it was fun enough to shoot a few balls.  I am not a good golfer though."
test_2771,It was a pleasant surprise. Food was good service was excellent and the music was great. They need to work a little bit more on flavor and portions were too small.
test_2772,First off customer service needs to be way better at this location. Employees always have an attitude and never have a smile on their face. You shouldn't charge people $0.49 per cup when getting ice cream what the hell am I supposed to put the ice cream in for free my hand? Not everyone wants their ice cream in a cone.  And then they make you pay for the ice cream first before you they even scoop it for you.  I'm guessing they do this because people have ordered ice cream and walked out without paying lol ghetto. And then I like how they have pictures of people who have shoplifted on the glass window
test_2773,This weekend was my first time in a Bealls store after hearing such good things about it from serval family members I thought the store was ok but we experienced the worst customer service possible from an employee by the name of Carly she was so rude and looks like she hates her job I don't know if she treats everyone this badly or she just does not like certain people what ever her problem is she is a disgrace to customer service representative everywhere
test_2774,It was great that they delivered late but I wasn't too impressed with any of the food or blown away.
test_2775,Found out about this place a few years ago and wish I found it sooner.  Best BBQ around!  A few unique items on the menu also to compliment standard BBQ fare.  Wings are a must try for anyone. Service is good as I would expect for a smaller establishment.  Can't wait to go back.
test_2776,"I was a long time Phoenix resident and after moving away and having to come back for a work trip, I was excited to stay at Hotel Palomar!  I took a cab from the airport and from the minute the car pulled up my experience was nothing short of spectacular!  Fantastic quick, easy, and dare I say enjoyable check in!  The valet attendant, the gentleman at the counter, everyone greeted me sincerely, the valet walked me in, welcomed me to PHX, and was very pleasant.  It seemed more conversation than business, and still very polite and professional.  The perfect combination of helpful and not pushy.  

The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are spacious.  A bit of construction noise during the day, but why would you be in your room during the day?  And if you are, they left a nice little note about the noise and some earplugs . . . problem solved!  A $10 'raid the mini bar' credit for being a Kimpton Intouch member (score) because who doesn't love to raid the mini bar!  Other perks include free access to Gold's Gym, cocktail hour daily from 5-6 and the Blue Hound restaurant is one of my favorites for happy hour.

Overall, this is an amazing hotel!  Great rates and they made me feel special and welcome. I look forward to more business trips to Phoenix so I can stay at the Hotel Palomar!"
test_2777,"I started to replace a light fixture on a ceiling and found some burned wiring. I called these guys and talked to Preston. He simply had me text him a picture of the problem. He saw right away that the burned wiring was a part of the fixture being replaced (I'm pretty ignorant about such things). He then not only explained that I didn't need him to come out at all (though he would be happy to), he explained to me exactly why the wires got burned and how to prevent it in the future.

Top quality customer service! I would recommend any and everyone to this place after that great experience."
test_2778,"I placed a large takeout order (almost $100) late on a Thursday night and the gentleman made me repeat every part of the order at least twice. He didn't even bother to tell me what time the order would be ready. I frequent this place for lunch and use them for work events pretty frequently and have always had a decent experience but not this time.

When I got home and went to unpack the food, I realized the order was completely wrong. Checked the receipt and the order that was rung in was completely different then what I asked for and with totally different quantities. It was as if the order was erased and the guy just tried to make it up out of memory. Certainly was not please to have ordered mainly calzones and end up with almost all subs.

The most annoying part of the experience is the sausage, pepper and onion subs were 85% peppers and onions. There was about 10 slices of very very thin sausage on the entire sandwhich which I think is a ripoff for $8.99. Terrible experience overall and will highly make me reconsider ever going here again."
test_2779,"I order the Carne margarita and it was delicious as well of the pi√±a colada the service was the best starting with the hostess, waiters, and managers."
test_2780,Went with a large group & ordered many different dishes. Out of about 15 different dishes 2 were ok. In general Food is Bad. Devore is old & unattractive. There are many great restaurants in Vegas to go to. Skip this one.
test_2781,"This has been my eye doctor since I moved from the Detroit area 3 years ago.  They go above and beyond for their customers.  I chose them because I liked the style of their eyewear.  I like a more updated, urban style of glasses and I always find more than I was looking for when I come here.  The prices are good and they are cognizant of budgets without compromising your needs.  I also support them because they are a small business and the owner is very down to earth.  They always fit me in and no need has gone unattended since they've been my eye doctor."
test_2782,If you're a guy this is the place to go to get a screwed up haircut. Thank The Lord I always wear a hat cause if the general public saw my haircut they would run away like the Asians run from Godzilla. I never understood why people pay 30-40 bucks for a haircut until I went here. I highly would recommend a Man never go here.
test_2783,Delicious food & such friendly staff! I ordered the barberry rice & chicken...soooo good!!! My boyfriend used to work nearby & was a regular...he absolutely loves this place & they always remember him when he goes in. Highly recommend! Saffron ice cream sandwich is phenomenal...try it!!!
test_2784,"Danyelle is the most talented therapist I've ever encountered. I've been getting massages for years pretty regularly without ever finding a therapist that even compares to the triple digits that I've tried. She addresses all of my problem areas and actually manages to fully relieve the chronic back pain I've been experiencing most of my life. She uses a blend of pressure depth that flows blissfully for maximum relaxation and tension release. In fact, it's so relaxing that I've habitually slipped in and out of sleep during the sessions. Every time the massage is drawing to an end, I find myself wishing the massage could last all day. I cannot ever imagine a better massage -- highly recommended is the understatement of the century."
test_2785,"So, I've never before had Belizean food, but I figured why not try something new on a Saturday night? Turns out it's a glorious combination of cuisine from that entire part of the world with some great local dishes thrown in for more. We got the salbutas, marinated pulled chicken on fried discs of crispy maize dough, served with hot sauce. I would eat these every day of my life as they are the perfect combination of crispy, savory, and a bit of spice with the hot sauce. We then got the stewed beef and stewed chicken platters, both coming with flavorful meats with a side of coconut rice and beans, potato salad (with a hint of coconut), and a fried plantain. I also got a freshly cut coconut to drink that they then cut in half for us to scoop out the center. It was all really, really good food plus the service was unbelievably friendly and helpful in making choices. There is a great Groupon offered currently if you need that bit of push to try it out. Salbutas, I shall be back for you. Oh, yes, I shall."
test_2786,Really good food. Only gripe would be a menu that say it's available until 11AM only to learn that it's really only available to 10:45. We will be giving another place a try for football next Sunday. We'll be back for sure....just a bad experience.
test_2787,"Originally from Cali, i found out that my barber nikko worked here, and definitely one of the nicest shops I've been to. I felt very under dressed walking  in with a cut off shirt as I was going to the gym after the haircut. As I entered the building I was offered beverages, which was a nice change for me. The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable. It wasn't over crowded, and just felt like a good place to get a cut. As I finished my haircut the front desk lady was super nice and friendly. I definitely see myself coming back here. I recommend this place to anyone!"
test_2788,I just moved to Sunnyslope and if I had known this place was  here I would have moved sooner! I love going to breakfast and this is my new favorite place! Staff and food are both superb
test_2789,"Louis-Simon was terrific!  We booked a private tour (4 people) with him and he was incredibly knowledgeable about the city, its history as well as fun facts about every day Montreal life.  He was also very flexible as we saw things along the way that we wanted to spend extra time on, etc... Highly recommend him and Ca Roule."
test_2790,totally agree w/ the negative reviews here..shopping here is a nightmare..terrible customer service..bad morale..could not get help and when I did everyone in the store acts as if they are zombies..should have known when i tried to call first and took 10 minutes to get through recordings to talk to a person in the store...went to office max and had a completely opposite experience...everybody there acted like they were happy.
test_2791,"Another Tommy Guns location for a quick cut and shave.

First off I need to get something off of my chest: if you are going to spend a lot of time in very close vicinity of your clients, you should not smoke cigarettes. Now, as a person who doesn't really mind (but certainly still noticed), I still managed to be okay with the haircut. The ladies working in the shop were quite friendly but the person cutting my hair didn't want to carry a conversation. Instead I just got to watch sports center on the TV that's in the mirror.

If there's anything I could suggest to people going here, find out the name of the person who you want to cut your hair and stick to it. That way you'll get a consistent experience and know what to expect.

An okay haircut, but expect to pay a little bit more for the little perks."
test_2792,"My family and I have been coming here since I was a kid. We get our rice, produce, and seasonings here. The staff is friendly and treat you like family."
test_2793,"It's been awhile since I visited the peppermill line was huge there was an hour wait and it sucked not being able to make a reservation. Had brunch here with friends I ordered the French toast with the fruit and whipped cream. Loved how they had a photographer to take pictures at the table, she was very sweet. Food was ok loved the portion size and presentation."
test_2794,I haven't been to Black Beat Diner sense my teenage years and wow I felt like a young girl walking in. It has an old time feel and memories flooded back. The service was exceptional and their generous portions were filling.
test_2795,"Went there to get a couple bottles of juice since they have good pricing and will not be going back. Walked in the door and nobody acknowledged that we were there. Finally walked up to the counter and the guy waited a few minutes before we got a ""can I get you something?"" I asked about popular flavors and suggestions for mixing on certain flavors they had and he said "" I don't know"". So I guess if you know exactly what you need and don't mind waiting ten minutes for help to get out the door it would be the perfect place for juice. 
Also the shop was not very clean and the bottles looked gross. I will be staying with my normal Vape shops from now on."
test_2796,"Nice and friendly staff all the time.
I visit the place once in a while and they always have more than you could ask for.
Not the biggest Lee's but pretty well stocked, nice, clean and new.
Last time I tried the french absinthe N1 can't beat the ~$40 price on it. Looks like the real thing it has kind of caramelly color to it, as soon as you add the water it turns into milky refreshing goodness. 
I use naturally carbonated mineral water from Romania to dilute it, it tastes even better than the classic (water over sugar) recipe."
test_2797,"It's taken me awhile to write this. I scheduled a day to go to Sin City DIY and wrench on my truck. Showed up in the morning and was met by Tyler. Super cool dude and incredibly helpful. Spent most of the day changing out all fluids (front and rear diffs, transfer, transmission, oil & filter and flushing the cooling system), did my rotors and pads, changed the thermostat and drive belt. Did most of it myself and when I had a question, needed an extra pair of hands or just wanted to bs, Tyler was there to help. They had all the tools I needed, disposed of my old fluids, took all my trash. This place is a goldmine. I'm no mechanic and have limited knowledge but, Tyler educated me on things I knew nothing of and gave pointers to make certain tasks easier. Saved me a fortune having someone else do the work and I learned some things. I'll definitely be back to utilize their facility. My truck is running like a champ. Thank you! If you need a place to wrench on your vehicle, want to learn how to do things yourself or don't have the tools, this place is for you. Highly recommend them!"
test_2798,I love a lot of the food here and the prices are good but what I have noticed at this location is the temperature of the inside is WAY TO COLD! I always pack jackets for the family just to eat here but I'm actually over this location for this reason!
test_2799,"I have eaten Mexican food extensively throughout the entire SW USA for many years.   Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina have the best Fajitas that I have ever eaten anywhere, bar none!   They bring the Fajitas to the table and then throw on a large shot of clear liquor which instantly burst into flames.   We get the Steak Fajitas and the meat is deliciously flavored, soft - not dry and hard as so often they are else where, and mouth watering!   Of course you get the Nachos served immediately with both a hot dip and a hot bean dip.   With the Fajitas for 2 you get a very tasty cup of soup and then a large platter with rice and beans which are delicious.   The decor is simple with an outside eating area offered as well.   The service is fantastic, attentive and always give you the feeling they really want you to enjoy your meal with them.   On our second visit, though not our waiter, the waiter who had served us the last time checked on us several times to insure we were enjoying ourselves.   He actually remembered us from our first visit.   You can tell the staff enjoys working together and insuring that each customer enjoys their visit with them.   It has become our number one place to take visitors to eat and they are always impressed with the quality, amount and taste of their food!"
test_2800,"If you're looking for a cheap, quick bite on the strip, this is a place you would hit up. 

My friends and I were looking to have a snack during our 1.5+ hour wait for Bacchanal Buffet and La Creperie was perfect: simple and easy to share. We ordered two Roasted Chicken ($11.00) which consisted of rotisserie chicken, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, basil pesto & shaved grana padano. 

Overall verdict: pretty good. 

The crepe batter itself was a little sweeter than I would've liked it, the tomatoes had a weird texture to them and the basil pesto could have used a little more ""umph"", but overall, not bad for a snack. 

It was a definite plus that there were plenty of seating arrangements around and that water cups were free of charge. Yay! 

Keep quality expectations low, price expectations high, and you'll be fine in the City of Sin."
test_2801,"Cox basic cable is a joke.  After this whole digital upgrade the channels that were basic are no longer, my bill doubled in price, and all I'm being told is that the fcc is the ones controlling the price.  We have been loyal customers for 5+ years and all I get is a customer service rep wanting to argue with me how they are better than other providers and the price jump is out of their control.  Have fun loosing customers Cox, we won't be using you any more.  If I could give a negative rating I would.  Extremely disappointed."
test_2802,"I have tried several pool companies in the valley trying to save a buck. That is not the way to go. Most start out good but eventually will disappoint you with spotty service, failed promises, and eventually a green pool. I have had Blue Marlin for over 2 years and have never been disappointed. My pool is always clean and clear. You can tell that the water is balanced from the way it feels. I never have to worry about scrambling to get the pool clean by dumping a bunch of chlorine in it and crossing my fingers. Top notch service and very reasonable."
test_2803,"This place was totally a cool stop. Burlesque and DJ and bar? check.

Super busy on a Friday but we were still served reasonably fast. I loved the eclectic feel. fun place!"
test_2804,"This was one of my first finer dining experiences here in Pittsburgh. I came here on a Saturday evening at 8:30. The menu is contemporary American, and it features Appetizers, Main Courses, Vegetables, and Desserts (separate menu). While these options seemed deliciously great, the Family Style 4-course was the option my date and I went with. It's $45 per person, and each person gets 4 courses: one appetizer, one lighter dish, one entree, and one dessert. 

The portions were plentiful. Each course was as follows:

1) Korean BBQ Bibb Lettuce Wraps
2) Scallops with Blood Oranges
3) Chicken on Polenta and Lentils
4) Pineapple Caramel Bread Pudding 

My date was hungry, so he also ordered the Lamb Shank, which was equally amazing. 

No pictures were taken, as we don't do phones on date nights, but you can bet yourselves that the food was visually appealing and looked as good as it sounds. 

As a side note: the alcohol selection was amazing - while I forgot the names of the beers we ordered, they were high quality, refreshing and clean IPAs."
test_2805,"Still hands down one of my favorite not so hidden gems in Scottsdale. Great tacos & tequila 

*if you're up for a fun night hit up one of their tequila tastings* YUMMY"
test_2806,"I've been coming here since they opened.  Before there was Total Wine and when all you could get at Lee's, was the corporate wines they jammed their space with, you could always find a nice selection of great wines, reasonably priced.  When the craft beer craze exploded, Khoury was the first to provide an intimate space where you could sample wine and many different brews, either bottled & canned or from a rotating on tap selection.  The staff are knowledgeable, polite and very friendly and really seem to enjoy providing excellent service, which explains why this place is so popular.  My favorite place to relax, meet my friends and enjoy a great beer or wine."
test_2807,"The best bang for your buck close to the Vegas strip. The place is always packed (for that reason) but they are very efficient in churning out orders. You will probably have to wait a bit to get a table but turnover is high because people don't hang out there for too long. 

The burgers will definitely hit the spot after a night out. I would recommend doing animal style on the fries and not the burger if you get the combo. However, the fries in general were really disappointing (friend described it best as cardboard). The animal style with cheese and onions made the fries more tolerable."
test_2808,"Myron did an amazing job on our photos at Bear's Best for our wedding. We were so happy with everything. Myron perfectly captured our joy and happiness. Not only were the pictures fabulous, but Myron did an amazing job making our guests and us feel comfortable and at ease. We had amazing pictures because everyone felt so comfortable. 
On top of all of that, Myron is just a great guy. He was really friendly, and just an all around nice person. In many ways, he felt just like one of our guests! We are so glad that he was our photographer and we HIGHLY recommend him."
test_2809,Ok. Great concept just lacks in service. Food was good. Order the wings with awesome sauce! Truly amazing! Recommend coming during the summer months to enjoy the outside patio.
test_2810,"This place was awesome! Isabella was a phenomenal guide for our party of four and lead us through a 5 course tasting menu of amazing and diverse flavors, textures, and experiences. This is a 5 star place; it's pricy, so know that going into it, but extraordinary nonetheless!"
test_2811,"ordered for delivery, on the menu the have a Bacon cheddar cheeseburger sub. when it was selected it asked ""how would you like this cooked"" and ""Medium"" was selected.. when the order was entered ""medium"" ""confused them"". instead of calling to alleviate the confusion, they ordered bacon cheese fries and added $2.5 additional charge. so not only did i not get my cheeseburger sub, but i was charged extra for something i didn't order. when i called to explain the situation, they were very receptive to getting a chicken bacon ranch sub out, when the lunch rush calmed down (but i was a customer first). and hour and a half later (grumble, grumble went my stomach), they delivered A BACON CHEESEBURGER SUB!!.. i was extremely disappointed to say the least.. the only reason i gave 2 stars and not 1 is because Alex was apologetic and is able to get my money back for the sub with out any argument."
test_2812,"We had such a wonderful experience with this company! I would highly highly recommend. We actually booked by a third party agency cause their price was better than booking through Vision direct but the service of Vision was spot on! The plan with smooth and the personal was very professional. A major shout out to our driver Chuck Benson who was an absolute delight! He was so knowlegable and so friendly - he went above and beyond - just made it the most memorable trip we could have hoped for - well worth every cent we paid! If you go on this trip - ask for Chuck Benson, you won't be disappointed!!!"
test_2813,"Booooo!!!! Slow service and crappy food.
My taramind fish was cold- just asked for it
to be nuked cuz I was in a hurry. 
Sauce was too tangy I couldn't even finish it. Did I mention that the rice tasted funny?"
test_2814,"I was referred to this place by a friend actually. I came in hoping to get my problem fixed, but my hopes were crushed. My air conditioner in my car was not blowing. I left the car there overnight. When I came back to get my car the next day there was leftover trash in my car. I let that slide, because my air was blowing again. The air was hot, but I figured it needed time to start blowing cold air again, so I waited a day. The air was STILL hot. I took it to get checked by someone else, and they said there was no frion in the car. There were no leaks, so it just was not refilled.. As a shop who is supposed to make sure everything is fixed before giving someone their car back, I definitely think it should be their responsibility to make sure they put something as simple as frion in my car before giving it back. Not only that, but not my car has problems starting up since they changed the ignition switch. I had horrible service by this establishment, and I will never go back or recommend ANYONE to go here."
test_2815,"Buddhist bowl.  Awful, the use canned bamboo shoots and other canned ingredients.  Asked for extra spicy, instead of cooking with peppers, they give a container of hot sauce.  Manchu wok was 10x better"
test_2816,Soooo delicious! First time coming and glad I stopped in because my kids gobbled everything up. I got the sliders with Louis N Ana rub and dipped in the homemade Blue Cheese....and the Texas toast...yummy!
test_2817,"The noodles are great here! The traditional beef noodle soup is really good, and i love how you can choose the size of the noodles. I got the cold sesame noodles. I wanted a vegetarian version without chicken, and they replaced the chicken with lots of freshly chopped veggies, which i really appreciate. The place is really big with lots of seats."
test_2818,"We waited twenty minutes and never got served... they sat us down in a booth, and we saw them look at us a couple of times but no one came to our section. We really wanted to try it out but no one even asked us for drinks, this place was almost completely empty . We won't be coming back."
test_2819,"We r from out of town....saw the reviews & thought we would give it a try!!! Pizza was the worst!  Ordered margherita pizza 2 go...had one (1) piece of basil! $17???,, never again!"
test_2820,"So I'm in town working and went and sat at the bar to get a quick dinner before a show.  They had a dry Riesling on the menu and I confirmed with the waitress that it wasn't sweet.  So I get it that this is a strip of tattoo parlors, vape stores and college bars, but there are also quite a few great restaurants hidden around the area.  So, I was a littel surprised when my wine was beyond syrupy.  Then I ordered a specialty roll.  Honestly, I ordered a cooked tempura sushi with avocado.  It came drowned in about three different sauces.  It wasn't compelling.
On the positive side, service was fast and friendly.
The place was crowded and people seemed to be having a great night.
I won't be going back."
test_2821,"Azul was recommended to me by a co-worker who said that it is his favorite Mexican restaurant. It is located on a small street of houses and has a great d√©cor. We went and it was not busy but decided to sit at the bar. When we walked in the owner (or at least who I assumed was the owner) was sitting with some customers and told us to sit wherever we wanted. 

A forewarning, this is more expensive than most Mexican places and if you want to drink then I hope you have deep pockets. The soup is $8, the chips & tableside guacamole was $10 and the nachos were about $8. 

I ordered a double margarita which was $12 - small but strong. My husband had a Modelo - $4. Now you might not think this is anything awful but keep in mind that a pitcher of Sangria is $30, a pitcher of beer is $20, a pitcher of margaritas is $50. 

Since this was our first time, I asked the bartender what was good. He suggested the mahi mahi tacos for fish lovers(soft or hard). I wasn't in the mood in the mood for fish so I opted for a chicken burrito - $14. When I asked how big the portions were since I wasn't sure if we wanted an appetizer he said that he can't even finish a burrito. Now I happen to be a fan of Qdoba and I'm thinking that big however it was definitely manageable. (Did I feel like a big eating it in front of him, yes - but who cares). The burrito was stuffed and then possibly grilled slightly to give it a little crunch. I was happy and would recommend it.

My husband ordered the carnitas plate $14 - slow braised pork (sweet and yummy), side salad with a nice dressing, corn or flour tortillas, black or pinto beans on the side and a small scoop of rice. He was happy with his meal which was clearly made fresh. My only complaint was the rice which seemed dry and crumbly. 

My only complaint was that the woman (that I'm calling the owner) went behind the bar and was making a bunch of different drinks right in front of us. Instead of asking us how the food was or trying to engage us at all, she appeared cold and disinterested. I'm always going to go back someplace if the food is good but it bothers me when you are in customer service. 

When I looked at the menu to review it when writing this, I took a look at the lunch menu. The lunch menu has the same items for a dollar or two less so I think I would suggest this place for an afternoon opposed to a night."
test_2822,The Shepherd Eye Center had been recommended to me from someone who had undergone eyelid surgery. Dr. Reddy the surgeon made me most comfortable and we even chatted about other matters to keep me at ease. I am still a patient of the clinic and Dr. Reddy is still my doctor and continually receive compliments and I am very pleased that I decided to have the surgery and gained a wide range vision again
test_2823,"Despite the poor service here, my family comes here for special occasions because the quality of their dishes is pretty decent. There is a wide variety of dishes and you can also order a 10-course meal if you'd like. The dim sum menu is also very selective.

But as mentioned the service is terrible! You'll expect to wait 20-30 mins for your food especially if you come with a large group. I know you cant expect good service from an asian restaurant but I'm used to the quick eat in and out type of meal and it's definitely subpar service here! The waiters are also not very friendly and give you attitude when you ask when your food is coming.

I only give this restaurant 2 stars because the ambience of the restaurant is nice and the quality/selection of food is good."
test_2824,With a very fake and annoying smile I was told they don't accept a reward for my beverage.
test_2825,"There's something about the vibe at Maizie's that feels so comfortable. It feels retro to me... a flashback to Indiana in the late '70s - early '80s. Maybe it's the giant bowls they serve the salads in. They make me think of Pizza Hut after a softball game circa 1980. 

Here are some things I like best about Maizie's:

The wingless buffalo dip is deadly -- I mean that in a good way (and it should be on the late night menu). It's gotta be mostly cream cheese... how can you go wrong?!

The fries are good, but the potato cakes are frickin' awesome! Thick mounds of really yummy mashed potatoes with a hint of horseradish, barely browned on either side.

The inside out burgers are literally filled with the items described (my fave is the Feta burger - stuffed with feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and served with a thimble full of chipotle humus that packs a slight punch and is great on top of the burger as bizarre as that sounds)"
test_2826,Great small intimate place for any kind of setting. This was my first visit and it was with a bunch of my girlfriends! We sat on the spacious patio.  We each had one or two glasses of wine. And about half the table ordered food. Everybody feel in love. I love this place. Delicious menu! And very accommodating staff. I will come back!
test_2827,I've had century link for a year now and at the there were no problems until I dropped the internet service then my phone stopped working and I waited for 4 days on my 2 days off for 2 weeks and the repair man never showed up then lied and told me I showed up and you weren't home. I called century link and they blaming me I will never use them again I guess they forgot we have cell phones and home phones are obsolete in the year 2015
test_2828,"I would call this either the LA Cucharacha motel or Buy My Drugs Here motel. The place is dirty, cockroach infested, a central drug corridor and the most lying little bitches ever working the front office. They will say one thing to you telling me they do background checks of their potential guests for felonies, etc. Then you find out that they just let whoever they want stay there as long as either the price is right or some guy gives them a compliment. We were told to remove our other comment because  it was damaging to the hotel. No we will not remove the comments.  Fix the place. It's disgusting."
test_2829,"Awesome Hakka food and great quantities too! 

We tried the Chicken Manchurian and Chilly Chicken, most places these two dishes end up tasting very similar but not here. There was a distinct difference is taste and boy did I love the chilly chicken! It's spicy not fake spicy! We also tried the veg Hakka noodles which was good but I preferred the egg fried rice we had ordered. 

We placed an order for 4 dishes and the quantity will blow your mind away. We ended up having to take it all home and it lasted for 3 whole meals. 

Definitely worth a try and more. 

Ps: The service is speedy so don't expect a lot of conversation. The owners did however show up at the end to ask if we enjoyed the meal."
test_2830,"LAst January my Daughter got married at the Castle.  When we got there at the specified time for our rehearsal the only person who was there was the owner as there was a bridal show going on in Phoenix that weekend.  The wedding planner who was supposed to be helping us wasn't there and we had to wait almost an hours for the ""Owner"" to get to us...she was showing the venue to prospective clients.   She completely rushed thru the process verbally in approximately ten to fifteen minutes and  there was not a run thru at all.  When I questioned things she rudely informed me that she had ""done this hundreds of times and don't worry!""  The next day when we got there to set up she was, again, giving a tour while leaving us waiting and not knowing what was going on. She didn't know ANYTHING!  She thought the wedding was going to be outdoors when it was planned to be indoors so she had to scrammble to push the tables apart.  The whole affair felt thrown together and she was not helpful at all!  My daughter got a lot of promises with very little delivery.   The guests made the event and the joy of the occasion overshadowed the debacle that was Ashley Manor!  Go somewhere else would be my suggestion...you can get pretty pictures lots of places!"
test_2831,Great location and I like the menu. Just make sure you aren't in a rush since PJ's gives you plenty of time and never are in a hurry to take your order or prepare your food. If you have kids they will enjoy sitting at the table inside the vault. (This was a bank back in the day so they cleverly incorporated the vault into the interior design.)
test_2832,"Nice little cemetery.  Went with the scouts to put flags on the Vets graves.  So many Vets!  Wonderful to see all the flags flying.

Thank you Vets!  

Stopped by a few family member graves and noticed a problem on a grave marker.  Stopped by the office and they put info in the computer and ordered a replacement.  Surprised by how well the staff worked with us."
test_2833,"Our group of Three ladies and myself had a great lunch today at LOS DOS MOLINAS on south Central in Phoenix.
  We started with their Kick A. Margaritas which it does not get better than this.  With our drinks we had lots of chips and super red and green chili sauce.
  I had the Blue cornTamales with extra beans.  The ladies Dina and Karen had Talapia fish tacos.  One lady had Combo Talapia Fish Tacos , and a green corn tamales.  This was Carla who was our driver.  Her drink sadly was diet coke.
  The food was well cooked, fresh and very, very good.  I can not wait to return as this is one of my top favorite restaurants in Phoenix Metro.
  Manager Dominique and waiter Carlos do on o.utstand job in making everyone happy.
  Try this restaurant.  You will not be disappointed.  It is Outstanding.  All my guests agreed.

sincerely,

Eddie Altman  Jr."
test_2834,Dr. Couser and his staff are definitely 5 stars! What a great job on my daughters teeth and now my son just got his braces on! I can't praise him enough!
test_2835,"The quality of the food here teeters on the line between low end dine-in and just quick fast food- the ""I'm so hungry, I'll eat anything and it'll taste good anyway"" kind. 
The fish tacos are good. The fish is well seasoned and fresh. The cabbage gives the tacos good flavor. Anything that makes this place stand out? No not really. But if you're hunger and looking for a place to sit down, this place will fill your tummy. I wouldn't have eaten here if it wasn't down the street from my friend's house."
test_2836,"Glad I gave this place a second chance. The first time it took me half an hour to get my street corn, the second time my huevos came out in a flash. Both were delicious. The atmosphere and space are really chill. Nice place to nurse a beer outside on a warm evening."
test_2837,"Just went here for a birthday massage. The place was quiet and relaxing. Had my own room. There was about a 3 minute wait. The lady only asked me how much time, then went to work on my feet. It was incredible. She hit so many pressure points with perfect amounts of pressure. She finished with a shoulder & back massage that was also wonderful. A little pain, but the good kind.  No chatting, no noise. Just a very calm environment. I gave a generous tip & I plan to go regularly."
test_2838,The staff is very helpful and friendly. Very close to home and much easier than going to the post office. They can pretty much handle everything here.
test_2839,"Great buffet. Would have liked wine to have been included for the price, but soft drinks/coffee/tea were. The buffet was gorgeous. Very high quality food. Lots of meat, seafood, vegetable, ethnic, and dessert choices. Not overly crowded at 5pm. Service from waiters not so great. They cleared plates well but did not refill water and tea."
test_2840,"While I want to give this 3.5 stars, Yelp only allows full stars so dropping to a 3! This was a lot of fun and really cool concept - don't get me wrong, but gets expensive and QUICK. We played an hour with 3 people and then extended it 30 minutes, had a few beers and one app. It was $130 bucks. Also the ""supreme nachos"" were ten bucks and literally had 8 chips on the plate. This is a sports bar and golfing venue - no need to try and be fancy / pretentious. When I ask for nachos at a sports bar give me NACHOS. Service was ok, nothing special but have had worse."
test_2841,"Food was really good. The place was nicely decorated considering it was inside a Gas Station. It has a really nice, big fish tank I ate beside too. Line was super long but they got your order out in a timely manner. 
I gave it 4 stars not because of the food but because it was overpriced considering the portion  they gave you. I came here because I saw it on a TV show but I wont be coming back. Really good though."
test_2842,"Un tout nouveau caf√© dans le coin de Pointe-Saint-Charles qui √©tait attendu depuis un bon petit bout. On a l'impression de se trouver dans une grande gall√©rie d'art et les morceaux affich√©s aux murs donne l'impression que √ßa serait un bon endroit pour y faire un vernissage.

test_2843,I had high expectations for this place and ordered Basil Chicken spicy level a 4. Not good
test_2844,"Hands down, the best male barbers in the whole of toronto.

But it's meant for people with short hair and appreciate a fade or a line up.

These guys spend an hour making your short haircut perfect (compare to the 10 min job you might find at lets say topcuts).

Professional, and there's always an interesting and philosophical conversation going on between the guys.

My favorite barber is Barry, because he cuts your hair without talking to you and does a great job while at it ! Amazing. 

Alot fo the raptors go here and occasionally, i've seen some hip hop and hip pop toronto artists in there as well. But it's a totally low key place and a haircut is only $15. I usually leave total $25 with a tip because they honestly do a great job."
test_2845,"I come here at least once a week. Delicious!!Even though it has that ""hole in the wall"" look, don't let that stop you from going in. It's some of the best food in town!"
test_2846,"I really like the new studio. I have been going to this studio on and off (due to money and time issues) since 2009 when the studio was under a different owner and in a different location. I've also been to studios near my hometown in Massachusetts that I didn't like nearly as much because the teacher barked orders into a microphone and said that every posture should hurt. The new location is excellent and the studio is much nicer with the hard wood floors than the old carpet. They also clean the yoga room after each class which I appreciate. I do miss some of the older teachers but the newer ones are still good.

The teachers here are very helpful when you ask them a question. I love that Shannon or Zeb will stop the class to show the correct way to do a posture. I also love that all of the teachers will point out people when people are doing well. I know when I hear my name it gives me a boost of confidence and I try harder to do the postures the correct way. I will say I was surprised the one time I rejoined and they recommended no water during class but I have since learned that class really does go better without it. 

I'm not going to lie, this yoga is pricey but ALL Bikram yoga studios charge the same, if not more, for tuition. Also, if you have issues taking your shoes off and walking around or seeing nearly naked people in class and naked people in the dressing rooms, this probably isn't for you."
test_2847,Great service. Professional and courteous. Having service right at your doorstep is such a wonderful luxury. I would recommend to all who have electronic fix it needs. Cool van too!
test_2848,"Came here for the first time to see Gwen Stefani, I work on the strip at planet Hollywood so decided to walk to the arena right after work to avoid traffic/ parking.  Show started at 730, we arrived at ""The Park"" around 715, we knew we had plenty of time so stopped into the Beerhaus for a couple beers before the show.  

We decided to head in about 730p,  there was no crowd, and we were in within 5 minutes.  We were directed to our seats and the arena was pretty empty so we decided to grab another beer and snack.  Beers were pricey but what you would expect from any other arena at $8-12 beer.  

Overall, sound was great, bathroom line short, plenty of VIP lounges and easy to get around.  Would definitely watch another event here, especially since hey it's vegas, I'm a local and it's in my backyard!  #vegasstrong"
test_2849,This neighborhood restaurant is a hidden gem. I love the feel of the restaurant. It has a Shabby Chic/Modern Farm to Table feel.  I ordered the bacon wrapped meatballs and Pesto Sausage Linguine. It was very tasty and delicious ! I would love to come back and try other items on the menu.
test_2850,"They have everything you will ever want on your menu. This location is very central and although it looks small, don't let it fool you. The top section is expansive. They attract a rather large crowd since it's inside of a mall and attached to a hotel. But the wait wasn't too bad for us when we went on a Thursday and Friday morning. The selections are expansive and almost everything on the menu was delicious. Definitely had difficulties deciding on what to order. But I would definitely say try their omelets and crepes. Their coffee is great too! Smooth and strong. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a great breakfast experience in Montr√©al."
test_2851,"Overall the place is cool. I prefer a thick meaty burger, but this was a little thin. The cheese was a half slice of American and should have been bigger. The burger was a little over done compared to my request and the staff could have been a little nicer. 

With all the seemingly negative comments, it could very easily be one of the best flavored burgers I have had. The smoke taste was in every bite, the meat was quality and tasted fresh, the self serve condiment bar was a plus, the red cream soda was a nice surprise. The frys were frys, a little crispy and perfect. 

I will be back and I will get the 1/2lb with extra cheese. I am sure I will be re-rating to a 5 if the staff steps it up too."
test_2852,This auto store has never disappointment me. I love how they have walk ins and are always available in the mornings. My radiator fans weren't working. They called me after they inspected my car before they did any work on it. They informed me that a fuse was blown and it was at no charge. They also let me know that my break pads and rotors were in bad condition. This explained another problem of why my car shook so much that no other shop was able to solve for me.
test_2853,"This is my 3rd BMW, I had to trade in my beloved 2005 545i because it had 143,000 miles that I put on the car and needed some very expensive repairs done. Opted to trade it in for a newer car which is what I did.  We had 2 sales people handle our whole process (it took me 2 days to decide on which car I wanted)  and it was a wonderful experience from the search for my car to the test drive on day one to the purchase the next day. Thank you TK & Ross!! I love BMWs and have used this dealership for my other cars for service and repairs in the past with no issues! TK was exceptionally knowledgable about the cars I looked at and wanted to be sure I was getting a car that had as many bells and whistles in it as the car I was trading in, he wanted to be sure I was happy with what I was getting in a newer BMW.  TK's follow up call the day after purchasing the car was sweet! I have never had a sales person follow up after a sale to be sure everything was good with the car I just bought. I have referred a couple of friends already and have passed his business card along with Ross's Info, they are interested in the 3 series...I don't understand the negative reviews here, like I said this isn't my 1st BMW and it won't be my last. I have used this dealership and love that when I walk in my service advisor Ceasar knows who I am, and that says a lot especially since I'm not in very often unless my car needs service. Over all it was a GREAT experience buying my new car here!!! Thanks again TK & Ross!! I LOVE my new 528i !!"
test_2854,"I've pick up some sushi at Ai sushi twice now and I'm pretty impressed. The fish was pretty fresh and beautifully presented. I loved the variety of sushi on the platter and it was super easy ordering through phone and picking up. I didn't need to wait super long and it was packed and ready to go each time. 
Yes. Fast. Bless."
test_2855,"The Toronto Underground Market definitely has 5 star potential. The first event was a huge success - however, there was room for improvement and I'm sure they will nail it after a few more months.

We arrived early; 10 minutes before they opened the doors. I believe this really was key to having a good time. By 7:30pm there were long queues for nearly every stall and people were waiting 30 mins to get at most of the popular items. Early on in the evening was fab though as we didn't have to wait.

There were 25 food stalls. I think they needed a bit more variety. There were probably too many ""dessert"" stalls in the mix. Lots of sandwiches too.

Stuff I tried:

My absolute FAVOURITE dish - by far - was the grilled cheese sandwich on jalepeno cornbread with cheddar, refried beans and guacamole on top from the ""Comida del Pueblo"" stall. SO GOOD! ($5)

Big Smoke Coffee Co had $3 pork belly sandwiches. Self serve toppings with a good variety.

Chorizo Taco from La Carnita - blah, really? I dunno...I feel like this place is overhyped. Yes, the taco was tasty.   But it was a rip off, seriously. $4 for 1 tiny taco? Not sure this was worth the obscenely long wait.

BBQ Jerk Coco Sandwich - this was the first one we tried, I thought it was quite nice. Cannot remember the vendor name. $5 (worth it).

MacarOONs (yes, the coconut kind) by the Lunch Room. We were given 4 huge macaroons for $3. Bargain and really delicious.

I thought some of the food stalls were overcharging, but others were really well priced.

The vendors should work on having a combination of pre-made/ready items and ones made fresh, that way they can move the lines along faster. I'd like to see a bit more food variety, but overall this was a killer first event and really well executed."
test_2856,Vicky had changed my life. I was suffering from adult acne and scarring - between the peel deal and Vicky's facial deal - I'm so excited and proud of my new skin :) Vicky is wonderful and friendly. She truly LISTENS to your concerns and takes her time to really meet your needs. Love love love.
test_2857,"Excellent 5 star service received at Optic Gallery on N Stephanie St.  Travis and Teresa did a great job advising me on new Anti-Glare Lenses for my Hugo Boss glasses.  They went over multiple shades of tint to custom my request and im very happy with the results.

Each time I have visited this branch of Optic Gallery the team goes out of their way to help and give the right advice.  Great selection of frames too at reasonable prices.   Thanks again guys appreciate you!"
test_2858,"I know, I know, it's a Charlotte institution. Maybe I just don't get it. For me, Beef 'N Bottle is like reading The Great Gatsby; everyone tells you that it's amazing, but in the end, there are very few likable characters and you're left feeling like you wasted your time.

I'll start with the positives. I had no trouble making a same-day reservation, and we were seated immediately upon entering, even though we rolled in a bit early. Parking was a cinch. Our server was knowledgable and attentive. The menu is easy to navigate, and the kitchen is happy to customize your meal. Everything we ordered came out in a reasonable amount of time, and we left with full bellies.

There were, however, a handful of things that keep me from raving about Beef 'N Bottle like so many others. First, when our hostess seated us, she asked if we were celebrating anything that evening. I mentioned that it was my date's birthday. When our server greeted us a moment later, he came bearing glasses of champagne, declaring ""happy anniversary!"" Close enough. 

The two of us were sat at a four-top table in the center of the restaurant. A wooden pillar was between our table and the next, and it's apparently used as storage for that folding table waiters use to support their trays upon serving. This led to servers reaching around us several times during our visit to grab the folding table and tossing it back with a clunk once their tables had been served. 

We decided to start with a dozen raw oysters. I'm familiar with gulf oysters and know that their consistency is different from east coasters, but I still feel like you shouldn't *have* to chew your oysters. I could be wrong, but this tells me that those guys weren't at all fresh. Next we had the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous and presented well. Our server mentioned that ""they like to make the cocktail sauce spicy,"" but even his warning didn't prepare us for the horseradish assault we were about to experience. I'll be sure to come back next time I have a cold, because that sauce cleared my sinuses within seconds.  

Can we talk about the famous salad? While the bleu cheese dressing was exceptional, I can't understand why we're all so excited about building our own salads. The iceberg lettuce and provided toppings are basic at best, sliced too large for easy eating, and utterly wasteful given that the puny plate you're provided won't hold half of what you're served. 

Our entrees came soon after. I had the filet and scallops, and I added crab meat on top. My four large scallops were served in a pool of wine butter sauce, which was easily the highlight of my meal -- my steak, though ordered medium, was quite dry and the butter was necessary. The scallops were tender, however, they still had the ""foot"" muscle attached, and both of us found shells in the crab meat atop our steaks. I can't help but feel that when you pay $50+ per entree, you shouldn't have to pluck inedible pieces out of your mouth. 

Overall, Beef 'N Bottle didn't live up to the hype for me. Now that we've crossed it off our list, I can't imagine we'll bother with another visit."
test_2859,"In Vegas for a youth basketball tournament and tried to sit as a team in the restaurant. After taking our orders, we were notified that we would have to split up by family/table  because it was more conveinent for the servers when making out the checks. We sat there for another 25 min and no one ever came to take our order nor did they deliver the original round of beverages. On the way out I mentioned this to ""Mike"" the manager and all he did was turn around and walk away. I also mentioned it was my son's 11th birthday and all the kid wanted was a milk shake.....which never arrived. This place has themselves confused with a 5 star restaurant."
test_2860,"Got the Chocolate raspberry, cheesecake cake, glazed, maple bacon, pistachio, and chocolate glazed donuts!

AMAAAZZINNNGG! Definitely got me going back for more. The donut bread part itself is delicious and chewy. The flavors are tasty. Absolutely loved the pistachio it was my favorite and the cheesecake was creamy and on point with a little crunch. The maple bacon melted in my mouth and the glazed was perfect (especially warmed up!).

The place itself looks fun! Very big and open. I enjoyed the openness and it's great for groups!

This girl has a big mouth for these bigmouth donuts!"
test_2861,"Our first time here.

Decor was very cool.

You could bring your own wine (cork fee is $15) - very cool.

Food was decent - the one thing I would question is menu vs. portion size. I ordered the 12oz Ribeye - ordered it rare. I know the weight is determined prior to cooking, but that steak came out to me at about 6oz."
test_2862,"I went to Physicians Physical Therapy (Avondale) for my tennis elbow I have had for months, I also had pain coming from my neck which caused me horrible headaches, most likely from a pinched nerve.  Before I started PT, I couldn't do simple things, like putting something in the microwave, take out the trash, brush my hair or vacuum.  These guys are so wonderful at what they do and really do care, not to mention make you feel like family.  I feel great and am able to resume my normal activities without any issues.  Thank you guys.  Your the best!!!

test_2863,"Glad Brewsters was full because we walked over here. Great ambiance walking in. Greeted with friendly host/ man in charge. 

I ordered the Don Andreas because I was craving avocados and cilantro together. That pizza was on my table in about 6 minutes and cooked perfectly. It was angels singing in my mouth. Unreal food. Going back again and again."
test_2864,The food was a 2 stars... Plus one of the waiters was really RUDE!! I just assume he was having a bad day..
test_2865,"Just like the reviews here in Yelp, the Pickle Barrel at Yorkdale Mall has a lot of inconsistencies that really makes this restaurant disappointing.

I've been here less than half a dozen times and it's gotten progressively worse. I had a bad experience with our server and our food during my last visit in April.

Our server expressed her disinterest in serving us from start to finish. She didn't take down our orders, insisting that she knew them, despite there being some dietary restrictions. Lo and behold, those things ended up in our food.

I got the PB House burger from there and there was a real lack in flavour. I only know that because I've had it on multiple occasions and I loooooved it.

I find big restaurant chains lack the ability to change when staff don't seem to care about their customers. Not sure if this location will likely change, but because they're situated in one of the biggest malls in Ontario, they'll always have customers."
test_2866,"Our six month old golden retriever got spooked during a firework show and ran off. A good Samaritan found him 3 1/2 miles from where he started, we brought him home and he just didn't seem like he could catch his breath. We took him in to PVSEC totally panicked, scared, and praying that he was going to be OK. They immediately took him into the back, and a full x-ray to see if there was any trauma. He had long contusions as the result of trauma, either from falling from a height or being hit by a car. The doctor was extremely comforting and told us the taco was going to be OK but that he needed to spend the night at the hospital on oxygen as his breathing was so belabored that to take him off of the oxygen would jeopardize his recovery.

We feel like he's in really good hands here, we've heard good things from other folks who have used this facility, and they were extremely cooperative with our vet when she called to check in on things for us.  The waiting room at the emergency vet is one of the saddest places on the planet, there's nothing that pulls on my heartstrings like a distressed animal. It's nice to know that there are places to go when the ones we love are not ok."
test_2867,"Great place for burgers and waffle fries. Excellent real milkshakes, super clean,  staff were friend and efficient"
test_2868,"I brought my 3 month old daughter in due to wheezing and coughing. I'm a mother of 6, but having a 10 lb. baby struggling to breathe is a nerve-wracking situation. My almost 3 year old accompanied us and  got to work playing in the waiting room while I filled out the paperwork. We were taken back to a room quickly and the male nurse who assisted us gave my son some stickers to keep him busy. The doctor came in after a short 15 minutes and was so compassionate and warm. He eased my fears and explained that she had a viral infection, and told me how to help her be more comfortable without giving her any unnecessary medications. He really took his time with us and never once tried to rush to the next patient. This urgent care is about 25 miles out of the way for me but I will be bringing my kids back here if I ever have the need. (Let's hope not!) By far the best experience I've had in 13 years as a mother!"
test_2869,"very romantic, had the lamb for the entree wch was cooked  and served to perfection, and accentuated by the fresh mint it came with, my fave was the crab ravioli wch i got as an appetizer, (seafood is my nirvana). tonight my date chose the tenderloin wch i almost got (he chose medium well, yuch i think he just ruined his steak, oh well) replete with asparagus and a side of potatoes. we were both too full for desert after sharing everything.  if you're on the west side in summerlin and are able to make reservations, check out this establishment. it's fine dining (slightly less than strip prices, but worth it), great table service, and romantic from my vantage point! p.s. you can also eat outdoors under the night sky a REAL sky not forum shops fake sky, it's absolutely breathtaking and maaarvelous!!!"
test_2870,"Not what we expected. My wife and I came here thinking we were coming to an ice cream place hence the name right? They serve regular food, speciality drinks and about 6 sundaes/floats. I had a spicy watermelon, its was okay. The cashier asked did I want the tamarind straw she said it comes with it I said sure which had a funny taste.  Looking at their menu in depth the straw was an extra $1. You have to be in the taste for a spicy watermelon float I'll just say. My wife had the cookies and cream which she enjoyed."
test_2871,"Grimaldi's Pizza has always been a hit with me, so when I discovered that they had gotten into the burger biz I had to try it. Yes, the coal-fired method gives the burger a unique charred taste that I will be back for. They also have one of the few independent soda machines I have ever seen."
test_2872,They've always been very helpful and upfront with me. And they are always willing to work with me or give a discount here and there if available. Thanks guys !
test_2873,"I was very pleased with the service I received from Pearson Eyecare Group. I had RK over 30 years ago and when I turned 40 a woke up and could no longer see, back to glasses I went.  I was told that I could only wear hard lenses and that they would have to be fitted and eventually we would find the right fit!  That never happened and I have been stuck with glasses ever since.  Dr. Macklin asked me why I did not wear contacts and I said because everyone said my cornea's were too flat from the RK and I would forever where glasses until I was eligible for a cornea transplant.  Dr. Macklin said that he felt he could fit me with an Acuvue daily where lense and he did just that.  I am now a contact wearer again!  I can not say enough about the service I received here and would highly recommend that you use Pearson Eyecare!"
test_2874,"the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly. sometimes cars are stuck on Baum blvd. also, the service is slow and poor."
test_2875,"So, I will start by saying that I was expecting the fair to be much much worse.  Mind you, I went yesterday, the day following the big teenage riot. The area does look very scary.  It's a rough neighborhood so be careful where you choose to park. We found close parking for $10, other places were charging $15. There was hardly any line to get in (pleasant surprise #1), we were literally inside within just a couple of minutes. Ladies do need to have their purses checked, so leave your weapons at home (half kidding).  

There may have been added security following the violent night before.  Plenty of po-po's all over the place, as well as a specific gang unit, so at no time inside the fair did I feel unsafe. While there was a good amount of people inside, we never had to wait in a line more than a couple of minutes for food, beer, rides, or bathroom (very pleasant surprise #2).  Oh, and let me touch on the bathroom-  I don't know the term for it, but it was so much nicer than a standard porta-potty, it was larger, had lights, running water sink, and get this- an air conditioner! Yes, that would be pleasant surprise #3. 

As far as the food, we had to try at least 1 fried item, and decided to go with the deep fried Reese's peanut butter cup, which was interesting. Not bad at all.  Chili cheese fries, beer, and a polish sausage dog with peppers were also on our shameful menu for the night (no judging please). 

The fun night ended with a kick-ass country concert (Justin Moore).  The admission is actually free with standard fair admission, though we bought tickets for better seating (only $20). It was well worth it, and the crowd was great. I had heard so many negative things about the fair, and am very glad we decided to come check it out for ourselves. 

Tip -take a ride on the ski lift once the sun goes down for a great view!"
test_2876,"We got quotes from several pool companies in regards to cleaning our DE filter. His was by far the most reasonable. Rick showed up on time and cleaned our filter which hadn't been cleaned in over 1 year.  We were impressed enough with his work to use them as our regular weekly maintenance. Rick was extremely polite, immaculate and professional.  Every time I needed to contact Rick by phone, text or email, he was very quick at getting back to me and I know that our business relationship has started off to a good beginning."
test_2877,"Pretty darn delicious! They make their tortillas and everything is delicious and fresh! I recommend trying the Christmas style, which is both sauces! So yummy!"
test_2878,"Splurge sushi - the best kind of 'treat yo-self' sushi. 

You are seated at the chef bar, being pampered. You watch as the chef takes out each piece of fresh fish and prepare it right in front of you eyes. The anticipation and the wait makes every piece enjoyable. You chat with friends and there is no one to rush you with your meal. The chef makes small talk and the hostess is also super accommodating. It almost feels like you are a guest at their home and they are showing off their expensive knife and fresh fish from Japan (and Portugal, Alaska, etc) 

I understand traditional sushi has wasabi inside - but the amount was a tad too much for my tolerance. Some pieces had me tearing! 

All in all, it was a great experience and we all left with satisfied belly."
test_2879,"Worst place ever don't shop here , all dented damaged appliances , would you buy a car that fell and dropped why would you buy an appliance . It would be lucky if this thing lasts a year then you have to deal with all the warranty headaches and then after a year you have no warranty it's not worth it don't waste your time I learned the hard way
Don't do it 

The positive reviews on here are fake don't believe it

After doing my homework I found out this business has been in the news before for bad business practices and a few lawsuits"
test_2880,"I was recommended this by a co-worker so I went for lunch.

While the service was very slow even by evening standards, the food was fresh.

My order included:

Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll
Ebi Sushi
Smoked Salmon Sushi
Prawn Tempura Roll
House Roll
Dynamite Roll
Green Tea

While the service is slow as previously mentioned, it is pleasant. Hopefully, on my next trip, they will be faster!"
test_2881,"i can review mamma mia?  yay!  

so cute!  the story is a bit cheesy, but the songs are so fun!  ""dancing queen"" just made me think of our AJ singing karaoke at 25si.  i only knew less than half the songs, but i still loved the show.  it's just really ""cute"".  i went with a girlfriend which was a good thing.  i wouldn't make a guy see this show.      

my favorite part was in the end, after the curtain call, they came back and performed 3-4 of their most popular songs.  it was like being at an ABBA concert!

my gripe: you know you're in vegas when the concession stand isn't really a concession stand.  they only serve cold drinks....like alcohol.  when we asked for hot tea or coffee (which i needed because the theater was ice cold) they said no hot drinks.  ugh."
test_2882,"I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The ""Man O'War"" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. 
The only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  
Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! 
The reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! 
The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! 
After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. 
This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. 
The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing."
test_2883,"I've taken my daughter around pretty much all of the similar museums in the Midwest, and by far this is the best around!
 
It is not a ""science/tech or children's"" museum so not as much hands-on stuff, so don't make that comparison. It is in the ASTC network so take advantage of that if you have a membership elsewhere. My family plus father-in-law only paid $10 for his senior admission. 

Most museums of ""Natural History"" seem really old and stuffy. The structures and displays seem almost as old as the dinosaurs. Not so in Cleveland. All the exhibits seem fairly new and clean. Everything in working condition. 

Easily fooled from the map and descriptions, but this place is HUGE! 

Big plus is the wildlife center. Today did not reach 60F, so not many animals out, but I can imagine all of them being on display during Spring. Would love to come back here just for that reason."
test_2884,"Fuego is a good time Tex-Mex street food place. Don't go if you are expecting authentic Sonoran Mexican food. Interesting cocktail menu, along with a good arrangement of beer. Definitely try the Chile Relleno stuffed with chorizo and covered in panko breadcrumbs.  The blackened tilapia could be the best I've ever had. Good stuff!"
test_2885,"We had the best experience with E-Z. We originally made reservations with another company, but their line was too long.  Aaron, Bryson, and Mari made sure we had the car we needed as quickly as possible at the lowest cost. They were knowledgeable, considerate, and efficient. I highly recommend them to everyone."
test_2886,"Ask for a sample of the Sunday sauce! It's basically a meat sauce, and it's good! The meatball is amazing, and the garlic bread is absolutely FANTASTIC! They're located in the corner of a plaza so there's plenty of parking, and everything is fairly priced. Or new favorite place to go for Italian!"
test_2887,"Great beer, Great food, and Great service! We visited Cleveland for a hockey tournament and ate at Fat Heads on Saturday! Loved it so much we went again on our way out of town!"
test_2888,"I took my bosses car here to fix a few minor dents, a crack in the rear bumper and tail light and to fix the clear part on the hood and a few minor scratches all over the front of the hood. Our estimator was Erika Lopez. and she was amazing and very knowledgeable. I personally don't know much about cars so i asked a lot of questions and she did a great job explaining everything to me. On top of that, about 2 weeks later and the car was completely finished and looks great! I never had a hard time getting in contact with Erika and she always made sure to return my calls. We will definitely be back for future car repairs!"
test_2889,"Found this great place right here on Yelp!.  We started using the Daycare offered in anticipation of taking a 2 week trip, unfortunately without our dog.  Trip got cancelled due to emergency health issues.  Everyone here went out of their way to assist in any way possible while my husband was in the hospital and recovery.
Sarge (dog) loves coming to ""visit"" here. He gets to play with all the other big dogs, outside when the weather is nice or in one of the ""living rooms"" when the weather is not so nice. He comes twice a week and just doesn't understand if something changes and he doesn't get to be there.  Well worth the price and so great for him to socialize.
  I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for 1 day for a play day or boarding.  The cameras are great cause you can look in anytime to check out what the dogs are up to.  5 stars, 5 stars, 5 stars."
test_2890,"We have been going to the science center since it's beginning and it is just getting better. SO much to do, so little time.  Both children love it there (ages 6 and 10).  They are less interested in learning the science of the exhibits than touching them and making them do something but it keeps them entertained. Definitely go to the Planetarium - you don't get to see those everyday.  There is an IMAX but we never get a chance to go because we run out of time.  The traveling exhibits are great, as long as you don't have to wait in line very long. The memberships are great if you plan on going there more than once like we used to do when the kids were younger - you also get a discount on their summer camps (which are awesome).

Be prepared and you will enjoy it more:

1. It's expensive.  There is an admission fee, fees for the planetarium, fees for the IMAX, fees for the traveling exhibits and parking fees (even when validated). You can get discounts occasionally on groupon or dealchicken but plan on spending some dough.

2. It's time consuming. Plan on spending a minimum of 3 hours there.  Plan ahead and see what's playing at the planetarium and the times. There are different shows throughout the day. Same with IMAX. 

3. DO NOT EAT THERE. There is a cafe but don't waste your time or money on it.  It's terrible and expensive. Wear comfortable shoes and walk down to another restaurant for lunch and then come back. OR you can bring food in - there is a huge lunchroom on the side of the cafe for large groups.

4. It can be crowded.  Sometimes it's empty, sometimes it's filled with school groups. If you are not in the mood for crowds, you might want to pick another place. If you need a stroller, and it's crowded, it's a nightmare."
test_2891,"Came upon this sushi spot by accident and was deliciously surprised. We ordered edamame as an appetizer on a Tuesday when they were doing up to 50% select sushi rolls and apps. Our 2 year old loved the little soy beans. We got a little side of fried rice and the yaki soba noodle dish. Both delicious. We also ordered the the Magic roll, Naruto roll, spider roll, parma roll, and the smoky roll. The presentation was beautiful and our meal cam out relatively fast. It was super busy for a Tuesday but worth the wait. Amazing spot for sushi in the cleveland area."
test_2892,"High initial rating because Blossom Pure is the only organic halal meat supplier in the GTA. For conscious Muslim eaters, this place should be included in your weekly or monthly grocery rounds. 

I frequent the store once a month to purchase meat. The store also carries an array of dairy products, local produce, jarred delights, and other bulk grocery items. I used to buy eggs (from Hoffnug's Farms) from here as well, but found a shop closer to my home that sells them for a dollar less per dozen. In fact, several items in Blossom Pure, especially dairy items, can be found in health shops around the city with significantly less prices. I would recommend you only buy your meat here, and head to your local health food stores for the rest. 

The chicken, beef, and lamb from Blossom Pure are outstanding. Buying the fresh meat for homemade, personalized steaks, stews, curries, and grilling produces fantastic results. They also sell packaged organ meats, which are fantastic for grilling and hitting that daily needed dose of iron. Deli meats are quite good from here, too.

I will probably be a customer of Blossom Pure for as long as I'm a Torontonian, because I love what the store stands for and represents, and because, as mentioned earlier, it's the only one of its kind in Toronto.

I do, however, have an issue with the service. The owner has good days and bad days, in terms of his communication, or lack thereof, with customers (or maybe just with my family and I?). He once told my family to visit the following time with less of us present, and seriously, only God knows why someone could say something so horrendously stupid. Additionally, he always seems to have an issue when we pay with credit. Why keep the credit option if such a fuss is made each time?! 

If there were ANY other organic halal meat shops in Toronto/GTA, I'd be there instead. Kind, genuine, passionate, informative service is really important to me, and I don't seem to experience such at Blossom Pure."
test_2893,"Reading the previous posts.. i was eager to give this place a try. Upon walking into the place. I knew it was going to be painfully bad. There was much variety but the amount of food place out for each was minimal. Seafood was not fresh and it was warm. Greasy... food, tables, plates, glass. Taste wise.. only thing that was good was the fruits.

If you want to still think Tokyo Sushi Buffet is the best quality with enough variety to make it the best AYCE sushi place in Pittsburgh."
test_2894,"First time inside the discovery centre and I'd say it was worth the money and my time. I can see many people on this review weren't satisfied over the pricing, but that's because they're expecting some sort of Legoland theme park or resort for adults. I understand the high value in general admissions, but lets not forget about a few things, 1 being the brand, and 2 the upkeep to run and maintain the attraction. There's a 4D show that last for 15 minutes each with 4 different types of show. With the prices of movie theatres now, wouldn't you say paying around $20 a fair reasonable price to watch the 4D movies as well as enjoy their attractions? The foods are decent, the usual pizza and snacks, but if you want something different, there's an entire foodcourt in the mall you can walk to...

I took my 5 year old nephew (who loves lego) and my 8 year old nephew (who's grown up with lego) here and they both loved it. The 5 year old one actually cried when I told him we needed to go home 3 hours later. Their favourite part was the soft play, an area where they can run around like wild animals without worrying about getting hurt. I see other solo kids making new friends there, which is a benefit if your trying to get your kid socializing. My favourite part was building a car and racing them, spent a good chunk of the time there building legos with my nephews. Overall, the experience was great, not sure why I see bad reviews, but lets not forget that this place is for the kids, treating them to a lego experience that's close to home."
test_2895,"This place replaced Mama Mia's. I had the eggplant sandwich, which didn't even come close to the Mama Mia experience. The eggplant was just too soggy for me. That is all."
test_2896,They don't have the same people cooking looks like it's changes hands because nothing looks familiar and use to have happy hour and was in the other day and they said no happy hour and our would be server never seen her before she was Korean not thai to fat unsure of what's up with this place no one was there and there usually busy so I don't know
test_2897,"So, I'm in no position to really be saying yes let's go to Harry Winston, but let's admit it - what girl isn't a big fan of diamonds?  As far as diamonds go, I'm a big fan.  A bright shinning star fan.  

So when we passed Harry's we had to go in.  (Well we didn't have to, but I'm dating a man that has an affinity for pretty things too - he's dating me, right?)

I put on a necklace that I swear to you I would have worn vaccumming, and nothing else.  Of course Harry only has colorless diamonds.  I was infatuated.  Then William Friskhorn showed us a piece (a necklace) that is one of a kind.  None other in the world right now.  It was a mere 350k.  I choked.  I also tried to make my beautiful green eyes sparkle as much as the diamonds.

I tried on a 5 carat emerald cut VS1 (or 2) ring with baquettes.  I started shaking.  We had to get out of there because I started sweating.  I'm not ready for that.  But it was the most beautiful piece I have ever placed upon my hand.  I'm telling you, this ring could have competed with Grace Kelly's 10 carat.  It was AH--- MAZING....

So I've said enough about the diamonds, let me get to the store itself.  Not pretentious and there for service.  These jewelers know their stuff.  Treat you with respect, and really, really were polite.  I carefully placed William'ss card in Joe's wallet right behind the AmEx (just in case)...we did discuss my necklace choices over dinner.  But none came home.  A girl can keep dreaming.  If and when we do go back, I'd love to make to to Harry's.  

As an addendum - I had to update my review with William's name.  I mean I did do a great job on product placement in his wallet.  I had to text my beau and he had it right where I had left it and was able to provide me with William's full name.

William was professional and knowledgable.  (And pretty hot I might add).  Go in there and ask for him - he really made the experience so much fun for us.  Especially me!!

I'd even consider naming my Corgi Winston...I love the name Winston!!"
test_2898,My husband got us tickets and I could not believe it  Of course I took my 12 year old with me when we arrived we where so nervous we ended up being right in front of the stage omg we could not believe it .The security guard was talking to us and everything he was so nice. The show started at 9:30 and it was amazing from start to  finish jlo looked right me and my daughter multiple times smiled and had so much contact with all the people . ALL OF HER DANCES WHERE AMAZING ....SHE IS AN INCREDIBLE -PERFORMER ! All her dancers and back up dancers where so amazing also . It was high energy for 2 hours straight it is a night me and my daughter will never forget .
test_2899,Very disappointed in the quality of service and the quality of food. My wife ordered the shrimp bowl and there was no shrimp. We had to ask them to make shrimp and they acted like it was a bother. They brought the bowl out with no rice or beans. Food was dry and The staff seemed to not care
test_2900,Salon is beautiful and always immaculately clean. Staff is friendly and attentive. Great products and choices for mani and pedi!
test_2901,"This place services tasty dim sum until 3am.  The bartender at the sports book next door agreed with me that Noodle Asia is the best restaurant at The Venetian.

The shu mai and har gow are fantastic.  I usually get a beef dish over rice (can't think of the name) that is my favorite.  The service is very fast.

I have eaten here at least 10 times and never had a sub-par experience so I would have to say they are very consistent.  The only thing they have done consistently that I have laughed about is that they always forget to give me a pen to sign the check with.  When I ask for a pen, they always say ""not again"".  Oh well.  I am never in a hurry near 3am."
test_2902,"In my opinion this is the best Mexican sit down place in Charlotte. My favorite item to order are the fish tacos on soft corn tortillas. The fish is fried crispy and the chipotle sauce gives it some nice flavor. Their margaritas are pretty nice as well. They are a little on the weak side but they taste great. The restaurant decor is fun and funky. The music is loud enough to feel fun but not too loud to have a conversation. The service has always been excellent, even on busy nights."
test_2903,"Just had lunch. Our first time here. Come hungry because the portions are very generous! Lunch for me was the camelback panini which came with excellent fries and an unexpected treat of a bowl of their freshly made soup! My wife had blueberry filled pancakes (4 large) which she said were very good. She brought two home. Other then a few start up training things which we really did not notice I would say this place is a home run for the owners. Great service, great food, great staff and reasonably priced! We will be back soon."
test_2904,"Awful experience. Drinks were empty, had to ask multiple times, 2 managers walked by and were too busy talking and laughing to notice. Crab was impossible to get out of shells. Went back 3 times for top round and gave up it was never there. The sushi was warm. So sad because the hotel is SO amazing. I'm honestly shocked and disappointed."
test_2905,"This is one of my favorite spots. 

The food is amazing and the service is great. The employees who work here are always friendly and attentive. 

Before taking on my vegetarian life style I tried the teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, and chicken katsu. For you meat eaters, this is exceptional teriyaki and you will be pleased with anything you order. 

Since switching to the vegetarian diet, I still enjoy the salad and the egg rolls from here. The salad dressing is so yummy! 

Friends of mine have tried the pork and fried rice and they have thought it to be great as well. 

This is a great spot. Highly recommend you try it."
test_2906,"Being a patron of the original Habit in Cali for many years, I was skeptical! Shoulda known that The Habit would not disappoint, period! Amazing burgers, just like home! You gotta try the Santa Barbara Burger with a side of the tempura green beans and their homemade ranch! You will be a SoCalBeliever of The Habit in no time!"
test_2907,"Ate here last night, the owners are extremely kind and interested in how they can improve asking for any comments, portions are very generous and food qualify is excellent. I had the pad thai with chicken and my girlfriend had the pho, both dishes were absolutely delicious. They also have a huge selection of bubble tea's, we had the mango and the coconut and both were great. We will definitely visit again."
test_2908,"One of the better AYCE sushi buffets in the area. It's quite expensive, but so good! I love their golden shrimps and maki rolls. The dessert is yummy too. I would say this is basically the same as Ten-Ichi (perhaps owned by the same person lol!?). Their menu items are extensive, and I have yet to be disappointed! They do get extremely busy during weekends though, so reservations are key in getting a table!!"
test_2909,"The course is in great condition and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes. 

12 dollars for the 9 holes."
test_2910,"Too bad the seats I had were all the way at the top. Without my glasses I missed the vibrant costumes.

The show was pretty faithful to the story, pretty much a line for line recreation. The actors were great, especially the actress that played the role of rafiki (cant quite remember her name).

If you enjoyed the lion king on film, you will love this show."
test_2911,"I like the concept. But, I did not enjoy Happy Dog. I got a chorizo chili and cheddar hot dog which was ok. I tasted a sloppy joe bacon hot dog and I did not like it. Tater tots with cheddar were mushy. Coke was watered down and melted the ice almost immediately. TVs, music, and interior had a 1960s-1970s drug vibe which I did not like. Prices are fair $6 and its cool you can get froot loops or spaghetti o's and the secret sauce is ok, service good, casual atmosphere."
test_2912,"Went for dinner.  Stood there for 10+ minutes with not a single hello, no hostess, no notice to staff from pick up counter to other staff that someone was waiting to be seated. Nada, crickets.   We could see they were congregated in the kitchen some eating, some stacking dishes, they looked at us and ignored us. Each one of them.  

When I asked if there was a manager on duty the pick up window said yes and was polite about it.  My husband counted at least 8 staff and when he went to the back to get someone's attention a young woman came out and said . ""We don't have a hostess this evening"".

 No, ""sorry to keep you waiting"", no apology Ir reautiinnif any kind.   We said how long we had been waiting and that's when she threw us a snooty look and continued with excuses instead of ""let me get you someone, sit where ever you want I'll send someone right over,.."". She just disappeared back into the kitchen again with us having no idea if we were going to be seated or not.  So we left.   Don't waste your time going there.  Pick another place."
test_2913,"Analog is a nice cafe, although usually pretty crowded. I got a latte, and it was alright. It's not anything special, and its kind of expensive. However, the staff was incredible, and very friendly. Will be coming back, the location and ambiance is really great."
test_2914,"Before leaving Vegas we stopped in at lou's and I cannot recommend this place enough! Patty is the best damn waitress this town has ever seen and this is after waking up at 2 am to make home made cinnamon rolls that melt in your mouth! Food was great, prices are even better. Definitely plan on returning for our next trip to the strip!"
test_2915,"I'm organic obsessed! I love Trader Joe's. I love their selection of milk & yogurt. They sell almond, soy, coconut :-) All the things that make me happy!. 

Almost every single time I've been to this location they had killer free samples of food and drinks. It always leads me to buy whatever it is I sampled. 

They have a decent wine selection-- nothing super high end, but they carry all the basics. 

""Mama Grace"" is my favorite cashier. I love her personality and even though her line is always the longest-- it's worth the wait. She will make you smile. 

I just bought a pretty basil plant from there this week. YUM :) 

Trader Joes is a more affordable Whole Foods. It's a must try. I love everything they sell. From the salads to their ethnic section--- it's an A+

My newest unhealthy obsession is their ""Cookie Butter"".. That's right. It's cookie dough-ish spread. Heaven. Bliss. Yum-ness."
test_2916,"Great place for some great tacos! The carnitas are juicy and delicious, the burritos taste very fresh as well.  One of the best parts of this restaurant that might be underrated is the tortillas! Both the flour and the corn are worth the trip alone. Delicious!"
test_2917,"Great fast food place. Great service and decent Indian food, flavors and quality for fast service. Chipotle-style with different option combinations and price. They don't make the food right in front of you, but you can see their ovens and food stations behind enclosed glass. Very clean, slick and open inside.

If you're looking for authentic food, you may want to find a sit-down place (e.g., Jaipur Junction far away in Hudson is my favorite). However, this establishment pulls off this newer fast food concept very well, with friendly service.

Quality of meat (e.g., lamb) could improve but the naan was tasty. The food is a tad oily for me, but I overall really like this place.

----

The chicken tikka masala definitely improved in taste since being here last, months ago.  Grilled chicken and I enjoyed the fact I could combine the mango sauce and tikka masala sauce myself.  I also really enjoyed my mango lassi."
test_2918,"Five stars because for a free zoo, this definitely surpassed my expectations. Definitely recommend donating to keep such a great community organization alive. My favorite exhibit was the polar bears! Plenty to see and do for all ages."
test_2919,I've ordered a variety of things here since my last review-all much better than the pad Thai! They have really great healthy options. The delivery is so fast to boot!
test_2920,"Another great experience at Taco y Taco. Michael, our bartender, is patient and knowledgeable, taking the time to answer all of our novice questions about mezcal. He even offered tastes of several before I finally settled on one. Amazing guest service! I will return..."
test_2921,"Let me start by saying that we used to only go to Discount Tire as they used to have the best service and prices but they are going downhill fast. Maybe it's just this location. We've gone there since it opened and the staff has all changed. I went there last week. I had a tire that came apart while I was on the freeway. The cords from the tire unwrapped and got all caught up around the underneath the car including around the brake cables. We were able to get over and miraculously no damage to the car but the tire literally was cut away from the vehicle. As there was still quite a bit of tread on the tire and it came apart, surely that is covered by the warranty I purchased right? No....I was not treated well. The first thing the clerk told me was ""you bought the cheapest tires on the market"". News to me, I bought them right there at Discount. While they were inexpensive, I thought they were ok or why would they even sell them. He then told me this was ""normal"".  Normal? I asked incredulously. ""Yes, they are worn out and that is what happens"". Well let me go somewhere where they do not sell tires that fall apart and nearly get us killed is what I said. Now he looks up our file and at first can't find our record but then eventually did. I should also mention they did not have me down for an appointment even though I called the day before and set one and showed up 10  min before my appt. He comments that I do not drive many miles as they warrantied out a different tire quite awhile ago and I had not added many miles. I work from home. While I drive almost every day its not far. So then he tells me the tires are all worn on the inside and I should have replaced them. Hmmm... the outside looks fine so how do I know this as I do not routinely crawl under my car and as he pointed out Discount had warrantied out a tire and I'd driven very few miles since. So then how did they get worn out or did they fail to inform me and put me in a dangerous situation or are these tires just garbage? Tires should not come apart. That is ridiculous.. These tires come apart and that is a safety issue. If tires come apart routinely when worn out then we'd all be in serious trouble. So then he tells me ""I'm going to help you out"" and offers 50% off of one tire. But he tells me I need 3. Three? Well low and behold the one tire that is not the same brand is still ok. I've never heard of replacing three but he kept suggesting it. I said no, I wanted all 4 then. Suddenly that 4th tire is too worn out to be pro-rated. Totally frustrated I said give me a quote for 4 tires that won't get me nearly killed. He told me about a few brands in the $99-$135 range (per tire) but quickly commented they would last me ""maybe 20,000 miles"". He never mentioned any warranty on them, just that I could purchase road hazard but it would not cover any wear and tear and maybe I'll get 20,000 miles. I said I want a safer tire than I had, and then we suddenly were up at the $235 per tire range. I finally settled on tires in the $135 range and he quoted with 50% off one tire. He told me he'd call me the next day when the tires arrived so I could come in and get them installed. He never did, still never heard from him. So I went to Big O instead. Super nice people! They took one look at my tire which I had thrown in the trunk complete with the yards of cords we cut loose and all and they said immediately ""that tire shouldn't have done that"". Really?? So they got me in to a set of 4 tires better than what Discount quoted with a 40,000 warranted, aligned the car, and provided free road hazard insurance. Out the door, I was the same price as Discount only it included a warranty and the realignment which Discount doesn't even do, I would have had to go elsewhere and waited again. This really was there last chance with us. We have 3 drivers in our house. My husband stopped going there after he received better quotes from Big O and no hassles. My daughter got hassled at a different Discount (up in Prescott) and got ticked off and went to Big O up there. I only went to Discount still as my road hazard was there and I was used to going there. But honestly this is not the first time I got grief from them so this was their last opportunity and they blew it. They are not what they once were as an organization. Maybe other locations are better but I had an issue with Camelback failing to return my wheel lock and my daughter had an issue up in Prescott."
test_2922,"My wife and I had an anniversary dinner there recently.  It's busy on a Friday night.

I had the double-bone pork chop, which was a very big portion.  Be aware that it will be very pink in the middle.  I don't have a problem with this but FYI.  It was tasty.

My wife had a salmon entree that she liked.

Service was very good.

I was surprised that the coffee (decaf) wasn't very good but everything else was fine."
test_2923,This place is adorable! Lots of selection for cr√™pes and service is not too slow either. Their dishes are amazing and well laid out.
test_2924,Dinner tonight...off the chart good...garlic bread...off menu... best in Scottsdale... osso buco was wonderful.. pasta was perfect. My new favorite place.
test_2925,"I came here recently for a friends bday. This place is amazing. Our waiter brought us free champagne for her bday, free shots, and a free dessert. He even asked if we would like to go to any of the clubs after our dinner and that he could get us in, but we declined. I ordered a filet mignon, it was absolutely delicious!! Best steak I have had. The Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are amazing as well. The French fries were alright. I would definitely recommend this place!!"
test_2926,"I can't say enough how much I love everyone who works in this department store! I have picky skin, and they always manage to find me hidden gems that actually work! 
Not to mention I shop a lot online and 95% of the time they don't fit right and I'm always returning things and I get zero hassle from them! 
My beauty advisor Delia is amazing and knowledgeable and I think I've only shopped here with her for the past 6 months! Love love love! Nordstrom has been my go to now it's my must!"
test_2927,"This is not a Greek Restaurant.  It is a fish restaurant.  Food is just okay.  Very, very expensive and no view.  You can do much better for Greek, for fish, and for a view, for much less.  Don't bother!"
test_2928,Very friendly quick service! Lowest price in town and cozy environment! The guy even offered us water and coffee!
test_2929,"Bigmouth Donut is currently my go to spot for weekend breakfast and coffee. My overall food philosophy is to get the basics right. For a donut, the basics to me are a slightly crispy exterior and an airy but substantial interior. The donuts here meet my specs and top it off with exciting flavors. I never limit myself to only one, so I usually end up getting a plain glazed or cinammon sugar, and a topping glazed donut. Of the topped flavors I usually gravitate to the citrus side of the flavor space or to one of the specialty pastries like the apple fritter. The owners are super cool and accommodating to cyclists. When I've biked here they let me store my bike inside of their game room which is greatly appreciated."
test_2930,This place is so much fun. I'd suggest going on a Sunday right when they open. The lines start picking up around 4 pm.
test_2931,"The food is wonderful here. Baked goods and breakfast foods alike. However, if you're in a rush, don't recommend going here. I waited 45 minutes for an egg and cheese bagel and was terribly late to class one day. The sandwich was AMAZINGLY tasty, but I didn't have time for that. The cookies are wonderful as well!!"
test_2932,"I went to this office for several years but finally had it with the extreme wait times to see the doctor. NO problem with Dr.Hamburg's care. When I complained to the Office Manager, she was extremely rude!! Because of her anti-patient attitude, I will not be back. I was able to tell this to Dr. Hamburg and I hope it will change the Office Managers lack of skill in dealing with patients. 
I also told the doctor that his care for my situation was good, as are all doctors and that the office staff is what makes, or breaks, their success."
test_2933,"My wife and I discovered the Java Stop parked on the corner of Olive and Cotton Ln on our way home from a hike.  We decided to stop and order a coffee and an Italian soda.  The coffee was great and the Italian soda was even better.  The best part was the free biscotti cookie I got with my large coffee.  The shop itself is actually a vintage trolley which was converted to a mobile coffee shop, way cool.  A couple of days later, we came across Java Stop in Peoria at a food truck gathering.  Got another yummy coffee and a biscotti cookie."
test_2934,"Weekend hours for this location suck big time ! 10-6 on Saturday and Sunday? Really CVS ? U can't afford to pay for 1 more shift for your pharmacy on the weekends? AND u don't have any signs in the drive thru so we could see where the concrete barrier ends so if u have a low riding sports car like I do u end up hitting the barrier because u CANT SEE where it ends !! Otherwise the staff is awesome, just pissed about the hours and damage to my car !"
test_2935,This location has the best produce.Staff is friendly and the store is clean.
test_2936,"It was my mom's birthday we had this great weekend planned in Asheville, NC filled with food and wine -I had created an entire itinerary that I printed out. But as luck would have it her 18 year old dog got sick and we couldn't go...well the weekend was not completely ruined.  

Why not try a new restaurant in Charlotte?  LuLu has been on my list for awhile.  We walked in to a cozy little house for brunch on a Sat. around noon.  There were only a few other diners inside...we were all craving some bloody mary's.  The bloody mary's were decent nothing I would rave about but they hit the spot. Now to the food I ordered the Country Benedict - I love eggs benedict I order a version of them in just about any restaurant I go too - this was such a great combo at Lulu's Neese's breakfast sausage, jalapeno relish, fried green tomatoes I could go on and on well I will I also had grits with pimento cheese and my mom and sister had ordered french fries with aioli as there sides.  The fries were amazing with a brown sugar bourbon rub - I don't know where they came up with that but i will be back for more.

Great for brunch - will have to check out the dinner menu when I return."
test_2937,"In Pittsburgh from out of town. Menu is here in the hotel lobby, so we call and order. Menu says open till 11 and they deliver 7 days a week. Woman on the phone says they are doing pick up only ""and actually we're closing in 10 minutes (which would be 9).

Maybe update your printer menus and your online information then.

Sad, this guy who is here with his family just wasted 20 min getting orders for a place that won't oblige. See photo."
test_2938,"Galleria Mall's a bit on the grubby side. Unlike Dufferin Mall farther south, it hasn't had a makeover and looks pretty dated (early 1970s would be my best guess). The halls feel a bit claustrophobic, even with few people around, thanks to the low vaulted ceilings.

Don't expect anything high-end at this mid-sized mall; the main stores are Zellers and Price Chopper (not that I'm not a fan of them). There are some bargain/kitschy knick-knack stores here too, so if you're in the market for, say, a big plastic crucified Jesus, you can get it here."
test_2939,"All the indie joints WISH they were this cool. This place is the real deal. Unchanged since the 80s, this is what the Calgary I grew up in felt like. It's also nice to see the menu and the prices haven't changed since the 80s either!"
test_2940,"Geat food, especially braun rice sushi!"
test_2941,"Food - good.
Service - awesome.
Clientele - sketch.

Definitely a take-out v eat-in joint. 

It took me 14 years of living in the neighbourhood to finally try The Rib House.  Tasty tasty ribs.  The cook, in his amazingly white cook's whites, keeps turning and saucing the ribs til the bark is just right.  He hits them with a little bit of honey after plating/boxing.  So delish.   About $10/11 for a half-rack with fries/bun/slaw.  The sides are edible, tasty even, but not what you're going there for.

My partner in take-out is a fan of the cheeseburger cheeseburger cheeseburger.   Fully loaded with fries/slaw/soft drink - $6.   Beats Mickey D's any day.

Given the location and clientele (did they get booted out of the Legion across the street?) a truly great surprise in tasty eating.  

If we could eat in, it would definitely be four stars.

The cooking/prep surfaces are always immaculately clean.  Always important to note."
test_2942,Great menu and great value. Wife and I dined here for a date night was really impressed. The steak Neptune was great! Printed a free appetizer coupon online and they had no problem honouring it. Great service. We'll be back.
test_2943,"I've been going to this place since it opened and it is fantastic. Very clean, fresh food ( delicious as well). Great service. Good for group events and parties. Family friendly as well. It's a very fantastic Vietnamese Restaurant. Love the Pho dishes, the appetizers, and rice an meat dishes. They have very yummy fried Vietnamese spring rolls. Give this place a try won't get disappointed."
test_2944,Such a nice ambiance. Food was pretty good but a little greasy. The line is extremely long but our concierge (Omni Hotel) gave us his business card and we were able to cut the line! Otherwise I don't know if it would've been worth it. Our waitress was also very sweet and gave us some good recommendations of things to do in Montreal.
test_2945,"My experience is always really good here and the girls are always real nice, but the last time I came in i dropped off about 6 shirts, 2 of which were very expensive shirts. I had asked about the starch they use and was told they would only lightly start a certain shirt as to not damage the material. When I got the shirt back it was nicely pressed, but the collar was heavily starched and looked caked on the collar really dulling the color of the shirt. It was the only time it has ever happened to me, but it was close to a $200 dollar shirt so I'm hesitant to bring expensive shirts back. Other than that the service has been great, but I cant give a 5 star rating because of that single shirt. I hope it comes clean :\

Patrick Richardson

10/27 - UPDATE

Brad, the owner of ORganiCare called me back and asked to take a look at the shirt. Personally I think that's really cool as I would run my business the same way. I told him I would bring the shirt in later today so we will see how it goes!"
test_2946,"*Red flag when the pharmacy technician confuses acetaminophen for psudoephedrine. 
So dropped off a prescription at 2pm on Thursday was told 1 hour. Went back at 5:30 and was told that the prescription was written wrong and that they need to get a hold of our doctor but since it was after 5 there was nobody in the doctor's office. Why they waited until 5:30 to call is frustrating as well as not calling me to let me know. Now it's Friday 1:45 p.m. and they still have not contacted the doctor and im On my way out of town without my daughter's meds."
test_2947,"I have been coming to Tonia for over five years, consistently. I'm a one that can be a little overly excited with my hair and like to go for that drastic change. For years I tried, failed and dealt with the pain and suffering that comes with bad, fried hair. But no one ever said a drastic change couldn't happen in one process... until Tonia advised me and I trusted her to go with it! My hair is ethnic with a mind of its own and she has always made magic happen! From being bleach blonde pixie short, to mid-length dark brown trying to embrace my natural curls. She sees my vision and by following her advice I've never been let down in all 5 years. She's truly her own artist, give her an idea and she'll make it better than you could have imagined! Just don't expect the impossible to happen over night. You'll be happy it didn't, that I can promise! From her adorable cozy studio, flexible schedule, impeccable talent and her incredible prices, she truly can't be beat. Don't ever settle when it comes to your hair, with Tonia you'll never have to!"
test_2948,"So ok I got a groupon for this place and that's really the only reason we went in. Heck we aren't even country fans but I love groupon!! Ok so We were there on a Thursday (1/30/14) for lunch and we were seated right away. After looking over the menu I ordered the grilled chicken wrap and fries and the hubby ordered a club sandwich(sans fries, fries are extra) I was very excited to try my food because it looked good( sigh I should have ordered the burger the safest choice) . My wrap was huge BUT where was the chicken....I searched and searched and only pulled lots of lettuce and corn and then ohhh yes there is my one piece of chicken (huh?) blah not happy. My hubby must have seen the starved look in my eyes so he shared his club sandwich. It was actually good but then again can a person really mess up processed meats on bread? 
Well...I don't think id go back it just doesn't seem worth it. Our waitress was a peach but great service for not so good food ( ehh). I think next time I'll stick to American diner at the nyny hotel."
test_2949,"Best wine bar in Montreal!  A lot of selection by the glass of unique stuff.  Somm does a great job there of changing the offerings.  

All the wines and food are written on a black board on the wall.

The food portions are small but very tasty and creative.  Very busy, highly recommended if you are in town"
test_2950,"I made the extra effort to come to IHOP just for a bad experience. It was super noisey, Uncontrolled kids, and to top it off the food was bad. My bacon folded like a tortilla, My hash browns were gooey as mash potatoes, The eggs were okay because you can't really mess up eggs. I'd say the best thing out of my meal was the wheat bread.  

A+ effort for my waiter having to work in such an environment, she made the experience tolerable."
test_2951,First time at this salon and saw Christina. I had seen how amazing all the girls at the salons hair looked so I decided to try this place since I just moved here and needed to find a new salon. My hair came out horrible. I had two chunky streaks in the front and balayage that didn't look natural it looked like there were chunks of blonde then brown and a line and different shades of blonde. I came in with all my blonde looking one color.  I asked for a haircut when I booked my appt. when I came in Christina said she didn't have time nor that it was on her list and I said I booked it. But nope she didn't have time even though I said I booked it. I paid 220 and tipped 20 percent for hating my hair. I came back in after I got to my car and saw it in the mirror  and asked to have it fixed. They said they didn't have time but don't charge for redos. I said I can't go anywhere with this hair. They finally gave me Loretta who was super sweet and nice but still didn't overall fix my hair. I'm flying back home to CA to have my old girl fix it now. I sent her pictures and she agreed it looked like it didn't blend and it was too chunky. I wanted to tip Loretta but the girls at the front said they didn't have change so I just gave my full 20 dollar bill for still not being happy and they were like r u sure? They should of said no. I felt they rushed to get me out of there bc they had their next client coming in instead of sitting me down and really going through my hair. I will be posting pictures of it. Nice salon but I won't return there. These girls need more education. I should of went to Jen who I was originally referred too but she was just booked up for 2 months.
test_2952,"I work in a weird part of town that is mostly industrial or fast food, and I became aware of this shop when they delivered a flyer to my office.

I've become a huge fan not only because I'm a Mexican food junkie, but I love that they'll deliver to my area.

Most of the fare is traditional, but they do have some American options for your less adventurous co-workers.

I have never had a bad meal here, and most have been great. I particularly dig the chimichangas."
test_2953,Good HK style restaurant with other homey comfort food....  The baked Portuguese chicken dish was our favourite.
test_2954,"Good: 
In Tremont - walking distance to library, excellent restaurants and bars. Close proximity to freeways and downtown. New and very well-equipped apartments at a good price, washer/dryer in apartments (all, I think). No gas, just electricity, keeps costs down. 

Bad: 
Section 8 and no security. Our car was vandalized twice in their parking lot within 1 year. There was a shooting of a tenant a few months ago, FBI raided an apartment the same week (I witnessed both of these events from my apartment). Noisy neighbors and visitors playing their car stereos into early hours of the morning regularly, can be heard with all windows shut and wakes us often. 

Tenants yell at each other constantly. A week rarely goes by without a few visits by police, ambulance and fire. Repairs by management take weeks, management doesn't turn air-conditioning on in hallways during summer because ""it's not legally required."" So, hallways often smell terrible because a/c isn't on and windows don't open. I asked management about aforementioned shooting and FBI raid and was met with total ignorance. We asked Management to let us out of our lease early because we are worried about safety and they informed us it would cost at least 3 month's rent and loss of security deposit (one month's rent). A lot of money for them not providing any security. Car repairs are adding up too. 

Conclusion: Great for section 8 residents from East Cleveland, but at the expense of everyone else."

test_2956,"VIP Ontario Tours provide luxury personalized service for the price of mass tour prices. They are dependable, punctual and a lot of fun to be with. Emil, one of their drivers is a real character with funny stories, jokes and invaluable local information. He is a pleasant, caring service oriented individual.

test_2957,"The taste is so rich, especially when I drink the tea with cheese! Best bubble tea ever! It is much better than Coco or others."
test_2958,"Where to start??
The hostess was polite she sat us down.
Mind you, this restaurant wasn't even busy. It was a family before us. 
Back to the story. 
Our server was Marina, seemed scared to even talk to us. We ordered from the Happy Hour; Nachos and Rib Tips. My sister and I can't eat onion. We asked her does anything have onions, she said no. 
A couple comes in and they are sat down as well two tables down from us. The first family, my sister and I are just seating down looking at one another confused  what's taking so long. Well, our server and another server are just at that third table that got sat down. 20-30 min pass by we can't even get attention. Thank god for the hostess, she tells her, hey I think your food is ready... Our server yeah yeah yeah I'll get it soon. Hostess brings out the food and goes to the server, doesn't even move or grab the plates just pointes at the our table. Hostess gives us our food, sees I need a refill, server then comes ask is everything ok. Doesn't even let us answer sees I need a refill just leaves. So now the hostess and server bring me two cups. Its ok I'll drink it I don't care at this point. So rib tips are good up until my sister finds a hair. We get to the nachos looks like throw up. We go through it find onions. Im like wtf at this point. Servers are at this third table talking talking and talking. I want to leave at this point. So our server walks by I raise my hand and tell her can we have our bill please. This is were she acts nice oh please take your time.. I'm just like really? Anyways I know bad service when I see it! Actually you can feel it. It was wack, just because we ordered Happy Hour and water doesn't give you the right to treat us like nothing. What happened to customer service? Doesn't that matter nowadays? Overall i wouldn't even give this place a star, but thanks to the hostess!"
test_2959,Very good sandwiches. It's like the Melt in Cleveland but much better priced. The sweet potato fries are amazing.
test_2960,Me and my 4 year old son plus my fiance and daughter ate at this restaurant. My son didn't want the egg on his sandwich so I ate it. Me and my son both ended up getting food poisoning. Four days later he's staying in the hospital with a fever of 102 degrees and he's lost 4 pounds in a day of water weight. I contacted the McDonalds and they didn't show that they cared at all.
test_2961,"I give Partners and Emily a strong 5 stars & 2 thumbs up.  
We have excellent weekly private training sessions with Emily for 
our 10 month old Havanese, Piper.  We originally signed up for 5 weeks and have now added another 5 week session.
Piper also loves the day care!"
test_2962,"Wow, this place is like nothing I have experienced before. So many choices... They only have a few menu items but you can personalize them however you like them. Kind of like an upscale version of that chain of sub shops.

It was pretty intimidating at first, you could tell the regulars from the newbies like me. I stepped back and listened to a few other people order before I jumped in.

They specialize in enchiladas that they make in a little cast iron skillet so when it comes out of the oven it is hot and melty. It was really great food and I definitely felt like I needed to come back and eat there again. My wife ordered soup and it was really good too.

In Midtown Phoenix, there are a ton of choices to eat and it's nice to find someplace that's different from all the rest."
test_2963,The chicken Me Kong noodle is one of the best foods I've eaten in Pittsburgh.
test_2964,Several problems during my dining experience. Onions were too large in the salad. Meat was not thinly sliced for burrito preparation. My order came with guacamole but server did not make us aware of that so we ordered a side of guacamole. When I brought it to her attention she said that she didn't think the manager would be able to help us so I had to call the manager to straighten things out. Even the water in this place tastes funny.
test_2965,"The hotel is beautiful ! 
This review is for the lost and found department.
im just really upset at them.
I forgot a book in the nightstand drawer, i called the lost and found they didn't even call back, so i called them again 3 hours later, they said that they did check and didn't find it, witch makes no sense at all because i know for sure it was there !"

5/5 visit√© en novembre 2015"
test_2969,"This was formerly Old Carolina BBQ. Same owner. This place re-opened under a new name on Monday (10-12-15). We went on Friday evening and it was awful. Lots of people. Lots of VERY confused staff. We placed our takeout order at 6:20pm and did not receive it until 7:05pm. This was for two hot dogs, loaded fries, 1/3 ribs and one leg/thigh chicken ($31). We observed many orders being returned to the kitchen from the dining room, countless patrons asking for refunds after long waits for carryout. Although continuous apologies were handed out by the staff we were extremely unhappy customers and the best tasting item we ordered was the fries. This place is pitiful. BBQ quality is the same (exactly) as Old Carolina and the dry chicken, too."
test_2970,Great food and super affordable drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are on your way to Cleveland. Service was great also. They all work together which you do not see often.
test_2971,"We purchased a sofa from Andrew's Furniture. Nice sofa, but turned out to have a what assumed was a factory defect. It was disappointing but the manager ""Guy"" was very accommodating. The delivery guy Mike?? was also very nice and professional. Overall, EXCELLENT Customer Service. I would recommend Andrew's Furniture to family or friends."
test_2972,"My friend and I passed by Ravi and we were hungry. So we went in Ravi give it a try. They recommended us the most popular soup hot hot broth. Omg... it tasted so good. We both love it. When u see their food truck at liberty village area again, I definitely will get lunch again!"
test_2973,"We have been here pretty much since they opened.  Stars are hard to rate since we used different rooms depending on who is in our crowd.  Suite with two bed, king bed, queen bed are a bit different.  So ratings are base on overall experience, not each individual room.

For the price paid I am appalled there is no WIFI.  Price increased to $17+ a day for WIFI! What? every hotel should have standard WIFI because we rely on it to figure out what to do in vegas! What to eat/to play/to drink, traffic, venues, tickets, etc. I cannot even begin to list all the possibilities and needs for WIFI especially in Vegas.  So that is one big star off.

I would take another star off for no coffee pot, or even hot water.  Shouldn't there be a standard to have hot water or a pot in the room.  I just wish for the price you are given that or even some coffee products.  Even cheaper places have it as a standard.  I wish there could be another 1/2 star off but this place is not really a 3 star hotel...with all the other good things in it so 4 it shall stay.

Linens are clean, bed comfortable.  Bath clean, fully stocked. Blinds automatic with remote, there isn't much to complain so it shall remains. 4 outta 5."
test_2974,"Fabulous 50s decor with red vinyl and chrome booths and chairs. The 50s music was fun too. Service is friendly and attentive. They were more than willing to accommodate substitutions in the menu. We even got our own cool pot of coffee for our brunch today.

A fun menu selection from lite fare to a heavy breakfast. Everything tasted very fresh and well cooked.

I also appreciated the rectangular outlay of the place as even with a table of 10 sitting next to us, the noise levels were low as compared to other breakfast places.

There was also no line up on a Sunday morning! That may not last as this place becomes more popular.

I highly recommend it."
test_2975,"Food was excellent, service was hit or miss. The waiter would disappear for extended periods of time, which was somewhat bothersome but overall was made better by delicious food. The cheesewineburger was excellent, and I liked the fries so much that I ordered some more.

Keep in mind, looks can be deceiving. It doesn't look like much from the outside but Wineburger is definitely worth a stop."
test_2976,"4.5/5
My gf and I came here for dinner, during Winterlicious. What made me choose this restaurant was their selection for dinner. It was consistent and I wanted to try everything on the menu. Even though, I already knew what I was going to order. The ambience of the restaurant was great. The hostess (I wish I got her name. She was very accommodating). She took our jackets and was very friendly.
For the appetizer, I got the French Onion Soup. I've had a lot of French Onion Soup. Although it may be visually appealing, with all the cheese, I base the soup on the broth. There was only one place I thoroughly enjoyed it at (Which was Colette. Their soup was made with beef oxtail) whereas other places, it lacks the flavour of the beef broth. Annona's French Onion Soup was good, had flavour (Onions were overpowering, which to me is a good thing. I love onions) but I just wish it had more of that beef broth flavour. 
For the main course, I got the Char-Grilled Beef Medallions, cooked rare. I was certainly pleased to see that the beef was cooked rare. 
For dessert, I had the Chocolate All The Way. Which was a layered chocolate roulade genoise, with couverture mousse, cassis gelee, cassis cubes, gold nugget, blackberries, chocolate sauce (Taken from the Winterlicious site, because I don't know how to describe it). I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. Hence the 4.5/5 rating. Should've had the Maple Creme Brulee instead.
Other than that, our waiter was attentive, friendly and quite possibly, set a record for how often he came back to pour ice water into our glasses. We didn't have to ask! (We like to stay hydrated). I'd definitely come back here again!"
test_2977,Perfect place to do your nails and eye brow waxing. There services were exceptional. They used very good products and the place was so clean!
test_2978,"When I arrived in Arizona. I asked the front desk at the hotel what the best restaurant in town was. Without question they said the Arrogant Butcher. To put it kindly, this restaurant has fantastic decor, but is an upgraded version of Applebee's. The filet was pathetic, the pasta was overcooked and the service was about as good as visiting an Applebee's or worse. I feel bad for the residents, who seem to think this is high class food. Good luck to you all..."
test_2979,"Gregg has wonderful customer service. 
Easy to deal with , honest about estimated times of installation.  Highly recommended for all of your Tire needs.The lobby is clean and cool in temperature yes it matters here in Arizona. 

Thanks Discount 5 stars in my book!"
test_2980,"Was hesitant when I first walked in with the flamboyant decor and the questionable reviews.... however I was so surprised how wonderful the food was. 

I visited the establishment around 1130am on a Saturday. Service was good, food came out in a reasonable fashion - portions were huge!

Definitely a must try in Vegas!"
test_2981,"Our air conditioner went out while we were out of town.  When we returned home, it was 98 upstairs.  Fans on and windows covered did not help significantly.  We were pleased when the technician arrived Wednesday morning and diagnosed the problem and while he did not have a new fan motor, Freddy contacted another Doctor Cool technician who arrived a little later and fixed everything.  We were so grateful for a cool sleep that night."
test_2982,Went during happy hour had a few apps that were very unique and had great flavor! The service was great as well as the atmosphere. Quality craft restaurant worth checking out if in DT summerlin!
test_2983,"Had breakfast here at 10 on a Friday morning. There was a 15-20 min wait time so they took our numbers and texted us when our table was ready... 

As we sat down at our table we were instantly greeted with a smile, felt welcomed,and given menus. It was small , almost cramped space but seated comfortably. Nicely lit and bright. We ordered the Nova Scotia with side of Red Velvet pancakes, Steak n Eggs, and the Daisy with a side of sujuk (beef sausage). For drinks we had iced coffee and their juice of the day (mango, turmeric and carrot). 

EVERYTHING TASTED GREAT! Food took pretty long but it might just be me spoiled to the fast NYC lifestyle lol.

Staff was great and overall we had a memorable time. Highly recommend and will definitely return when in Toronto.

P.S - Everything is organic and hormone free! their sugar is brown sugar!"
test_2984,"The meats are done very here.  This was my first time here and it is an instant favourite for me.  They have several locations but this is their take out location.  I've been to both types and the food is on point.  I ordered the chicken on pita, baba ganoush, chicken schnitzel dinner.  This was ample for 2 people and it was delicious.  They were also generous with their toppings too."
test_2985,Not very impressed. My food looked better in the photo on the window. I paid for the Hawaiian bbq wrap but it is bbq crap. They didnt even cut it for me. Not returning ever
test_2986,"This is my first and last time. I looked at the yelp reviews and thought it would be good for my boys and me and i was mistaken. They gave my oldest an outbreak from dirty clippers. My son has never had a rash like that from getting his hair cut and it went all around the back nape area and up above his ears. My youngest son has straight hair and they cut 2 holes where i can tell his cowlick was. And my hair was cut different on both sides, i had to go home and fix it. For a total of $75! I felt robbed and i wont recommend."
test_2987,"The last two times I have been there the service was awful, the appetizers were served still frozen and one person didn't get their meal till 30 minutes after the table had been served... Not worth it"
test_2988,"One of the most unique restaurants in Toronto.  The experience in itself was spectacular, not to mention the top quality sushi and the presentation of each dish.
Plan your visit well in advance as they fill up very quickly!"
test_2989,"A convenient spot to grab a bite and coffee.
This place has a lot of potential.

However, it seems a bit disorganized.  It might just be the placement of the furniture, but there's something that kind of feels ... awkward.  Like you showed up and the tables were set up last minute for people to sit.

The food is good!  But it's not the most comfortable or ambient cafe I've visited."
test_2990,"A friend had got me take out from this place. He'd gotten me the shawarma plate with the chicken and beef. And boy was I happy. 

The meat to veg ratio was great! I love the fact that they hadn't tried to cheap out on the meat. 

Second the amount of veggies were amazing. I for one need veggies and this was great. What I would have to say is that there is A LOT of rice. But to be fair it was flavourful and quite yummy.

Overall I'd definitely recommend what I had. I'm not sure about the sandwiches but Id def be back to give it a try. The plate can easily feed two; but if you've got a monstrous appetite; you'd want to have it for yourself. 

Also cannot comment on the restaurant itself as i've never been. But for the food alone; def worth take out."
test_2991,"I didn't know I liked french toast until I tried Cafe Moulin's!

For breakfast I'm usually a sweet over savory kinda gal, so I opted for the WALNUT ST. FRENCH TOAST. It was not too sweet at all.. so yummy.. I did add strawberries on top too!  There doesn't seem to be much seating, so I could see wait time being a problem because it seems to be a great breakfast/brunch spot. Good thing I came on a Tuesday morning so there wasn't a problem, but a decent amount of people came in during the time I was eating.

This was my first visit and I will definitely be coming back to try their waffles or crepes."
test_2992,"This shop is under new management, a suave looking cat, by the name of Will. I've been vaping for quite some time now and I've been to multiple shops. Even took a ""vape-cation"" just to visit Vape shops and see what another state has to offer. Will's customer service is by far the best I've ever come into interaction with. Definitely, swing by and ask for his recommendation on juices and set ups!! Ask him what kind of hair product he uses too. His hair looks amazing."
test_2993,"Between two friends and I, we ordered the squash poutine, buffalo tofu bites, the loosey, and the cheesesteak bulgogi, and for my vegetarian friend, the restaurant accommodated her with kimchi fried rice. I was obsessed! Not too pricey (about $18ish bucks each for all the food), and luckily we came early, because the restaurant began to get packed by the end of our meal. My favourites/highly recommended were tied between the squash poutine & the cheesesteak bulgogi for sure. Will 100% be back again!"
test_2994,"Brunch, lunch or dinner - it doesn't matter! This place is great! Wonderful patio for when the weather is our friend and a great atmosphere inside for when it's not."
test_2995,"A wonderful place where they serve you a traditional omakase sushi dinner. The attention to detail in the service, presentation and the freshness of the food is as authentic as the high end sushi restaurants in Japan.  

The fish, as everyone has noted, is flown in from around the world.  The spot prawns from Alaska were so frisky, they almost didn't stay on the chef's cutting board as he prepped them.  

The restaurant is delightfully small making it seem like you are being catered to at your own private table.  

Remember to make a reservation and ENJOY!"
test_2996,"We had to get 3 quotes for my new employer on moving my family from NV TO FLORIDA My husband  was in charge of gathering these quotes. It was down to 2 companies, both very professional and reputable companies. EXPRESS VAN LINE (Local company) and Allied. 
My husband and I dealt with Jason with Express and John with Allied, it was a tough decision but we chose Allied. We made a reservation but HR made it with Express Van Line instead of Allied, we had no knowledge of this until the day of the move when an EXPRESS VANLINE truck showed up at our door step. 

I called HR and found that they went with Expres Vanline by mistake. I couldnt cancel at this point because our lease was up on the APRIL 30th, we had to go with Express plus this company has great reviews so we figured heck, why not?! 

Express it is... 

Well, the move went GREAT. The movers were professional, polished and polite. They worked incredibly well and had our entire home packed and loaded in just 7 hours. 

We have a large 3 bedroom, Alexis (The driver) was great to work with and Jason followed up with us to ensure everything was on point. 

I didn't tell Jason about the mix up because I felt embarrassed that his company was chosen by mistake. He now knows but they did a fantastic job. 

This company deserves 5 stars, I received my stuff in GREAT condition and in a timely manner. 

I recommend Express Van Lines 100% even if its by mistake"
test_2997,"The Weather Permitting events are always a lot  of fun. What a great way to spend Sundays during the summer; live music, beer and food trucks. Pet and kid friendly. Like the layout of this urban nursery, once there it feels as though it's somewhere in the country. Prices for plants, fruits/veggies comparable with other nurseries."
test_2998,This is my second time here and no complaints the food is really authentic and coming from a home where my grandma made food to order like a restaurant these flavors take me back to growing up only downfall it's a little bit pricey but I'll keep coming back definitely recommend to those who know what REAL Mexican food is!
test_2999,"Amazing company! Troy and his crew were absolutely wonderful! Professional but personable! They trimmed one Palm and cut down 2 others. . Also dug up and removed 5 oleanders.

I chose Troy from your review!"
